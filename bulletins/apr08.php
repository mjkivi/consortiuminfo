The legal system that evolved to support that process ranked the rights of creators over users, because society lost little in the bargain.

			<h4>EDITOR'S NOTE:</h4>
			<h3>All for One and One for All</h3>
			<p>In the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb08.php">last issue</a> of <strong><em>Standards Today</em></strong>, I proposed the need to recognize what I called "Civil ICT Rights," which I defined as our traditional civil rights, as increasingly expressed virtually on line through information and communications technology (ICT) rather than physically and face to face. I also suggested the need to recognize the special status of the "Civil ICT Standards" needed to secure those rights.</p>
			<p>In this issue I return to the topic of virtual expression, this time focusing on collaborative rather than individual expression. In this case, technology has provided not just an expanded reach, but a more fundamental renaissance, as communities can, and are, coalescing nationally, regionally and even globally, allowing knowledge to be shared used simultaneously rather than sequentially. The result has been an explosion of interest in "openness" of every type &mdash; in standards, in software, in hardware, in development, in content, and more.</p>
			<p>The benefits that can be gained from such openness are bringing about a reconsideration of the proper balance to be struck between the rights of those that create and those that consume. Happily, it is the creators that are leading the drive to reset this balance, because of the gains that they can reap from this new spirit of collaboration.</p>
			<p>I begin this examination in my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong> by noting the degree of creative ferment that is ongoing in the marketplace, and suggesting that the legal system should allow this process to continue rather than try to codify its conclusions at too preliminary a state.</p>
			<p>I do a deeper dive in this issue's <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong>, placing the drive towards open collaboration in historical context, and providing an overview of the many types of open methodologies and subject matter that are being actively and enthusiastically pursued today.</p>
			<p>The <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection for this month provides a bridge between this issue and the last, announcing a human rights statement entitled <strong><em>The Hague Declaration</em></strong> that was issued this month by a new non-profit organization of which I am proud to be a co-founder. That organization is called the Digital Standards Organization (Digistan.org for short). You can read more about Digistan and its mission <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb08.php">here</a>. The Hague Declaration calls upon governments everywhere to recognize Civil ICT Standards (the Declaration refers to them as "free and open standards"). Hopefully, governments will heed this call to give special treatment to those "alpha standards" upon which our human freedoms rely.</p>
			<p>I round out this issue, as usual, with the latest installment of the <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> series, which focuses on the concept of "alpha standards" from a different, and less serious perspective.</p>
			<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this issue.</p>

			<h3>Patience and the Possibilities of Collaborative and Derivative Expression</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>Human cultures have deep roots, put down across millennia of shared experience.  Over time, societies develop detailed systems of law, morality and social conduct  to protect those cultures, and these frameworks properly adapt only gradually over time.  In some cases, changes are enacted self-consciously (as with law), while in others they occur organically (as with evolving norms of social conduct), but in neither case are they apt to morph abruptly.</p>
			<p>That is, until now.  Increasingly, fundamental and sustaining changes are occurring in the world around us that are comparatively sudden, and therefore present greater challenges to existing systems.  Because the cumulative effect of changes that occur deliberately and slowly tends to go unnoticed, we may be tempted to think of abrupt change as being, at best, a necessary evil.</p>
			<p>And indeed, much change can be unwelcome and daunting, such as the need to deal with the pressures of increasing population and decreasing natural resources.  But other transitions can be liberating and beneficial &mdash; although still daunting to embrace.  When this happens, we face the dual task of applying the strengths of our historical systems and values to address new realities, while at the same time resisting our predisposition to allow historical biases to stand in the way of embracing the opportunities of the future.</p>
			<p>One such liberating and beneficial opportunity I will call the greatly expanded potential for "collaborative and derivative expression" made possible by the Internet.  By this I mean the ability to not only share and build upon ideas, but for trans-national, self-selecting communities to form to collectively instantiate them, often incorporating the work of others as quickly as those modules are created.  The result can be discrete works (e.g., source code projects involving from a few individuals to thousands of developers), or more diverse, affiliated works of authorship (such as the Wikipedia, with its increasing number of largely independent language editions).  Any of these efforts would have been impossible to imagine as other than geographically local, slower moving projects in the very recent past, if indeed they would have existed at all.</p>
			<p>New opportunities, of course, are apt to raise new questions.  Looked at from the outside in, if a project does not carefully record the authors of discrete contributions, who can or should be held liable for infringement or libel if unauthorized reuse occurs or defamatory statements are made (and if the answer is no one, then who can be protected from such acts?)</p>
			<p>Viewed from the inside out, other issues emerge: who should own works of collective expression in order to maintain them into the future, and how?  Are the rights of free speech of those that contribute to works of collective expressions in any way different or weaker than those of the sole author of a work of self expression?  Should the rules governing fair use under copyright law be more liberal when creating Web-based, interactive "mashups," simply because the Internet enables far richer opportunities for expression than were conceivable in a world possessing only printed pages?</p>
			<p>And in each case, absent amendment by legislatures or reinterpreting in the courts, will existing laws dictate the "wrong" answers &mdash; answers that over restrict and under deliver?</p>
			<p>To derive the best answers to questions such as these, it is important to recognize that virtually all rules that restrict human behavior involve a balancing between the rights of the individual and those of society.  In short, the specifics of many laws have been determined not empirically and universally, but subjectively and situationally, based upon the assumption that a certain amount of benefit can be gained (or harm avoided) by society in exchange for imposing a certain degree of restriction on the individual.  When the facts underlying such equations change, it becomes appropriate to reexamine whether the location of the legal boundaries that evolved in the past should be relocated to better serve the best interests of all  concerned in the future.</p>
			<p>Is now such a time?  The answer is both yes and no.  Yes, because the benefits of both collaborative and derivative expression are becoming obvious.  But also no, because the exact new locations for such historical boundaries is not yet obvious.  Instead, what is most needed is patience and forbearance on the part of the traditional owners of rights in intellectual property and those charged with protecting those rights, in order to allow the rich and rapid experimentation that is ongoing today in a wide variety of projects and settings to continue.</p>
			<p>Such patience, I believe, will be well rewarded.  What we are seeing on a daily basis today is a fascinating process of organic adaptation as the marketplace explores new models.  Many content owners, at first concerned by the ease with which their content can be copied, are learning to benefit from this same activity.  Others are willingly embracing free and open source software licenses, Creative Commons licenses, and open content publishing models that use existing laws as a means to encourage reuse of the fruits of their labors rather than to tax or discourage such use.  The result is a creative ferment of collaboration, innovation, advancement and opportunity for all concerned.</p>
			<p>If this exploration is too tightly restricted by new laws, or if courts too strictly apply old laws, this process could be inhibited, or, worse yet, brought to a halt entirely.  That would be a great tragedy, as the Internet has already proven itself capable of providing an unparalleled vehicle for sharing knowledge, creativity and opportunity.</p>
			<p>Disruptive technologies, by definition, stir the pot, upsetting the status quo and applying stress in areas where all may have seemed in balance.  Until things once again settle down, that stress may be extremely unwelcome and painful.   But attempts at putting the genie back in the bottle are rarely successful.  Moreover, the wishes that are within the power of the same genie to grant can be lost as well.</p>
			<p>Clearly, the Internet has much more to deliver that we have yet to experience, or perhaps even guess.  Where it will take us can hardly be presumed after so few years of wide use.  With so much promise, it is certainly too early to set the promise of the future in the concrete of comprehensive laws enacted today.  Indeed, it may be that if traditional content owners press too hard to protect their traditional rights rather than join in the creative exploration of this far larger stage, they may lose the most of all.</p>

			<h3>Introducing the Hague Declaration</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<h6>Date: May 13, 2008<br /><span class="views">Views: 2,048</span></h6>
			<img class="imgright" src="apr08/apr_img1.jpg" alt="" width="63" height="63" border="0" />		
			<p>When one thinks of international human rights, one thinks of The Hague &mdash; home of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, and the situs of an increasing number of Tribunals chartered to redress the assaults on human dignity that inexcusably continue to plague <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/index.php?topic=20060806114016845">this planet</a>. It is therefore appropriate that The Hague has been chosen to witness yet another announcement in defense of human rights. That pronouncement has been titled <a href="http://www.digistan.org/hague-declaration:en">The Hague Declaration</a> by the new international group, called the <a href="http://www.digistan.org/">Digital Standards Organization</a> ("Digistan," for short), that crafted it. In this blog entry, I'll talk about what the Declaration is all about, and what it is intended to achieve.</p>
			<p>The basic premise is that as more and more of our basic freedoms (speech, assembly, interaction with government, and so on) move from the real to the virtual world, care must be taken to ensure that our ability to exercise these freedoms is not inadvertently eroded or lost.  On the opportunity side, the Internet and the Web provide incredible and unique ways to bring the benefits heretofore enjoyed only in developed countries to those struggling for equality of opportunity in emerging countries.</p>
			<p>But our freedoms can only be preserved, and theses benefits can only be extended, to the extent that everyone has affordable, unrestricted access to the Internet.  Just as we should be free to choose our newspapers, radio stations and political parties, we should be able to choose how we log on to the Internet, and the tools we use to interact there.  For the less advantaged, this should be achievable at the lowest possible cost.</p>
			<p>In order to achieve this end at the technical level, we need the type of free and open digital standards that can ensure adoption in many different competing products, prevent vendor capture, and enable implementation in free and open source software as well as proprietary products.  If we are successful in creating such standards and achieving their ubiquitous adoption, then we can assure lowest cost solutions and the greatest breadth of choice.  And we can also thereby help preserve what I have previously called our "Digital Information and Communication (ICT) Rights."   These are issues that I've written on frequently of late, most thoroughly in <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb08.php">this issue</a> of <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/archive.php">Standards Today</a>.</p>
			<p>The Declaration expresses these goals this way:</p>
			<blockquote>Considering that all countries are moving, at different rates and from different starting points, towards a society in which full and effective participation in government and society, and access to public services, education and opportunity, are increasingly dependent upon access to electronic communications;</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Considering more specifically that:</blockquote>
			<ol>
				<li>Government information, services and resources are increasingly provided virtually rather than physically;<br /><br /></li>
				<li>Freedom of speech and association are increasingly exercised on line rather than in person;<br /><br /></li>
				<li>The Internet and the Web provide an unprecedented avenue to equality of education and opportunity for all peoples throughout the world;</li>
			</ol>
			<blockquote>Considering that the benefits of the Internet may only be guaranteed, and our hard-won human rights may only be preserved as we make the transition to a digital society, by ensuring affordable, equal access to the Internet, and if the openness of the Internet is also preserved;</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Considering the unique role that free and open digital standards can play in ensuring this result by fostering competition and innovation, lowering costs and increasing choice;</blockquote>
			<p>Because governments have the authority to protect human rights and the moral obligation to promote equal economic and educational opportunities, the Declaration also recognizes the need for governments to recognize and support free and open standards.  As a result, the Declaration concludes as follows:</p>
			<p>We call on all governments to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbers">Procure only information technology that implements free and open standards;<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Deliver e-government services based exclusively on free and open standards;<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Use only free and open digital standards in their own activities.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I personally believe that The Hague Declaration is an important statement that articulates essential values and goals in a way that is easily understood.  My hope, and that of the other founders of Digistan, is that it will be useful in helping both citizens and legislators understand something that many have already sensed, but might not have been able to find the right words to wrap around their concerns.</p>
			<p>It is difficult to advocate for something that is difficult to describe.   With this Declaration, I believe that we have found the words we need to recognize and protect something that has been hard won, and is too precious to lose through inadvertence: our basic human rights, as expressed and exercised in the virtual world.</p>
			<p>I'd encourage you to read the full Declaration (the text also appears at the end of this blog entry).  If you agree with what you read, please consider <a href="http://www.digistan.org/hague-declaration:en">adding your name</a> to the growing list of signatures (the Declaration was posted publicly just a few hours ago at the Digistan site). <em>[As of May 29, a total 1963 individuals have signed the Declaration]</em></p>
			<p>The Hague Declaration will be officially issued on May 21 in The Hague at a workshop to be held by Digistan.  That meeting (like Digistan) is open to all, and you can read more about it <a href="http://www.digistan.org/register:2008-05-21-hague">here</a>.</p>
			<p>In my next blog entry, I'll tell you about Digistan itself &mdash; and how you can become involved.</p>

			<h3>The Hague Declaration</h3>
			<h5 class="center">Adopted and proclaimed<br />by the founders of the Digital Standards Organization<br />in The Hague on 21 May 2008.</h5>
			<p>Whereas almost 60 years ago the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, established in international law these rights and freedoms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbers">Freedom from discrimination by government or law (Article 2, Article 7).<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Freedom of movement within the borders of each state (Article 13.1).<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">The right to participate in government (Article 21.1).<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">The right of equal access to public services (Article 21.2).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whereas these rights and freedoms are today accepted by every democratic government and <a href="http://www.digistan.org/legal-basis">backed by the constitutions</a> of most states;</p>
			<p>Considering that all countries are moving, at different rates and from different starting points, towards a society in which full and effective participation in government and society, and access to public services, education and opportunity, are increasingly dependent upon access to electronic communications;</p>
			<p>Considering more specifically that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Government information, services and resources are increasingly provided virtually rather than physically;<br /><br /></li>
				<li>Freedom of speech and association are increasingly exercised on line rather than in person;<br /><br /></li>
				<li>The Internet and the Web provide an unprecedented avenue to equality of education and opportunity for all peoples throughout the world;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Considering that the benefits of the Internet may only be guaranteed, and our hard-won human rights may only be preserved as we make the transition to a digital society, by ensuring affordable, equal access to the Internet, and if the openness of the Internet is also preserved;</p>
			<p>Considering the unique role that free and open digital standards can play in ensuring this result by fostering competition and innovation, lowering costs and increasing choice;</p>
			<p>Considering that governments, through example and procurement, are uniquely able to ensure that all people achieve the benefits that free and open digital standards can provide;</p>
			<p>Considering that these benefits are of particular importance to the economically, socially, and geographically disadvantaged peoples of the world;</p>
			<p>Considering that <a href="http://www.digistan.org/open-standard">there is increasing consensus</a> on the attributes of a free and open digital standard;</p>
			<p>We call on all governments to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbers">Procure only information technology that implements free and open standards;<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Deliver e-government services based exclusively on free and open standards;<br /><br /></li>

			<h3><span class="red">#54</span> All Standards are Created Equal<br />(but some are more equal than others)</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>Standards are rather authoritarian creatures, gaining their value by bullying their way around the physical or virtual landscape, telling every other part of a design what it has to do, and sometimes even how. Just about everything in the world must kowtow before their insistence, whether it be a wine bottle conforming its shape to match the provenance of its contents, a light bulb limiting its appetite to a specified amount of power, or a WiFi chip petitioning a router for attention.</p>
			<p>In a sense, such subservience is counter intuitive. Why would one company want to give up its freedom to design its products as it wishes, and (worse yet) agree to do something the same way as its competitor, thereby decreasing the distinctiveness of its own products? The answer, of course, is that the same company expects to gain more than it gives up when it agrees to cede a few parameters to a standard, while remaining free to differentiate its offerings in all other ways.</p>
			<p>The result is an army of fascistic specifications that rules much of just about every discipline, from product design to professional certification to ensuring our safety and health. Most often, the power of these requirements derives simply from market forces, rather than any underlying force of law. We should all be so powerful, but rarely find ourselves so, even in our own homes.</p>
			<p>Thus it may come as some small comfort that there are standards, and then there are, well <em>Standards</em>. Put another way, there is a pecking order among some types of standards, just as there seems to be in just about everything else in life. The fact is, some standards enjoy more clout than others.</p>
			<p>How can that be? After all, if standards have value only to the extent that they are unassailable, how can one be "more assailable" than another?</p>
			<p>The answer is actually rather simple. Consider, for example, what the following common objects have in common:</p>
			<p class="center"><em>A 4' X 8' sheet of plywood</em></p>
			<p class="center"><em>A cargo container</em></p>
			<p class="center"><em>The distance traveled by light in an absolute vacuum<br />in 1&frasl;299,792,458 of a second</em></p>
			<p class="center"><em>A 45 RPM single record (assuming you're old enough to<br />know what I'm talking about)</em></p>
			<p>Got it? No? The answer is that each is an example of what I'll call an "Alpha Standard."</p>
			<p>What makes a plain, ordinary, garden variety standard an Alpha Standard? In fact, the answer to that question is often "nothing," other than the fact that many standards are derivative, or based upon, other standards to some extent, and you need to start somewhere. Sometimes that "somewhere" has an empirical reason for being what it is or has historical antecedents that lend logic to the selection. But in others, the choice can simply suit the whim of the person (or more likely committee, this being standards we're talking about) making the decision.</p>
			<p>Once the decision has been made, however, the standard at the hub of the wheel becomes more powerful with the addition of each new standards spoke. As this occurs, the Alpha Standard becomes more entrenched, and the marketplace becomes increasingly locked in through the adoption of the spider like webs of related standards that grow up around the might Alpha Standard at the center.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at each one of the examples noted to see how this dynamic takes shape:</p>
			<p><strong><em>Plywood:</em></strong> Why 4 X 8? For starters, it's a size that's manageable to carry, but large enough to fill up a large space quickly with a minimum number of sheets. It's also about the right size, when placed on edge, to sheathe one story of a building. We'll also pause to note that both its width and length are a multiple of the same number &mdash; 2. But let's stop there and just say "why not," and focus instead on the influence that these gross dimensions have on design.</p>
			<p>The first thing that we'll notice is that the less unique a building may be, the more likely it will be to have as many of its overall dimensions, as well as internal room sizes, expressed in multiples of 2 feet. If the building in question is a prefabricated house or one of hundreds of "tract houses" built to a limited number of designs in the same development, you'll be surprised how true to form this observation will be. The reason of course is that each is built to the lowest price possible, which means that the designer wants it to be built in the smallest amount of time possible, and with the least wastage of materials.</p>
			<p>Obviously, the more you can lay that plywood down and nail it without cutting it off at the edges, the better you'll do on both scores. As a result, simply changing from the traditional practice of using planks to sheath walls and nailing slate to lathe applied to rafters to finish off a roof resulted in housing becoming more uniform in shape and dimensions.</p>
			<p>So now we have the dimensions of house, and as many of the rooms as possible, fixed. What next? Well, obviously we'll want all other sheet materials to be the same dimensions, whether we're talking about sheetrock or faux wood paneling for the interior walls, foam panels for the drop ceilings, or flakeboard for the floors. And let's also think about the size of that tile, and the width of that roll of linoleum as well. They all cost money and take time to cut as well. And so it goes, until changing the dimensions of a stock sheet of plywood is about as likely to happen in our lifetimes as George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld are to share the Nobel Peace Prize in theirs.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Cargo containers:</em></strong> While the dimensions of a sheet of plywood have helped reshape our houses, cargo containers have literally reshaped the global transportation of goods. In this case, the dimensions of the box approximate the requirements of two pre-existing elements: rail cars and the trailers attached to the cabs of 18 wheel tractor trailer rigs (articulated lorries, to those on the other side of the pond). Once these dimensions had been fixed (at 20 feet in length, 8 in width, and 8 1/2 in height) and "containerization" caught on, every other element of the end to end process of shipping conformed itself to those dimensions &mdash; including other standards.</p>
			<p>Even standards that had given long and useful lives of service were callously felled by this nouveau Alpha Standard upstart. Let us therefore pause to remember the faithful and timeless ton, now put to pasture in much of global commerce by the TEU, a new kid on the block with an acronymic name deriving from "20 foot [container] Equivalent Unit." And this is just the tip of the iceberg (for the rest of the ice, consult an earlier Consider This piece, titled <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/blog.php?ID=39">Thinking About Standards Inside of the Box</a>, occasioned by the 50th anniversary of the Birth of the Box).</p>
			<p><strong><em>Light:</em></strong> MIT and Stanford graduates will, of course, have immediately recognized this as the internationally recognized method of establishing the basic unit of length in the metric system: the metre (or meter, on <em>this</em> side of the pond). But this method is not the original formulation for determining the exact length of this Alpha Standard. That honor belongs to a 90% platinum, 10% iridium bar upon which were etched marks at a distance established at a conference titled, appropriately enough, the Convention du M&egrave;tre. A limited number of "prototype metre" bars were later fabricated for distribution to appropriate repositories around the world for reference purposes. These reference bars were etched while stabilized in temperature at "the melting point of ice."</p>
			<p>But how was the distance between those two marks determined? To answer this, one must know that it was the French government that first adopted a metric system, and not a Royalist government, but a Republican government, in 1799. The distance selected to serve as the determinant of the metre was therefore intended to approximate, in true rationalist fashion, 1 millionth of the length of an imaginary line drawn between the North Pole and the equator, passing through (of course) Paris. Once that distance had been determined to the greatest precision enabled by the science and mechanical means of the times, the exact length of the meter could be assigned, a new Alpha Standard sprang into being, from which all other decimalar extensions, both great and small, could be derived.</p>
			<p>Still, even platinum-iridium bars can become tarnished, and they do insist on expanding and contracting. As early as 1893, almost before the new prototype bars had settled in to their new homes, efforts commenced to find some invariable natural phenomenon that could serve as a reference point. Not until 1960, however, was such a natural measure agreed upon, with the laurel wreath being awarded to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom (yes, of course, in a vacuum!)</p>
			<p>Well done! But not, of course, well done enough. Why, after all, settle for less than the ultimate invariable, as discovered by Albert Einstein in his own relativistic way? Why not base the metre <em>upon the very speed of light itself?</em> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre">Wikipedia entry</a> for the metre provides the last bit of explanatory precision on how this was conceived as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>Note that this definition had the effect of fixing the speed of light in a vacuum at precisely 299,792,458 metres per second. Although the metre is now <em>defined</em> in terms of time-of-flight, actual laboratory realizations of the metre are still <em>delineated</em> by counting the required number of wavelengths of light along the distance. An intended byproduct of the 17th CGPM's definition was that it enabled scientists to measure the wavelength of their lasers with one-fifth the uncertainty. To further facilitate reproducibility from lab to lab, the 17th CGPM also made the iodine-stabilised helium-neon laser "a recommended radiation" for realising the metre. For purposes of delineating the metre, the BIPM currently considers the HeNe laser wavelength to be as follows: &lambda;HeNe = 632.99139822 nm with an estimated relative standard uncertainty (U) of 2.5 x 10<sup>&ndash;11</sup>.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> This uncertainty is currently the limiting factor in laboratory realisations of the metre as it is several orders of magnitude poorer than that of the second (U = 5 x 10<sup>&ndash;16</sup>).<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup> Consequently, a practical realisation of the metre is usually delineated (not defined) today in labs as 1,579,800.298728(39) wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in a vacuum.</blockquote>
			<p>Pretty impressive stuff, huh? Query, though, whether something may not be missing from this picture of precision, for while the speed of light is absolute, the passage of time is relative. Should our determination of the metre not therefore take place at sea level, given that time passes more slowly at altitude?</p>
			<p>Be that as it may, the Mighty Metre, however established, remains the Alpha Standard of length, and the mother of all measurements from here to there, a living legacy of the Age of Reason.</p>
			<p><strong><em>45s:</em></strong> Once upon a time, few bedrooms inhabited by teenage girls lacked a cheap portable "record player," next to which would sit a stack of 7" diameter vinyl "records," each in a paper sleeve, and upon which two songs had been recorded, one on the "A" side and one on the other, or (yes, that's right) "B" side (these were not very imaginative times). These records were also referred to as "singles," to distinguish them from the larger vinyl records, called "albums," "LPs" (for "long play," comparatively speaking), and sometimes "33s" (because they spun at 33 1/3 revolutions per minute on the "turntable" found within the "record player" (45's spun at a faster speed &mdash; 45 RPMs, and hence the name). Are those of you under 45 (that's age, now) still with me?</p>
			<p>Singles could be about three minutes long, because that's about what a 45 could hold under then-available technology. Each 45 (on its A side) held a song that a band or performer hoped DJs would play on the radio, thereby creating demand primarily for the more profitable albums. Albums played for about 45 minutes to an hour, and were made up of singles, B side tracks, and previously unreleased material.</p>
			<p>With that as background for those not alive during prehistory, we can now get back into the Alpha Standard business.</p>
			<p>The first and foremost impact of the 45 RPM vinyl format was the enshrinement of the Three Minute Single Standard, the moral authority of which might best be illustrated by paraphrasing the introduction to the Killer Rabbit vignette in Spamalot:</p>
			<blockquote><strong><em>Station Owner</em></strong> (Examining the first new 45 single, turning it over in his hands.) Why is it....Why is it this size?<br />
			<strong><em>DJ:</em></strong> I know not, boss.<br />
			<strong><em>Station Owner:</em></strong> Consult the book of Payola!<br />
			(Record Agent steps in)<br />
			<strong><em>DJ:</em></strong> Payola Chapter One, verses nine through twenty-seven:<br />
			<strong><em>Record Agent:</em></strong> And Saint Phillip Spector raised the 45 up on high saying, "Oh RCA, Bless us this Single, and with its Wall of Sound smash my competitors in MoTown to tiny bits."<br />
			And the Chairman of RCA did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs, and stoats, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and lima bean-<br />
			<strong><em>DJ:</em></strong> Skip a bit, brother.<br />
			<strong><em>Record Agent:</em></strong> And then did David Sarnoff spake, saying: "First, shalt thou place a plastic spider on thy 33 spindle.<br />
			Then shalt thou place upon it and record a single, which shall be three minutes in length. No more, no less.<br />
			*Three* shall be the length of the single, and the length of the single shall be three.<br />
			*Four* shalt thou not record, and neither record thou two, excepting that thou then goest on to three.<br />
			Five is RIGHT OUT.<br />
			Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou the single at the record stations of the land, who, being in my pay, shall play it. Amen.<br />
			<strong><em>All:</em></strong> Amen.<br />
			<strong><em>DJ:</em></strong> Right! (finally gets to put single on turntable)<br /></blockquote>
			<p>All right, maybe that's a bit over the top. But suffice it to say that for years, singles were required to be within seconds of three minutes in length in order to make it on the air. For years, the reality of popular music, whether A side, B side, or other, conformed to this norm until the musicians of the late 'Sixties began to rebel against the three minute single standard (just as they, and their listeners, did everything else), at least on albums. The final act of rebellion was committed by the Beatles, who finally broke the three minute standard rule decisively with the release of their hit "Hey Jude" in August of 1968. As if to rub it in, a good portion of the over 7 minutes of air play is a repetition of that most timeless of all derisive sentiments, "Na, na na, na-na-na-na."</p>
			<p>All of which, to be sure, does not in the least disprove the existence of Alpha Standards. Why? Because as everyone knows (or at least those old enough to remembers 45s), the Beatles in their prime provided the Alpha Standard by which all else was judged.</p>
