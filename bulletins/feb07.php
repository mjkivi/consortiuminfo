                  <p align="center" class="style10"><strong>THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP OF GOVERNMENT TO STANDARDS</strong></p>
                  <p align="center" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Over the past several years,  I have found myself returning repeatedly to the role (or, more properly, the  many roles) that governments play in standardization.&nbsp; Recent issues with government themes include <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/aug05.php">Government and SSOs:  Optimizing the System</a> (August 2005), <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php">Massachusetts and  OpenDocument: the Commonwealth Leads the Way</a> (September 2005), <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/oct05.php">Standards for a Small  Planet</a> (October 2005), <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov05.php">WSIS and the  Governance of the Internet</a> (November 2005), and <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep06.php">Standards and Human  Rights</a> (September 2006).&nbsp; Stories in  other issues along the way have explored related themes.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">That's not surprising,  because private-sector standard-setting is a quasi-governmental process in its  own right.&nbsp; Moreover, there are many  interdependencies between the private and public sectors when it comes to  standards: governments set standards (in laws and regulations); they adopt  private sector standards (by referencing them in laws and regulations); they  participate directly in standard setting when they join standards organizations  as members; and they influence standards through procurement, to highlight only the more  obvious examples.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This public-private  partnership has been extremely productive for all concerned, allowing standards  to be set by those parties that have a direct interest in their specifics (thus  saving government from the burden of creating the standards themselves), while  still allowing governments to vet and utilize the results when they wish.&nbsp; But in the United States, which supports a  &quot;bottom up&quot; standard setting philosophy, the relationship between  government and the private sector is much  looser and ad hoc than is the  case in many other countries.&nbsp; The  result is that the U.S. federal government maintains a more detached, and  less informed, relationship to standards than is often the case abroad.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In this issue, I focus on an  area in which I believe governments should  take renewed interest: the role  of information and communications technology (ICT) standards in modern  society.&nbsp; With our increased reliance on  the Internet and the Web and the digitization of public records, the need for a  citizen to have full access to ICT at home and in the workplace has become  fundamental.&nbsp; In consequence, I believe  it is incumbent upon governments to reevaluate the roles they play in relation  to standard setting in ICT domains.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">I begin this exploration in  my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>, focusing on &quot;accessibility standards,&quot;  broadly construed &ndash; highlighting the role of standards domestically in areas  such as IT accessibility for those with disabilities, and internationally at  the level of domain names and broadband access.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">I continue this theme in  this month's <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong>, in which I review the various ways  that governments interact with standards and standard setting, examine how  various roles might best apply in the case of accessibility standards, and  finally make  recommendations on how governments could best evolve their  relationship to ICT standards going forward.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Next up is an <strong><em>Update</em></strong> on the long-running prosecution of semiconductor design firm Rambus, Inc. by  the Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp; The FTC's  decision to sanction Rambus highlights the traditional and ongoing role of  government as the ultimate (and perhaps too occasional) guarantor against abuse  of the standard setting process.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This month I've decided to  include two related entries from the <strong><em>Standards Blog </em></strong>rather than  one, as each relates to an accelerating trend among governments to mandate the  use of &quot;open document formats&quot; to preserve public records.&nbsp; Four U.S. States now either already specify  (Massachusetts) that their employees create and save documents in such  standards-based formats, or have current legislation in process that, if  adopted, would require such action (Minnesota, Texas and California).&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, I turn to a different type of accessibility  standard in my <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> piece for this  month.&nbsp; That standard assigns a  simple three-letter code to each language in existence (and to many that are  now extinct).&nbsp; This humble and  little-noticed standard, like the Unicode, helps ensure that all peoples of the  world will be able to access the Internet.&nbsp;  You may be surprised how the standard came into being, and the nature of  the organization that has taken responsibility for keeping it current.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">I'm certain that this won't  be the last issue that I dedicate to the relationship between government and standards, and I  look forward to continuing to share my thoughts with you in the future on this important  topic.&nbsp; Perhaps you will find the time  to share a few of your thoughts with me as well.</p>
                  <div align="left" class="style2">As  always, I hope you enjoy this issue.&nbsp;</div>

              <p align="left" class="style2">To date,  however, the provision and usage of information and communications technologies  (ICT) are largely unregulated at the technical level, despite the increasingly  profound impact that ICT has on our lives.&nbsp;  True, the communications side of the equation continues to be subject to  significant government control.&nbsp; Radio,  television, and a rapidly increasing range of wireless frequencies are the  subject of treaties internationally, while the allocation, sale and usage of  the bandwidth thus defined remains the province of national regulation.&nbsp; In the United States, Congress occasionally  passes a law to accomplish a particular data-related purpose, such as  preventing the unauthorized sale of consumer information.&nbsp; But most aspects of the modern networked world  are controlled primarily by commercial forces, and to the extent that they are  regulated on a <em>de facto</em> basis, it is through the adoption and use of  consensus (and sometimes proprietary) standards.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This  relative lack of regulation is attributable in part to the decreasing intervals  between technology revolutions that typify the world of ICT today.&nbsp; Regulation is a ponderous process that  usually begins with perceived pain at the voter or industry level, which is  then made known to legislators through the ballot box and the lobbyist.&nbsp; Only with time do those that make the laws  and regulations become engaged, educated, and eventually active, since  government is far more likely to be reactive than proactive.&nbsp; Similarly, regulators must perceive a  problem and investigate it before they can act in the individual case &ndash; at  which point the lengthy process of litigation begins.&nbsp; Small wonder, then, that legislators have little appetite to  regulate what may  have ceased to be relevant by the time the regulations are complete.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As a  result, allowing ICT deployment to romp ahead of regulation in an unconstrained  fashion may in fact be the right as well as the inevitable course of  (in)action.&nbsp; But a creeping sense of unease  can arise when one considers that more and more of the reality of modern life  plays out across the Internet and the Web.&nbsp;  Is security adequate to protect privacy and prevent identity theft?&nbsp; Could the cyberinfrastructure withstand a  determined assault, not by hackers, but by an enemy government?&nbsp; Has adequate attention been given to whether  those with disabilities can exist in a Web-based economy? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">These  are hardly trivial questions, as more and more critical activities redeploy to  the Internet. To give but a few examples, national and global financial  infrastructures, first responder networks, national defense telecommunications,  government services, and the healthcare system are all becoming ever more  dependent upon ICT platforms forming national, and often international  networks.&nbsp; These platforms are evolving  rapidly and organically largely in response to market forces, without guidance  from, and subject to few constraints imposed by, governments in the free world.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As our  dependency on ICT increases exponentially, it therefore makes sense to ask  whether the continuation of this laissez-faire atmosphere will remain (even) on  balance a good thing.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">At the  highest level, that question might be answered in one of three ways:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The  first would be to conclude that we should apply the theory and practice of  historical regulation to evolving ICT realities in as consistent a manner as  possible.&nbsp; But the old wine often pours  poorly into these new bottles.&nbsp;  Established notions regarding copyrights, for example, are being  challenged by consumers that want to link, mash up and share Web-based content  that is effortlessly accessed and difficult to copy protect.&nbsp; Intriguingly, many  major companies in the equally established (and  challenged) industries that produce and own this content are scrambling  to t hink up ways  to make money on freely distributed content. This  process already muted the calls for reform, and may ultimately moot the need for new  laws and regulations entirely.&nbsp; On the  other hand, a court has recently concluded that a major retailer (Target  Corporation) should be required to make its Website as accessible to its  customers as its stores.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Another  option would be to decide that we should go to the opposite extreme, and  declare the Internet, the Web, and everything that relies upon them to be  unique, demanding new approaches and novel solutions.&nbsp; Or, less radically, modern ICT could be viewed as a fresh slate  upon which new regulatory formulae, as fresh as the opportunities that these  technologies offer, could be written, free of the obligation to apply old rules  in rote fashion.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But  success has been mixed with this approach as well, as demonstrated by the  history to date of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,  more often referred to simply as ICANN.&nbsp;  ICANN was created as a brand new quasi-public entity in 1998 to maintain  the root directories of the Internet, although it is common knowledge that the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) views itself  as the natural and  rightful custodian of these basis resources.&nbsp;  The bypassing of the ITU was accomplished through the efforts of those  who were loath to entrust the root directories to the venerable (and  bureaucratic) ITU, despite the fact that it is a treaty organization in which  governments work together under the aegis of the United Nations.&nbsp; But despite this fresh approach, ICANN has  been regularly criticized on a number of fronts, and remains controversial  today, due in large part to the continuing influence that the United States (as  the original developer of the Internet) has reserved for itself over ICANN.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The  third high-level option would be for government to continue to largely stand  aside, allowing commercial interests to play the greatest role in defining our  ICT future.&nbsp; But already,  as the recent controversy over so-called &quot;Internet Neutrality&quot; has  demonstrated, government may find itself dragged into the debate over ICT  whether it wishes to stand aside or not.&nbsp;  And at other times where similar intervention may be sorely needed, less  organized stakeholders, such as consumers, and less powerful polities, such as  third world populations, will  likely have  a hard time making their voices heard.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Thus it seems  that there is no clear answer to the question of what role governments &ndash; and,  for that matter, what role <em>which</em> governments &ndash; should play in regulating  ICT.&nbsp; During the pioneer period of the  Internet and the Web, one could make a strong case that government has played  the most important role it could by simply staying out of the way.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But now  that the paradigm has shifted, and everything that was based upon tangible  media has become virtual, it may be time to reexamine the balance between  unregulated innovation and the provision of essential services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, before things reach a crisis point  that leads to overreaction and over regulation, someone needs to consider those  big issues that are of a type that government has addressed in the past.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Many of  those issues in ICT can conveniently be grouped under the concept of  accessibility.&nbsp; Will those with  disabilities have equal access to Internet based information and services?&nbsp; Will public records be accessible to all  over the long term, regardless of changes in proprietary technology?&nbsp; Will individual patient records be  accessible, on an appropriate, privacy-protected, basis to those doctors and  others that need to review them, regardless of where they work?&nbsp; And will access to identity information only  be granted to those who have a valid reason to gain it?<br>
                  <br>
                  It may  not be appropriate to argue that it is urgent at this time to reconsider the  role of government in the regulation of ICT, although it is unquestionably  timely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of timing, one thing  can be assumed with certainty:&nbsp; if  private industry does not satisfactorily address the issues identified above,  then sooner or later, voters and special interest groups will demand that  Congress do the job instead of industry.&nbsp; When  that happens, it is unlikely that the legislative approach will be fresh or  innovative.&nbsp; In many cases, this may  serve the public weal quite well.&nbsp; But  in others, more nimble and flexible solutions, devised and deployed by those  most intimately involved at the market and the technical levels, might be of  far better benefit to all.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">That's  something that everyone involved in developing and deploying technology might  take the time to consider. It would be  especially worthwhile for those that are involved in the  consensus based ICT standards organizations that have the power to place us on  prudent paths of self-regulation to do so as we move forward into the future.</p>

                <div align="center"><span class="style10">FTC CAPS RAMBUS ROYALTIES                </span>                </div>
               
                <p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style2">The Federal Trade Commission announced on  February 5, 2007 that it had at last delivered a penalty ruling in its long-running  prosecution of memory technology company Rambus, Inc.&nbsp; The full Board of Commissioners had earlier found, on appeal from  a holding in favor or Rambus by an FTC Administrative Law Judge in 2004, that  Rambus had illegally created a monopoly in certain standards-reliant technology by abusing the  JEDEC standard setting process in the early 1990s.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  That opinion was handed down in August of  2006, at which time the Commissions announced that they would hold further  hearings with FTC Complaint Counsel and Rambus, and would welcome industry  input regarding what penalties would be appropriate to levy against  Rambus.&nbsp; Several industry groups and I filed amicus briefs in  response.&nbsp; My <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/RambusFTC2006AmicusBrief.pdf">own brief</a> urged the FTC to  include a punitive element, in order to emphasize that abuse of the standard  setting process would result in dire results.&nbsp; Most obviously, such an  element could bar Rambus from charging any royalties at all from those that  wished to implement the standard at issue.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The stakes were high for Rambus while  awaiting the Commissioners' decision, since that decision could influence the  outcome and damages assessed in the multiple private cases that are ongoing  between Rambus and the various semiconductor companies that have refused to pay  royalties to Rambus.&nbsp; These royalties relate to patents that the FTC had  already held were illegally hidden by Rambus from the working group members in  JEDEC  created the SDRAM standard at issue.&nbsp; At least one judge  had already delayed further action in one of these cases, in order to learn  what penalty the FTC might conclude would be appropriate under the  circumstances.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  For the standards community, the FTC's  anticipated judgment would also be significant, because if Rambus were to be  let off lightly, gaming the standards system could appear to offer better  business returns than playing by the rules.&nbsp; Such a perception could tempt  other companies to try the same gambit, and also lessen participation in  standard setting overall.&nbsp;Clearly, if there is more to lose than to gain  by helping create, and then adopt, a standard, then standards development could  become a process in which only the unaware &ndash; and those that wished to prey upon  them &ndash; would participate.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  In fact, the FTC had substantial latitude  in arriving at its decision.&nbsp; As noted  by the Commission in the majority opinion announced on February 5, the Supreme  Court has previously:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">&hellip;emphasized the  Commission&rsquo;s wide discretion in its choice of remedy, and stated the  expectation that the Commission would &lsquo;exercise a special competence in formulating  remedies to deal with problems in the general sphere of competitive  practices&rsquo;&hellip;.[Thus, the Commission] enjoys &lsquo;wide latitude for judgment&rsquo; in  fashioning a remedial order, subject to the constraint that the requirements of  the order bear a reasonable relationship to the unlawful practices that the  Commission has found.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  In a somewhat similar case, Dell Computer  acquiesced in 1996 to an FTC consent decree, under which it surrendered any right to require payment of  royalties by  implementers of a  VESA standard.&nbsp; Like Rambus, Dell had been accused of failing to disclose  a patent during a VESA standards development process, and then later asserting  that patent against implementers of the same standard.&nbsp; Dell was also  required to subject itself to oversight in its standards-related activities for  a period of ten years.&nbsp; Most obviously,  then, the FTC could decide to limit the royalties that Rambus could charge to  implement the SDRAM standard, or to bar Rambus from charging any royalties at  all.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">In the event, the FTC opted to require  Rambus to license its essential patent claims (something that Rambus was  already doing), to limit the amount of royalties that Rambus could charge, and  to bar it from charging any royalties at all after three years.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  In order to determine the amount of  royalties Rambus would be permitted to charge, the Commissioners attempted to  determine what licensing terms would have prevailed had Rambus disclosed its  patents in timely fashion.&nbsp; Or, as stated in the FTC press release,  quoting the majority opinion:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">&ldquo;Having found  liability, we want a remedy strong enough to restore ongoing competition and  thereby to inspire confidence in the standard-setting process. At the same  time, we do not want to impose an unnecessarily restrictive remedy that could  undermine the attainment of pro-competitive goals,&rdquo; it says.</p>
                  <p class="style2">&ldquo;[T]he Commission  has previously declared, and we agree, that &lsquo;where the circumstances justify  such relief, the Commission has the authority to require royalty-free licensing.&rsquo;  . . . We conclude, however, that Complaint Counsel have not satisfied their  burden of demonstrating that a royalty-free remedy is necessary to restore the  competition that would have existed in the &lsquo;but for&rsquo; world &ndash; i.e., that absent  Rambus&rsquo;s deception, JEDEC would not have standardized Rambus technologies, thus  leaving Rambus with no royalties. . . .We have examined the record for the  proof that the courts have found necessary to impose royalty-free licensing,  but do not find it. &rdquo;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  But how, exactly, does a court determine  how to take the marketplace back in time, and predict how it would have  behaved, based only upon assumptions derived from the evidence provided by each  side?&nbsp; The press release continues as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">&ldquo;We therefore are  left with the task of determining the maximum reasonable royalty rate that  Rambus may charge those practicing the SDRAM and DDR-SDRAM standards. Royalty  rates unquestionably are better set in the marketplace, but Rambus&rsquo;s deceptive  conduct has made that impossible. Although we do not relish imposing a  compulsory licensing remedy, the facts presented make that relief appropriate  and indeed necessary to restore competition,&rdquo; the opinion states. </p>
                  <p class="style2">&ldquo;[W]e find that a  maximum royalty rate of .5% for DDR SDRAM, for three years from the date the  Commission&rsquo;s Order is issued and then going to zero, is reasonable and  appropriate. We also find that a corresponding .25% maximum rate for SDRAM is  appropriate. Halving the DDR SDRAM rate reflects the fact that SDRAM utilizes  only two of the relevant Rambus technologies, whereas DDR SDRAM uses four.&rdquo;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  Significantly, the order also prohibits  Rambus from charging more than these rates on any outstanding license  agreement.&nbsp; This element of the order would seem to automatically diminish  the damages that Rambus could be awarded in any ongoing litigation based upon  alleged infringement of the patents in question.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The Commissioners also imposed an  oversight condition that echoes the intent, but does not replicate the  specifics, of the Dell consent decree.&nbsp; Under this section of Commission's  order, Rambus must in the future not only make complete disclosure of all  relevant patents when and as required by the rules of any standard setting  organization in which it participates, but it must &quot;employ a  Commission-approved compliance officer to ensure disclosure of intellectual  property rights to standard-setting organizations and to verify the accuracy of  Rambus&rsquo;s periodic reports to the Commission,&quot; as well as keep records of  its participation that can be audited by the Commission to monitor Rambus'  compliance with the order.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Unlike the decision this summer, which  was unanimous, the new opinion was supported by only three out of the five  Commissioners (Commissioners Pamela Jones Harbour and J. Thomas Rosch concurred  in part and dissented in part; each also issued a separate opinion).</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Those looking to future holdings by the  FTC should note well that both of the dissenting Commissioners would have  imposed more stringent penalties than the majority.&nbsp; In his dissent,  Commissioner Rosch stated his belief that Rambus should have been barred from  receiving any royalties at all.&nbsp; To do otherwise, he stated, would enable  Rambus to &ldquo;continue to reap the fruits of its ongoing violation of Section  2.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioner Harbour reached the same result, observing &quot;I  also dissent [because] I do not believe the remedy adopted by the majority goes  far enough to restore competition.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">                  What happens next?&nbsp; Rambus has  announced that it will appeal the Commissioner's order, which otherwise would  take effect in 60 days time.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  Independent of any appeal by Rambus,  Monday's decision is not the final word in the broader context of its  liability.&nbsp; Judges in the ongoing litigation between Rambus and the memory  manufacturers may perhaps find the dissenting opinions of Commissioners Rosch  and Harbour to be more persuasive.&nbsp; And future standard setting  participants might find that odds of 3-2 do not appear attractive at all,  especially after the substantial costs of litigation already incurred by Rambus  are taken into account.</p>

              <p align="center" class="style10"><strong>MEANWHILE, DEEP DOWN IN TEXAS: 
AN OPEN FORMAT BILL IS FILED
</strong></p>
              <p align="center" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
              <div align="left" class="style56"><strong>February 06, 2007 </strong></div>
                <span class="style2">Views: 3,754</span>
                <p class="style2">                <span class="style2">Most of the attention this week relating to open document standards will focus on the responses ISO/IEC JTC 1 received regarding the Ecma 376/Microsoft OOXML submission during the "contradictions" phase of its Fast Track process, which ended on the February 5.  I 	just posted this entry on that topic, reporting that a total of twenty national bodies have filed contradictions or other comments as part of this phase of the process.</span></p>
                <p class="style2">But while this global drama has been  playing out, I've learned that a third US state will consider requiring use of  open document formats by government agencies (Massachusetts and Minnesota are  the other two to date).&nbsp; That state is Texas, where a bill has been  introduced to require that only &quot;open document formats&quot; should be  utilized by government agencies.&nbsp; The bill has been designated as SB 446, and was filed on  February 5 (the full text is reproduced at the end of this blog entry).</p>
                <p class="style2"> How does the Texas bill define an open  document format?&nbsp; As stated in the bill, such a format would need to be  based upon the Extensible Markup Language (more commonly referred to as XML),  would need to have been already adopted as a standard, and would be required to  meet the following additional criteria as well:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"> (1)&nbsp;  interoperable among diverse internal and external platforms and applications;<br>
  (2)&nbsp;  published without restrictions or royalties;<br>
  (3)&nbsp; fully  and independently implemented by multiple software providers on multiple&nbsp;  platforms without any intellectual property reservations for necessary  technology; and<br>
  (4)&nbsp;  controlled by an open industry organization with a well-defined inclusive  process for evolution of the standard.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2"> The language quoted is   problematic in some ways (how many platforms and applications does it take to  achieve diversity?&nbsp; Does &quot;without restriction&quot; mean without even  those restrictions that are deemed to be consistent with the most  &quot;open&quot; standards in use today, such as a license term providing for  defensive suspension upon assertion of infringement by a licensee?).&nbsp; That aside, the excerpt quotes above clearly  states the intention of the bill's proponents to exclude proprietary or overly  limited specifications.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2"> How would OOXML and ODF fare in Texas if  the bill is adopted as written?&nbsp; ODF  would appear to meet the test today, while OOXML would have difficulty with the  third requirement at minimum for some time &ndash; and perhaps forever, depending  upon whether &quot;fully and independently implemented&quot; means in an office  productivity suite in addition to Office 2007.&nbsp; It could also be debated  whether Ecma maintains an &quot;inclusive process,&quot; given the relatively  small size of its membership, and the fact that members at the highest level  must be approved before they can join.</p>
                <p class="style2"> The broad application of the proposed  legislation is also significant.&nbsp; If adopted in its current form, all  &quot;state agencies&quot; would be affected &ndash; cutting a very wide swathe  indeed.&nbsp; As defined, a state agency would include not only the state  offices that would be immediately apparent, but also  all attorneys that are  admitted to the State Bar, as well as  all state colleges and universities.&nbsp;  Local lawyers and law firms may not take kindly to a bill that requires them to  upgrade their IT infrastructure, and  it will be interesting to see  whether the Texas bar association takes a position on the bill, and perhaps  lobbies against at least this part of it.</p>
                <p class="style2"> Those  affected by the bill in its  final form (assuming it passes) would be required to create and save, as well as be able to  receive, documents  in approved open formats after the bill's effective date &ndash; December 1,  2007.&nbsp; Another section of the  bill would bar those affected from converting any open document into a format  &quot;used by a single vendor.&quot;&nbsp; The conversion of existing  documents into approved formats would not initially be mandated, but the Texas  Department of Information Resources (DIR) would be required to draft guidelines  by December 1, 2008 for performing such conversions, taking into account  considerations such as cost, document life, and need for public access.</p>
                <p class="style2"> It will be very interesting indeed to see  how this bill fares.&nbsp; On the plus side, the Texas DIR will be spared the  wrenching experience that the IT managers of Massachusetts suffered when they  sought to put such a policy in place on their own.&nbsp; Too, debate over the  bill will occur in public.&nbsp; But on the negative side, the legislators of  Texas may be surprised at the magnitude of effort that lobbyists on both sides  of the issue may expend &quot;educating&quot; them on the issues at hand.</p>
                <p class="style2"> It will also be interesting to see if  legislators in other states opt to file similar bills.&nbsp; One would assume  that the greater the number of states in which similar initiatives are  launched, the wider will be the public dialogue that will follow.&nbsp;  Hopefully, this will lead to a progressively more informed debate, and an  evolving consensus over the duties of government as regards public records.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  That's an important topic, and as a  result, I applaud the sponsors of this new bill, and look forward to the  debates that will follow.</p>
                <p class="style2"> And what about the Minnesota bill?&nbsp;  As you may recall, a Minnesota legislator filed a bill during the previous  legislative session that also included a <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060409175642741">bill-specific</a> definition of open standards that gave me some concern, because that definition  was not only <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060405064612853">quite  detailed</a> but also in many ways not  in line with traditional definitions of &quot;open standards.&quot;.&nbsp; Why was I concerned?&nbsp; Because if every  state&nbsp;legislates its own definition of what constitutes an &quot;open  standard,&quot; then there will be no &quot;standard&quot; definition of an  open standard.&nbsp; If that occurs, then how can vendors offer uniform  licensing terms for products intended to be sold on a national basis, and how  can standards organizations create intellectual property rights policies  intended to meet the needs of the marketplace?</p>
                <p class="style2"> Obviously, last year's Minnesota bill  highlighted the need for a consensus definition for an open standard.&nbsp;  This time around, the Minnesota proponents of open formats have filed a new and  shorter bill (on January 17 of this year), with a more concise definition of an  open standard.&nbsp; I am told that the bill enjoys&nbsp;broader support.&nbsp;  I've included the text of that draft bill after the California text, and you  can find it on line at the <a href="http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/bin/bldbill.php?bill=H0176.0.html&session=ls85">Minnesota  government Web site</a> as well.</p>

                <p><span class="style56">February 28, 2007</span><br>
                  <span class="style2">Views: 3,404</span></p>
                <p class="style2">The big news of the day is that a legislator in California has decided that it is time to convince his colleagues that the Golden State should become the latest U.S. State to get on the open formats bandwagon. The California initiative represents the third piece of legislation to the same purpose  to be filed in recent weeks (the 	
others were filed in Texas and Minnesota). A  link to the California bill is <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1651-1700/ab_1668_bill_20070223_introduced.html">here</a>, and the full text appears at  the end of this blog entry.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">As defined in the draft legislation, the bill would require that  &quot;all documents, including, but not limited to, text, spreadsheets, and  presentations, produced by any state agency shall be created, exchanged, and  preserved in an open extensible markup language-based, XML-based file format,  as specified by the department.&quot;&nbsp;Significantly the bill continues: </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">                  When deciding how to implement this section, the department in its  evaluation of open, XML-based file formats shall consider all of the following  features: </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p class="style2">                  (1) Interoperable among diverse internal  and external platforms and applications. <br>
                      (2) Fully published and available royalty-free. <br>
                      (3) Implemented by multiple vendors. <br>

                  </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2"> Happily for all concerned, this definition is very close, and in  many cases identical, to the open standards definitions used in both the Texas  and Minnesota bills.&nbsp;As I observed <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060409175642741">at the time that the original Minnesota  legislation was introduced</a> (which included a rather eclectic  definition of an open standard),&nbsp;it would do more harm than good for every  state to enact its own definition of an &quot;open standard.&quot;&nbsp;Were  this to happen, vendors would have neither the incentive, nor perhaps even the  ability, to meet the multiple procurement requirements that were legislated,  dooming the process to failure. </p>
                <p class="style2"> Like the Texas (but not the Minnesota) bill, the California  legislation calls for the appropriate IT state agency (in this case, the  California Department of IT Services) to create guidelines for use by state  agencies to decide whether a given product is based on &quot;open, XML-based  formats,&quot; which guidelines should take into account considerations such as  cost, the need for public accessibility and the expected storage life of the  documents in question.&nbsp;This language is identical to that included in the  Texas bill in its current form. </p>
                <p class="style2"> It was 18 months ago that Massachusetts launched this trend, when  its Information Technical Division revised the Enterprise Technical Resource  Model (ETRM) upon which its IT procurement is based.&nbsp;That revision not  only required open standards and welcomed open source in its procurement, but  also blessed a (then) relatively unknown open document format standard called  Open Document Format, or ODF.&nbsp;Since then, government procurement based on  open standards in general, and the virtues of ODF in particular, have been very  much in the spotlight.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style2"> 2006 saw the first filing of an open standards bill as well (in  Minnesota), after ODF had been in the news for some time.&nbsp; That bill was not voted on before the  legislative session ended.&nbsp; But earlier this year, the sponsor of the  original bill reintroduced a similar (and in my view, much improved) bill in Minnesota.&nbsp; Another bill was introduced  by a State  Senator in Texas, using an identical definition of open standards.&nbsp;I am  told that a State Representative has now agreed to join the State Senator as a  co-sponsor of the Texas bill, allowing it to progress to the next step of  consideration.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The California initiative was introduced by Democratic Assembly  Member <a href="http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a13/">Mark Leno</a>  as A B 1668, and  like the Texas bill, would (if enacted) go into force on January 1, 2008. </p>

                <p class="style2">The process of creating, maintaining  and studying of technical standards, as everyone knows (except,  those who  frequent this site)  must be dry as dust, deadly boring, and the very stuff of  which tedium is made.&nbsp; Granted, for  those versed in the craft, the creation of standards describing complex  interoperability interfaces must demand an attention to detail that might  capture the interest of those involved.&nbsp;  But to others,  standards must be totally opaque and meaningless &ndash;  mere arcane squigglings at best.</p>
                <p class="style2">How much more deadly then,  must be the creation and maintenance of those elementary and arbitrary, albeit  utilitarian, codes used to designate items within a single category of data that  need shorter and more uniform names in order to be efficiently processed -  time codes, country codes and such?&nbsp;  Truly, being one of the bit-stained wretches taxed with responsibility  for such binary trivia must be ultimately and terminally <em>boring.</em></p>
                <p class="style2">Right?&nbsp; Well, perhaps.&nbsp; But perhaps you should defer judgment until you've <em>Considered  This:</em></p>
                <p class="style2">One of the amazing things  that Google has brought to the world is the <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alert</a> &ndash; the modern analog to the  traditional fee-based clipping services that would scan newspapers and journals  for articles on a given subject on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But unlike a clipping service, which used to be quite pricey and  delivered its results only in periodic batches, Google Alerts arrive instantaneously  and for free.&nbsp; How cool (and  distracting) is that?</p>
                <p class="style2">Not long ago, one of my  standing Google Alerts delivered up a press release announcing that a new ISO  language code standard had been released.&nbsp;  What are language codes?&nbsp; In simplest  terms, they are more or less randomly assigned three-letter combinations that  can be used as universally recognized surrogates for the names of  languages.&nbsp; In that form, they can be   easily used as encodings to specify (for example) what language a Web site  uses.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">Just how many languages are  included in the standard?&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.sil.org/sil/news/2007/iso-639-3.htm">press release</a>, I  learned that the new version of ISO 639-3 categorizes a grand total of 7,546  languages, up dramatically from the 478 languages  included in the previous version.</p>
                <p class="style2">But the press release  hinted at some less unanticipated information as well, which piqued my interest, and  led me to dig a bit more deeply. The following are some of the things that  caught my fancy as I learned more.</p>
                <p class="style2">First, I found the scope of  the effort to be intriguing, as the standard includes <a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/types.asp#E">five categories</a> of  languages, and not just currently spoken (&quot;living&quot;) languages.&nbsp; The others are &quot;historical&quot; (i.e.,  archaic versions of still-spoken languages, such as Middle English),  &quot;extinct&quot; (languages that have passed from usage in the last  millennium), and &quot;Ancient&quot; (those that are no longer extant, and that  went extinct more than 1,000 years ago).&nbsp;  The final category?&nbsp; That's  &quot;constructed,&quot; which applies to artificial languages that are  intended to be used by humans, as compared to computers.&nbsp; Apparently, there have been many more such  languages created than just Esperanto (one <a href="http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.html">Web site</a> states that  there are more than 300 such languages, (most used only by their creators), including Klingon &ndash; a constructed  language that ISO has not as yet seen fit to include in ISO 639-3).</p>
                <p class="style2">Next, browsing through the  languages of the world is a fascinating pursuit in its own right.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style2">If you love language for  language's sake, you will appreciate the richness of the names of the languages  themselves. Consider, for example, these  selections, taken from just those languages that have been given codes beginning  with the letter &quot;a.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">For example, there are the lyrical African languages <em>Alumu-Tesu,&nbsp;  Mandobo Atas, Abaga </em>and <em>Aka-Bea</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, reduced to three letter sequences, they become to simply <em>aab, aax, abg</em>, and, just as abjectly, <em>abj</em>.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">But never mind that for  now.&nbsp; Instead, enjoy more originals &ndash;  languages with percussive names, such as these Mezzo-American tongues: <em>Cubulco  Achi and Aguacateco</em>&nbsp; Or those with  more mysterious sounds, such as <em>Acheron </em>and<em> Galo Adi</em>, </p>
                <p class="style2">Many  are simply fun to  roll off the tongue &ndash; languages with names like <em>Obojuitai, Akawaio</em> and <em>Anakalangu</em>.&nbsp; Or how about another Amerindian language: <em>Amahuaca</em>?</p>
                <p class="style2">Some names are funky rather  than lyrical.&nbsp; Try <em>Achterhoeks,  Dzodinka</em>, <em>Pudtol Atta,</em> and my personal favorite, which is <em>Akhvakh</em>,  which seems to call for a !Kung people-style, introductory exclamation mark to  be fully appreciated.&nbsp; Or perhaps you  can't help thinking of those insurance commercials <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflac#Aflac_Duck">with the duck (<em>AFLAC!</em>)</a>.</p>
                <p class="style2">Other languages provide  multicultural history lessons, such as <em>Saint Lucian Creole French</em>, or <em>Judeo-Tunisian  Arabic</em> (what's the deal with that one?) or offer ethno-geographic  snapshots, like <em>Mescalero-Chiricahua Apache.</em></p>
                <p class="style2">Some language names present  puzzles &ndash; where exactly does <em>Alabama</em> come from if not&hellip;?&nbsp; And who is that speaks <em>War</em> on an  everyday basis?&nbsp; Others are simply  unfortunate, at least to an English speaker: <em>Bozoum</em> is not too bad, but  how about <em>Anal</em> and <em>Anus?</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In this case, the three letter code combinations <em>anm</em> and <em>auq</em>,  respectively, are Occidental improvements.</p>
                <p class="style2">Some language names can't  fail to raise a smile of a different sort, particularly when grouped together,  such as <em> Mia Brat, Omie, Abom, </em>and ultimately, <em>Amuzgo,</em> so <em>Solong.&nbsp; </em></p>
                <p class="style2">And if <em>Molmo One</em> were  a jet, would it be an <em>Awak</em>?</p>
                <p class="style2">Or perhaps you enjoy parlor  games.&nbsp; In that case, say this one five  times quickly:&nbsp; <em>Adynyamathanha.</em></p>
                <p class="style2">The one of a kind prize in  the A series, however, must unquestionably go to <em>=/Kx'aul//'ein</em>.&nbsp; If you're curious where that one is spoken,  as I was, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=SUNA,SUNA:2005-42,SUNA:en&q=%3d%2fKx%27au%2f%2f%27ein">Google  it</a> and find out (it's often spoken, but presumably seldom spelled, in  Namibia).</p>
                <p class="style2">All of which makes for good  fun.&nbsp; But as a matter of fact, there's  also a more serious back story.&nbsp; ISO  639-3, you see, is not maintained by a typical standards organization.&nbsp; Instead, the Registrar appointed by ISO to  be its custodian  is called SIL International, an organization  with a mission that is as interesting as its history.</p>
                <p class="style2">SIL, you see, derives from  the organization's original name, which was the <em>Summer Institute of  Linguistics</em>, an organization founded by <a href="http://www.sil.org/WCT/wct_bio1.html">William Cameron Townsend</a> (1896  &ndash; 1982), who departed for Guatemala in 1919, accompanied by crates filled with  the Bible in Spanish to distribute to the indigenous peoples of Central  America.&nbsp; When he arrived, however, he  found to his chagrin that the native Guatemalans did not in fact speak  Spanish.&nbsp; But in that realization, he  found his  life-long calling as well.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">Instead of completing his  original plan, Townsend moved up country, settling in with the Mayan  Cakchiquel.&nbsp; There, he learned to speak  their <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=92230">language</a>,  developed an alphabet to record it, and with the help of assistants, translated  the New Testament into Cakchiquel.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">Moreover, unlike the  stereotypical Ugly American, he began to develop a personal &quot;Philosophy of  Three Part Service,&quot; summarized at the SIL International Website as  follows:<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Townsend&hellip;insisted that members of SIL should  be ready to serve others scientifically, materially, and spiritually. From  early in his career Townsend was personally committed to each of these three  areas of involvement. It is not sufficient, he argued, that a person should be  interested in serving people unless he has that scientific preparation which  will make his contribution relevant and effective. Service based on a  foundation of scientific investigation, he held, is more likely to have a  permanent impact than service motivated by high ideals but without a thorough  understanding of the people being served.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Of special importance, he maintained, is a  careful study of a people's language and, by means of that language, an  acquired insight into their aspirations and goals. But a scientific study in  which the investigator is interested merely in amassing data about the people  studied and not in helping them reach worthy goals may have some value to the  scientific world, but it will have ignored human values. Townsend affirmed that  scientific knowledge should be used as a means for offering developing people  the <em>resource of choice</em> for bettering their daily lives. Additionally, he  taught that unless a minority people can adjust to their place in the changing  world and, with economic assistance, learn something of the acquired wisdom of  humankind, these people may sink into apathy or despair.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Crucial to a well-rounded program for  minority-language groups, Townsend believed, is the spiritual component.  Natural religion, defined as man's seeking for an integrating explanation of  his life and world, indicates that all people have deep, unfulfilled spiritual  needs. An adequate effort to serve minority-language communities, he believed,  must take cognizance of this spiritual dimension. It may not be convenient for  some individuals or for a government to be involved in such matters, but for a  private organization it is appropriate. It can devote itself to the tasks of  scientific investigation and at the same time to practical service and to  spiritual orientation. This three-phased objective molded Townsend's career.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">Townsend founded a number of affiliated  non-profits to further his service ideals, one of which was SIL  International.&nbsp; A quarter-century after  Townsend's death, that organization describes itself as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">Founded over 70 years ago, SIL International is  a faith-based organization that studies, documents, and assists in developing  the world&rsquo;s lesser-known languages. SIL&rsquo;s staff shares a Christian commitment  to service, academic excellence, and professional engagement through literacy,  linguistics, translation, and other academic disciplines. SIL makes its services  available to all without regard to religious belief, political ideology,  gender, race, or ethnic background.</p>
                  <p class="style2">SIL&hellip;has grown from a small summer linguistics  training program with two students in 1934 to a staff of over 5,000 coming from  over 60 countries. SIL&rsquo;s linguistic investigation exceeds 1,800 languages  spoken by over 1.2 billion people in more than 70 countries. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  If you read further at the <a href="http://www.sil.org/sil/">SIL Web site</a>, you'll learn that it has been  granted formal consultative status by UNESCO, and that it focuses on unwritten  languages, because, &quot;[p]eople who speak these languages often live in  geographic, social, and economic isolation. Studying these languages results in  practical help for local people and contributes to the broader knowledge of <a href="http://www.sil.org/linguistics/">linguistics</a>, <a href="http://www.sil.org/anthro/">anthropology</a>, and <a href="http://www.sil.org/anthro/ethnomusicology.htm">ethnomusicology</a>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll also see that SIL researches and  develops software and speech analysis tools, among many other activities,  and that, &quot;most SIL workers develop individual  funding resources for particular projects and personal support.&quot; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  Of course, it is also the <a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/default.asp">Registration  Authority</a> for ISO 639-3, which is based in large part on its own <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=92230">Ethnologue</a> (15th edition), subtitled <em>An  encyclopedic reference work cataloging all of the world&rsquo;s 6,912 known living  languages</em>.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">All of which goes to show that  creating and  maintaining even something as mundane as a three letter language code standard  may not be quite as boring an enterprise as it might at first seem to be.&nbsp; And, perhaps also, that even in the case of  standards, the Lord does indeed work in mysterious ways.</p>

                <p class="style2">The  members of the OASIS ODF Adoption TC will be hosting a half-day workshop  dedicated to topics important to understanding the ODF standard and its  technology.&nbsp; The workshop is open to  OASIS members and non-members alike.&nbsp;  Further information may be found <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/events/symposium/2007/wednesday-friday.php#odfworksho">here</a>,  and registration information is <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/events/symposium/2007/registration.php">here</a>.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Due  to the emergence of multiple ODF supporting applications interoperability of  content and presentation is a user requirement. Ongoing efforts within the  Formula and Metadata subcommittees are addressing these issues. In the area of  programmability, several toolkit projects have emerged that promise to simplify  the development of new, innovative ODF supporting applications. OpenDocument  Format solutions and applications must meet and serve the needs of Persons with  Disabilities. The new ODF v1.1 specification paves the way for Assistive  Technology Vendors (ATVs) to implement support for ODF implementations. And  lastly, pubic policy change in major governments is accelerating the adoption  of ODF.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Agenda  items include:</p>
