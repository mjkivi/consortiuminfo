                  </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Rather incredibly - to me  &ndash;the <strong><em>Consortium Standards Bulletin </em></strong>begins its fourth full year of  publication with this issue.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Much has changed in the  intervening time.&nbsp; But it's also  surprising how much has not, as you can see from the editorial in the December  2002 Inaugural Issue, which was titled &quot;IPR Policies: a Call to (Lay Down)  Arms.&quot;&nbsp; That editorial refers to private litigation  involving alleged abuses of the JEDEC standards process by memory technology  company Rambus, and an investigation into the same course of conduct that was  then about to be launched against the same company by the Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp; <img src="jan06/dec02.png" alt="December 2002" width="358" height="326" align="left"></p>
                  
                  <p align="left" class="style2">While Rambus settled one  suit against Infineon last year, its legal action against a number of other companies  continue to grind on, as does the FTC proceeding.&nbsp; And the terms of IPR policies continue to be the source of as  much, or more, contention than ever.&nbsp;  Were we to run our first editorial today with only factual updating, it  would still (regrettably) make as much sense now as it did then.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">But times have changed while  the <em><strong>CSB</strong></em> has been bringing you the news, and in some cases, for the better.&nbsp; In that same editorial I called for the  following: </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">What's needed is for the industry to have a  &quot;constitutional convention&quot; to set a standard policy - a policy which  will have alternative terms for a limited number of situations where  alternatives are truly needed, but also a well articulated rationale for each  alternative, stating where and why that alternative is appropriate. Its time  for the industry to compromise once, and agree many times thereafter. Once this  is accomplished, the industry can get back to the far more important business  of standard setting, rather than arguing about how to do it. </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Indeed, an ABA subcommittee  has now been toiling for more than a year to create just such a document.&nbsp; In another favorable development, a number  of companies are advocating for more stringent standard setting  disclosure rules &ndash; and even for early discussion of licensing terms, which the  U.S. Department of Justice has signaled it would find to be pro-competitive under  the antitrust laws, if properly managed.&nbsp;  The reason?&nbsp; Even IT companies  with the largest patent portfolios have come to realize that good standards can  be worth  more to them than the licensing revenue of their own  patents.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">So as we look forward to  2006, there are reasons for encouragement as well as frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in this issue, we look backward, and  present what I think were the most significant events, issues organizations  (and more) from the year just ended.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This issue's <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong> expands on this evaluation, concluding that while 2005 was a difficult year  marred by a lack of cooperation in all too many venues, ultimately the  successes outnumbered the failures, regardless of the amount of stomach lining  consumed in the process.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Recognizing the futility of  summarizing all of the important stories, or even trends, of 2005, this month's <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong>&nbsp; focuses  instead on what I believe to have been most newsworthy in the year just ended.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This issue also includes my  annual <strong><em>News Sources Awards</em></strong>, this time in several additional  categories as well.&nbsp; I've appreciated  the good work of the hundreds of standards organizations, open source projects,  news services, individual journalists, community sites and bloggers that together have  helped  to get out and analyze the news. Accordingly, the awards are my way of  providing some small measure of recognition to those that I thought did the  best job of raising the profile of standards, and explaining to their readers  why standards matter.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Next, you will see <strong><em>Our  Year in</em></strong> <strong><em>Review,</em></strong> being a brief overview of some of the  things that have been happening this year here at ConsortiumInfo.org, followed  by this month's selection from the <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> (relating to  our Standards Story of the Year).&nbsp; The  issue closes with a less serious entry from <strong><em>Consider This&hellip;</em></strong></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">All in all, it's been an  extremely active year in the world of standards, and therefore an equally busy  year at ConsortiumInfo.org.&nbsp; In light of  the expanded activities at the site, I've decided to set the <strong><em>CSB</em></strong> calendar for 2006 at ten issues instead of twelve, omitting the August and  December issues.&nbsp; This will provide time  at this end to catch up on other site projects, not to mention extra time with  my family, separate from my ever-present wireless-enabled laptop.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">So as you read this issue  looking backward, I hope that you are looking forward to the New Year, and to  what lies ahead.&nbsp;  Whatever that may be, I'll personally look forward to doing my best to  investigate it, think about it, and report on it to you here at the <strong><em>CSB</em></strong>.</p>
                  <div align="left"><span class="style2">As  always, I hope you enjoy this issue.&nbsp;</span></div>

              <p align="center" class="style10"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></strong></font></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As in time past, I began my  preparations for this &quot;Year in Review&quot; issue by scanning the  individual news items (more than 700 in 2005) that I  culled from thousands  more for posting at the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news">News  Portal</a> of this site.&nbsp; After  completing that task, I  asked myself what single word might best  sum up the world of standards in 2005.&nbsp;  I was rather dismayed that the word that immediately sprang to mind, and  best seemed to fit, was &quot;struggle.&quot;</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Indeed,  there was a great deal of contention, as well as outright confrontation,  everywhere one might care to look for it: within standard setting  organizations, such as IEEE, where rival factions pushed for adoption of their  favored flavor for the next standard in the 802.11 family of wireless  standards; between consortia, as in the battle to the death still raging  between the supporters of the HD-DVD and the Blu-ray next generation DVD formats;  between individual countries and the rest of the world, as with the ongoing  efforts by China to protect its domestic industries through standards within  the constraints established by the World Trade Organization's  Act on Technical Barriers to Trade; and last  but not least, the struggle of just about everyone in the IT industry to cope  with the current flawed patent regime in the United States. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Of  course, there were successes, too, but while some of these so-called  &quot;successes&quot; may have resolved an issue (at least for a time), they  were really defeats of one side by another, with the public, positive  statements of the losing side smacking of face-saving efforts to put the best  spin on what was in fact a retreat.&nbsp;  Certainly this was the case when the deadlock between the United States  and most of the rest of the world over &quot;Internet governance&quot; was  broken just prior to the formal convening of the World Summit on the  Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis.&nbsp; In such  one-sided victories, it may be that a different resolution has merely been  delayed, rather than defeated.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As the  new year begins, then, it is worth asking this question: Has the world of  standard setting really grown to be more contentious, and if so, why?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">I  suspect that it would be untrue to state that standard setting has suddenly  become more adversarial across the board.&nbsp;  But I expect that a case could be made that within the information and  communications technology (ICT) sector it has become more of a contact sport  over the course of the last several years, and that the last twelve months have  been particularly good examples of this willingness to mix it up.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Why  would this be true?&nbsp; Most obviously,  because ITC standards matter more now than ever, and in more ways than ever  before, both positively and negatively.&nbsp;  Standards can still create new product opportunities, but if all of the  patents that they infringe are owned (for example) in the West, then  manufacturers in the East (e.g., in China), may find themselves at a great  disadvantage, and desirous of creating standards of their own.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Similarly,  when a single manufacturer has a valuable monopoly (such as Microsoft, with its  Office productivity suite), then it is more likely to work against rather than  support a standard -- such as the OpenDocument OASIS format &ndash; that could  threaten that monopoly.&nbsp; And again, if  one country has control of a key component of a valuable ITC resource, such as  the root directories of the Internet (which are maintained under the  supervision of the United States Department of Commerce) and a go it alone  attitude to boot, then it's likely that such a country will exhibit a &quot;my  way or the highway&quot; response to requests for joint control.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Each of  these examples of contention has received ample coverage in the news this year,  along with far too many other stories of a similar kind.&nbsp; It is likely that 2006 will bring more of  the same. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Still,  there is reason for optimism, for 2005 also brought news of countervailing  actions in the marketplace, such as patent pledges by major IT vendors in  support of open source software development efforts, and the continuing  evolution of what many have come to refer to as Web 2.0, built not only upon  formal efforts such as the upgrading of the RSS and Atom syndication standards,  but also upon nonprofit projects (e.g., the Wikipedia), free tools (e.g.,  de.lic.ious bookmarks) and entrepreneurial ventures (such as www.flickr.com) &ndash;  not to mention the enthusiastic, organic and experimental currents that have  swirled around the Web, based upon these and thousands of other sites, blogs and  shared ideas.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">And  finally, there is the underlying dynamic of standard setting, which is  this:&nbsp; compliance with standards is  essentially a voluntary act.&nbsp; Unlike the  political system, which bestows upon the majority the power of the state, and  therefore the ability to oppress a minority even over long periods of time, the  standards system is based upon a balance of self-interest and common  benefit.&nbsp; No player can push that  balance too far or for too long in its own direction before it begins to lose  more than it gains by way of market reaction.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Of  course, this dynamic does not restore equilibrium in real time, and only by  coincidence is any individual cog in the standards machine in equipoise at any  given moment.&nbsp; But overall, it is a  self-correcting system, and that is a very powerful wind to have at one's back.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">So it is  that as 2005 closes, we may well look with trepidation towards the discrete  events of the year to come.&nbsp; But we can  also anticipate with fair confidence that at this time next year, notwithstanding  all of the gnashing of teeth and sleight of hand that may lie between now and  then, we will be looking back on another year during which accomplishments  outnumbered failures, and where for all of the pushing and pulling, the vast  majority continued to play within the system.</p>

              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Introduction:</em>&nbsp; </strong>2005 was a busy standards year &ndash; far busier than can  be summarized in one article, or even one issue of this journal.&nbsp; The year had both high and low points,  victories as well as losses, and stories that simply went sideways or sputtered  out entirely.</p>
              <p class="style2">In many ways, the year was  characterized by struggle, as noted in this issue's <strong><em><a href="#editorial">Editorial</a>,</em></strong> in part because it was also beset by increasing complexity on many fronts:  patent thickets grew thicker while the United States patent system became  increasing recognized for contributing to the problem; nations and regions  became more skilled at incorporating standards into their commercial  strategies; major corporations did as well; and with the increasing success of  open source software came friction between the simple concept of Free and Open  Software and the more complex licensing practices of traditional standard  setting participants.</p>
              <p class="style2">But the flip side of the  coin is that these same complexities often arose from the fact that the  importance of standards is becoming better recognized.&nbsp; With this realization of value and  importance, for better or worse, comes greater incentive for commercial and  governmental interests to play the standards game for maximum benefit.</p>
              <p class="style2">In this third Annual Review  of the year in standards, I will therefore not attempt to summarize every  major event or story of the year just ended.&nbsp;  Instead, I will memorialize what I believe to have been the most  newsworthy highs and lows of the last twelve months, so that readers now and in  the future can remember the best &ndash; and the worst &ndash; that 2005 had to offer.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>1<em>&#9658;Standards Story of the Year:&nbsp; </em><span class="style114">Massachusetts and OpenDocument</span></strong> <br>
  There was little doubt in my mind what to recognize as the 2005 IT  standards story of the year.&nbsp; It  involves a visionary (and now toppled) leader in the person of State CIO Peter  Quinn, who announced his resignation to his employees on Christmas eve; a  battle between the largest IT companies in the world, as companies like IBM and  Sun saw an opening to break Microsoft's ownership of the office productivity  software market; infighting among politicians in a scrabble for control of  state IT procurement; the future of not only open standards but of open source  software as well; the need for software vendors &ndash; and standards developers &ndash; to  serve the accessibility needs of those with disabilities; the preservation of  the historical record; and whether you or I will be able to access our individual  past in the future.</p>
              <p class="style2">My coverage of this saga began at the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=30">News Portal</a> on  September 1st,and at the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30">Standards Blog</a> on September 17th.&nbsp; I dedicated the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php">September issue</a> to  the story, and have continued to follow it in all three of these venues ever  since &ndash; as I will in 2006, since the story is far from over.</p>
              <p class="style2">The  twists and turns of this story are too Byzantine to be summarized in this  article, but you can access the full database of news stories and blog entries,  both already existing and as new material is added in the future, <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=30">here</a>.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>2<em>&#9658;Open Source Story of the Year:</em>&nbsp; <span class="style114">The  Embrace of Open Source by Big IT</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">While 2005 was not the first  year in which big information technology companies invested heavily in Linux  (IBM most prominently passed through that knothole years ago), 2005 was the year  in which the floodgates opened, with many companies making public  pronouncements as well as private strategic decisions intended to boost  customer confidence and interest not just in Linux, but in open source  alternatives to proprietary software products in general.</p>
              <p class="style2">The most dramatic evidence  of this trend was a series of public announcements by major patent owners that  they would not assert their patents against Linux, and in some cases, against  any open source software product.&nbsp; Those  announcements were intended to allay customer concerns relating to the  consequence of porous patent laws, and to underline the marketing message that  the open source train was gathering steam, having already left the station.</p>
              <p class="style2">The first announcement was  made by IBM, which on January 10 <a href="http://www.ibm.com/news/us/en/2005/01/patents.html">pledged</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">&hellip;to open  access to key innovations covered by 500 IBM software patents to people and  groups working on open source software. The pledge applies to any individual,  community, or company working on or using software that meets the Open Source  Initiative (OSI) definition of open source software.&nbsp; This is believed to be the largest pledge ever of patents of any  kind and represents a major shift in the way IBM manages and deploys its  intellectual property portfolio.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">IBM's  pledge was followed rapidly by (often curiously reminiscent) announcements by  other multinational IT vendors.&nbsp; Sun  Microsystems, for example, <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-01/sunflash.20050125.2.html">announced</a> a scant 15 days later:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">&hellip; the largest single release of  patent innovations into the open source community by any organization to date,  marking a significant shift in the way Sun positions its intellectual property  portfolio&hellip;. [S]aid Scott McNealy, Chairman and CEO, Sun Microsystems,  Inc. &quot;The release of more than 1,600 patents associated with the Solaris  OS far eclipses any other vendor's contribution. Today represents a huge  milestone for Sun, for the community, for developers and for customers.&quot; <br>
                  A  more modest pledge was later made by Computer Associates, which was reported on  March 3 to be planning a pledge of its own (it made its formal commitment in  support of IBM's pledge on September 7, involving <a href="http://www3.ca.com/press/PressRelease.aspx?CID=73958">14 patents</a> of  its own).&nbsp; Nokia made its own pledge in  support of Linux <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3508146">in May</a>.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">Other  actions of many types followed.&nbsp; In  August, Novell announced that it would open source its flagship <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/08/03/HNnovellopensuse_1.html">Suse  Linux</a> software, and even less directly involved vendors shifted position  towards a world in which open source software might become even more  powerful.&nbsp; Intel, for example, announced  in May that it had formed an internal <a href="http://news.com.com/Intel+forms+internal+open-source+group/2100-7344_3-5702371.html">open  source group</a>.&nbsp; In April, it was even  announced that Microsoft had <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1791085,00.asp">extended an olive  branch</a> to the open source community (although no watershed change in its  public strategy followed its call for a &quot;for a sit-down to discuss how the software giant can better work with  the open-source world.&quot;)</p>
              <p class="style2">By  the end of the year, it seemed certain that the open source genie would never  be tricked back into the proprietary bottle, if only because too many  proprietary vendors were themselves too committed to any longer back away from  their public commitments. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>3<em>&#9658;Standard of the Year: </em><span class="style114">XML</span>&nbsp; </strong> </p>
              <p class="style2">If there was a standard of  the year, surely it was XML.&nbsp; But not  just XML (which achieved W3C Recommendation status on February 10, 1998), but  all of its schematic and other children &ndash; whether supported by independent  organizations (such as XBRL international, which has adapted&nbsp; XML for public accounting reporting  purposes), organizations within organizations (such as LegalXML, a Member  Section within OASIS, which in turn supports a myriad of XML-related  activities), less formal multi-member forums, and even individual companies,  university labs and government agencies.</p>
              <p class="style2">In fact, there are few  information domains in which XML cannot be useful &ndash; and in most cases, has  already been put to use - from human resources HR-XML Consortium, to  sports data (<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/links/detail.php?ID=465">SportsML</a>).&nbsp; This trend continued in 2005, with the  formation of new groups, both formal and informal, including the <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/newsitems/2005/sept2005/09-29-05-news-hupo">International  Molecular Exchange</a> (Imex), which was formed to &quot;jointly curate and  exchange data&quot; in the five publicly available databases that are based  upon the Molecular Interaction XML Interchange standard developed for  proteomics use.</p>
              <p class="style2">Look  for more activities of all types involving XML in 2006 (and after).</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>4<em>&#9658;Standards Developer of the Year (Organization):</em> <span class="style114">OASIS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">By almost any measure, OASIS  was the standards development organization that found itself (by design or  otherwise) in the middle of the most action in the IT sector.&nbsp; All in the same year, it:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">Continued to play a central role in the       development of Web services and other e-business standards</li>
                <li class="style2">&nbsp;Completed a nearly three year struggle to achieve consensus       on one of the first formal intellectual property policies to offer an       elective rules track to create standards that would be friendly to open       source software implementations (OASIS was then <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/pdf/mar05/editorial.pdf">condemned</a> for its trouble in a letter signed by 29 open source advocates, who wanted       OASIS to mandate use of the open source-friendly terms for all of its       Technical Committees)</li>
                <li class="style2">Adopted and released eight new standards,       including version 1.0 of the OpenDocument format in May, providing the       first open office productivity application format (and the basis for the       commercial and political struggle in <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php">Massachusetts</a> that I named above as the 2005 Standards Story of the Year).</li>
                <li class="style2">Launched six new Technical Committees to address       a wide array of new needs..</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">While some other consortia  and accredited standards developers may have had more projects in motion in  2005, it was OASIS that, through a perfect storm of commercial and political  forces, found itself to be at the center of more of what was newsworthy in 2005  than any other organization.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>5<em>&#9658;Standards Developer of the Year (Country):</em>&nbsp; <span class="style114">China</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">In April, we dedicated an  issue of the <strong><em>CSB</em></strong> to the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/apr05.php">rising power</a> of  China, which has deployed its formidable resources to the creation of what may  be the best funded and staffed standards infrastructure that the world has ever  seen.&nbsp; While that infrastructure appears  to still be finding its voice in the established bureaucracy of global standard  setting, the influence that China can be expected to assert will be  substantial, given the size of the market subject to its control.</p>
              <p class="style2">China has even more reasons  to flex its standards muscles than most countries, given the preponderance of  patents in the West that currently forces it to function as the cut-rate job  shop for the high-priced occidental brands that reap the margins generated by  the sweat of Chinese brows.&nbsp; If China  can create and enforce its own standards without violating the World Trade  Organization's Technical Barriers to Trade Act, it will do so, adding another  weapon to an already formidable commercial armamentarium. </p>
              <p class="style2">Already, there have been  major international repercussions over China's efforts to require compliance  with a home-grown wireless standard.&nbsp;  That issue has only been partially resolved, and additional tests are in  the offing involving Chinese  standards for 3G cell phones, DVD  players and video/video compression.</p>
              <p class="style2">Stay tuned.&nbsp; You'll be hearing more on this story in 2006  as well.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>6<em>&#9658;Intellectual Property Issue of the Year:</em>&nbsp; <span class="style114">The ITC Patent Mess</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">To paraphrase an old saying,  &quot;Nobody doesn't love to hate the U.S. patent system.&quot;&nbsp; And well they might, as a variety of events in  2005 demonstrated.</p>
              <p class="style2">On the litigation front,  multiple high-profile lawsuits ground on that many considered to involve  patents that should never have been issued, while new threats emerged involving  patents that are also popularly thought to be invalid.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">An example of continuing  litigation was the ongoing effort by a one-employee company called Eolas  Technologies to collect on a multi-hundred million dollar judgment against  Microsoft involving the Internet Explorer browser &ndash; a threat that had earlier  inspired a plea to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) by the W3C,  signed personally by Tim Berners-Lee, to void the patent in question.&nbsp; An example of a new threat is the contention  of another small company, this time based in North Carolina and called  Scientigo, which claims that use of <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/BizTech/wtr_14885,311,p1.html">XML</a> (first released in 1998) would infringe its patent.</p>
              <p class="style2">At the same time, endemic  cries against the formation and funding of new patent &quot;trolls&quot; (i.e.,  companies formed for the sole purpose of purchasing, and asserting, patents  against operating companies) reached the pages of even the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05257/571396.stm">Wall Street Journal</a>.&nbsp; One such company is Acacia Technologies,  which has acquired 120 patents in a variety of technical areas and has brought  suit already against companies large and small, including Intel.&nbsp; Another, named Thinkfire, is venture backed  and was founded by former Microsoft chief technology officer Nathan  Myhrvold.&nbsp; Thinkfire licenses patents it  has purchased, and manages those owned by others as well.</p>
              <p class="style2">At the heart of the matter  is the long-held belief that patents in the U.S., and particularly software  patents, are <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov03.php">too  easy to get and too hard to challenge</a>, thereby enabling the owners of  patents that should never have been issued to put innocent software developers  and end-users to the choice of paying up or facing an uphill &ndash; and extremely  expensive &ndash; battle in court to challenge those patents.&nbsp; A bill is currently in Congress to address  the situation, but the opinions on the specific changes that should be made to existing  law are as fiercely held as they are diverse.</p>
              <p class="style2">Meanwhile, 2005 saw a  pitched battle in Europe over whether to permit the award of software patents  at all.&nbsp; By years end, the question had  been overwhelmingly answered in the <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8473537/">negative</a>,  at least for now.&nbsp; And in this country,  various initiatives were launched in support of open source software, while  awaiting whatever relief, if any, Congress might provide.&nbsp; One such initiative was an information  resource launched by Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) to create an <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/11/15/HNonlinepatents_1.html">on-line  patent commons reference library</a>.&nbsp;  More ambitiously, an <a href="http://opensource.sys-con.com/read/152384.htm">open invention network</a> was formed by IBM, Philips, Sony, Red Hat, and  Novell to actually buy patents that might be infringed by Linux users, in order <em>not</em> to assert them.</p>
              <p class="style2">As the year  ended, it appeared that the best that could be hoped for would be the eventual  passage of a patent reform bill that would be likely to leave everyone equally  unhappy.</p>
              <p class="style2">All in all, no  one was happy with the U.S. patent system in 2005 &ndash; except the trolls.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>7<em>&#9658;International (Non?) Event of the Year:&nbsp; </em><span class="style114">WSIS</span></strong> </p>
              <p class="style2">Perhaps the only thing that  was less popular in 2005 than U.S. patent laws was the U.S. position on a  question that came to be phrased, &quot;Who Should Govern the Internet?&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">As I reported for months at  the ConsortiumInfo.org <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=25">News Portal</a> and  explored in depth in the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov05.php">November</a> issue of  the <strong><em>CSB</em></strong>, the controversy focused on whether the U.S. would (as  earlier promised) or would not (as it announced in June) relinquish control of  the Internet Council on Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN).&nbsp; Internationally, pressure and angst mounted  following the U.S. backtracking, while domestic determination not to give in  rose in equal measure.</p>
              <p class="style2">By the time the second  plenary meeting of the World Summit on the Internet Society (WSIS), a multi-year  endeavor commissioned by the United Nations and administered by the  International Telecommunication Union, convened in Tunis, virtually all other  topics had been eclipsed by the Internet governance controversy.</p>
              <p class="style2">At the last minute, a  compromise (of sorts) was reached that largely gave the U.S. what it wanted &ndash;  continuation of the status quo &ndash; while granting those that wanted a global  resource to be administered collectively only a new &quot;Internet Governance  Forum&quot; that might &ndash; or might not &ndash; grow into something meaningful.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong>&nbsp; All in all,  the Year in Standards was contentious and clamorous, and by turns both regressive  and progressive, infuriating and encouraging -- much like the year in domestic  and international relations.&nbsp; It's a  safe bet that we can look forward to more of the same in 2006, as few of the  stories highlighted above have run their course, nor have the underlying  conditions, attitudes and strategic interests that fueled their heat abated.</p>

              <p align="center"> <strong> <span class="style10"><strong>STANDARDS NEWS SOURCES OF THE YEAR </strong> </span></strong></p>
              <p align="center"><strong><em> </em></strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></strong></font><br>
              </p>
              <p class="style2">For the second year in a row, I would like to recognize  those news sources that I believe did the best job of bringing  standards-relevant information and analysis to the on-line world.&nbsp; As I stated in last year's awards article:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"> To state  the obvious, standards news reportage does not receive the type of attention  and awards that movies and Broadway shows (or even advertisements) attract.  While the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) annually bestows its  President&rsquo;s Award for Journalism to an individual reporter, we are aware of no  official recognition given to those standards organizations that release the  most noteworthy news, or the media that provide the most thorough and  discriminating specific coverage of the standards world. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">This year, I am expanding the  categories of news providers I would like to recognize to include not only  news services and standards organizations, but also individual journalists, bloggers  and community site editors as well. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Methodology:</em></strong>&nbsp; The awards that appear below are of two types.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Statistical Awards:</em></strong>&nbsp; As was the case last year, this set of awards was determined  solely by reviewing and tabulating those articles and press releases that I  selected to present and link to at the ConsortiumInfo.org <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/">News Portal</a> during 2005 &ndash; more  than 700 items in all, out of the thousands of articles and press releases I  reviewed in the course of the year.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                The  larger sample set from which these 700 plus items were chosen was harvested  through three methods:</p>
              <ol>
                <li class="style2">Use  of a series of standards and open source focused Google Alerts, most of which  were in place throughout the year, but some of which were added in response to  new stories as they developed as the year progressed</li>
                <li class="style2">Press  releases sent directly to ConsortiumInfo.org by many of the 455 standards  organizations and open source projects listed at the ConsortiumInfo.org <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/links/">Consortium and Standards List</a> (if your organization does not currently send press releases to  ConsortiumInfo.org, please find out how to do so <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/commcenter/#grpr">here</a>).</li>
                <li class="style2">My  own use of the Web and all it has to offer.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Awards:</em></strong>&nbsp;  Because the database used above does not include some of the other  sources of information upon which many of us rely (e.g.,&nbsp; blogs are under-represented at the News  Portal &ndash; something I plan to correct this year), the second set of awards is  more subjective, in that it is limited to those sources of which I have become  aware by various means, and which I personally found to be most useful in  finding, understanding, and presenting the news this year.</p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                <span class="style113">Sample Set:</span> During the measuring period, I included news  received from hundreds of sources based in many countries around the world that  in most instances fell into one of the following three groupings: </p>
              <ol>
                <li class="style2"> Standard setting organizations, open source projects and other  non-profit sources.</li>
                <li class="style2"> News portals, on-line journals, on-line versions of magazines and  newspapers, and other for-profit media outlets.</li>
                <li class="style2"> Blogs and community sites.                  </li>
                </ol>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style113">Selection Criteria:</span> In order to be chosen for  posting at the News Portal, a news item must fall into one or more of the 22  categories of news I cover at the News Portal  shown at left.</p>
                  <p align="left"><img src="jan06/news.png" alt="news" width="156" height="465" align="left"><span class="style2">In one  single category (New Consortia) inclusion is automatic, but in all others, a story must also  have additional qualities that I believe make it not  only newsworthy, but relevant and interesting to the ConsortiumInfo.org  audience as well. </span></p>
                  <p align="left"><span class="style2">                    What  makes a standards story relevant and interesting (at least to me)?&nbsp; The following are some of the criteria I  look for in a story and/or in its presentation: </span></p>
                  <ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="style2">&middot; Does it recognize the       role of a standards or open source organization, or of a standard or of       open source software, in the story?</li>
                      <li class="style2">&middot; Does it relate to       information or communications technology; if not, does it relate to some       other standards area that has more than purely commercial relevance? </li>
                      <li class="style2">&middot; Does it relate to how we live, work or transact       business? </li>
                      <li class="style2">&middot; Does it illustrate the importance of standards or       open source to society? </li>
                      <li class="style2">&middot; Does it help a reader understand what standards       or open source are all about? </li>
                      <li class="style2">&middot; Will the standard, open source software, or event in question       have a major impact beyond its purely technical ramifications? </li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
              <p class="style2">Additional  criteria for certain categories appear below.</p>
              <p class="style2">                My  particular thanks go to the individuals that have chosen to write such stories,  and to the media that have agreed that these stories deserve to be made  available to the world ( please keep up the good work ). </p>
              <p class="style2">                Without  further ado, here are the 2005 ConsortiumInfo.org News Sources of the Year  Awards.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>I.&nbsp; Statistical Awards</strong><br>
                              <strong>1<em>&#9658;Award:</em><span class="style114">&nbsp; Most  Newsworthy Standard Setting Organization </span></strong><br>
                              <strong><em>(Consortium, Accredited Standards Developer or Open  Source Project) </em></strong><br>
                The  following awards do not indicate which standards organizations were most  prolific in generating new (or amended) standards, but rather which ones  received the most attention in the media as a result of the work that they  performed during the year.&nbsp; The items  counted included both press releases issued by the organization as well as  inclusions in the title or lead sentences of on-line articles.</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>First Place:</em>&nbsp; <span class="style114">Organization for the Advancement of Structured       Information Systems</span> </strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/home/index.php">(OASIS)</a> -&nbsp; 47 Items <em>[Last year: Third Place]</em></li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Second Place:&nbsp; </em><span class="style114">World Wide Web Consortium</span> <a href="http://www.w3.org/">(W3C)</a></strong> - 31 Items <em>[Last       year: Second Place]</em></li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Third Place:</em></strong>&nbsp; <strong class="style114">European Telecommunications       Standards Institute</strong> <a href="http://www.etsi.org/">(ETSI)</a> - 9 items <em>[Last       year: Did not Place]</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Each  of these organizations not only performed much good work in 2005, but was also  the focus of stories that highlighted the impact that standards have on  society, or which reflected other forces acting in the marketplace, such as the  difficulty of reconciling the rights of patent holders with the standard setting  process.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                While  the W3C was not the focus of much controversy in 2005, OASIS was more than  usually in the news in 2005 as a result of two events.&nbsp; The first was its adoption of a new  intellectual property rights policy early in the year, which was intended to be  more &quot;open source friendly,&quot; but which was not as warmly welcomed in  that community as hoped (see our March 2005 issue, <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar05.php">What Does  &quot;Open&quot; Mean?</a>).&nbsp; The second  event was a story that is continuing into 2006, and involves a struggle over  the proposed adoption by the Massachusetts Executive Agencies of the  OpenDocument OASIS Format standard for archival purposes (see our September  issue, <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php">Massachusetts  and OpenDocument: the Commonwealth Leads the Way</a> and the many Standards  Blog posts that are collected <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30">here</a>).</p>
              <p class="style2"><em>[Disclosure:&nbsp; OASIS is a client of the author and his law  firm]</em></p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>2&#9658;<em>Award:</em>&nbsp;<span class="style114"> Best On-Line Coverage of ICT  Standards by an On-Line News Service </span></strong></p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>First Place: <a href="http://www.eweek.com/" class="style114">eWeek.com</a> 55       stories </strong>Items <em>[Last year: Third Place]</em></li>
                <li class="style2"><strong>Second Place:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/" class="style114">ZDNet.com</a> -</strong> 50 stories (includes       ZDNet U.S., U.K and Australia) Items <em>[Last year: Did not Place]</em></li>
                <li class="style2"><strong>Third Place:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cnet.com/" class="style114">CNET.com</a></strong> 36 Items <em>[Last       year: Second Place]</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Immediate runners-up include  InfoWorld (25), BusinessWire (20) and TechWorld (17). &nbsp;The rankings also appear to reflect in part  the number of journalists published by each news service (eWeek:&nbsp; 21; ZDNet: 19; and CNET: 20) that appreciate  the role of standards.</p>
              <p class="style2">The relative level of awareness of  standards by some news agencies in comparison to others is made more obvious by  the names and numbers of some of those services that did not rate highly, as  follows: Computerworld (13), InformationWeek (12), and IDG News Service  (10).&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                To an extent, when more than  one news service reported on the same story (as was often the case), the  rankings also reflect which article appeared most quickly.&nbsp; However, where two reports on the same story  appeared on the same day, the item i chose to list was selected on a random  basis (with the result that the effect should roughly cancel out over time &ndash; at  least among those news services that got to the Web with their stories first).</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>3</em>&#9658;<em>Award:</em>&nbsp; <span class="style114">Best Coverage of ICT Standards by an On-Line Journalist</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">                This year I would also like  to recognize the individual journalists that were most aware of the role of  standards, open source software and the organizations that create them, and  that took the time to present that role to their readers.&nbsp; As was the case with news services, while the same story was  often reported by more than one journalist, only one report was usually  included at the News portal.&nbsp; </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                
                        <li class="style2"><strong><em>First       Place: </em><span class="style114">Martin LaMonica</span></strong>- <a href="http://www.news.com/">CNET.News.com</a>- 15       Stories </li>

                        </ul>
              <h2 class="style2">II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Awards</h2>
              <p class="style2"><strong>1&#9658;<em>Award:</em> <span class="style114">Best Columnist/Blogger (Commercial)</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Online journalism has become increasing brief and  stylized, with attendant loss of value.&nbsp;  Not only are most on-line stories limited to one to two screens of text  (using whatever space is left between the advertising), but prevailing rules of  journalism dictate that a good deal of what space is available will be spent in  a very predictable way: headline, subtitle, opening sentences, expansion of  theme, quote from source consistent with story line, statement of counter  position, closing quote from source counter to story line or &quot;good closing  quote&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">The result is that while print journals abound with  longer, more analytical pieces, in-depth on-line analysis is increasingly  becoming the province of bloggers and those specialty sites that place fewer  constraints on their authors.</p>
              <p class="style2">It will be no surprise to many that as the recipient  of this first award I have selected:</p>
              <p align="center" class="style115">David Berlind (ZDNet.com)</p>
              <p class="style2">David has previously been honored by the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI), which presented him with its Presidents  Award for Journalism in 2003.&nbsp; Unlike  most journalists, he was an IT professional before becoming a professional  writer.&nbsp; His <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/">Between the Lines</a> blog (a venue shared  with co-author Dan Farber) has consistently covered not only open standards and  open source, but more recently the interplay, and sometimes clash, between  those two disciplines.&nbsp; I haven't agreed  with David on every position that he has taken (the opposite is also true), but  his commitment and passion for covering open standards and open source is  unquestioned, as has been his contribution towards bringing important issues to  light and into public dialogue.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>2&#9658;Award</em>:&nbsp; <span class="style115">Best Community Site or Blog (Non-Profit)</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Blogs  and community sites that focus on particular domains or issues have become an  increasingly important route by which news can reach the public that would  otherwise be neglected by, or unknown to, the formal media.&nbsp; In addition, many provide skilled analysis,  as well as an opportunity for additional facts and opinion to be aggregated and  consolidated.</p>
              <p class="style2">It  will (again) be no surprise to many that I would like to honor, as the  recipient of the first award in this category:</p>
              <p align="center" class="style115"><strong>Pamela Jones - <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/">Groklaw.net</a></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Almost  immediately following her first posting on May 16, 2003, Pamela has had an  enormous and loyal following.&nbsp; Her  ongoing dedication to investigative journalism in defense of Free and Open  Source Software is well-known to friend and foe (most notably, SCO) alike.&nbsp; More recently she has supported a variety of  open standards-related causes as well, including by championing the efforts of  Peter Quinn and the Information Technology Division of Massachusetts to mandate  use of the OpenDocument format by the Executive Agencies of the Commonwealth  for archival purposes.&nbsp; Pamela's  indefatigable work at Groklaw &ndash; and her less visible but equally tireless and  substantial efforts behind the scenes to marshal data, develop sources and  influence outcomes &ndash; have earned her the well-deserved respect and trust of the  entire open source community.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Conclusion:</em></strong>&nbsp; This year saw what I believe to be a noticeable increase in  standards awareness in ICT news coverage, as well as in the number of news  outlets (both general as well as technical) reporting on open source  topics.&nbsp; I hope that this trend will  continue, and take pleasure in bringing some small measure of recognition to  those services and individuals that have taken it upon themselves to acquaint  their readers with the role that these important tools play in the modern  world.</p>

              <p class="style2">2005 was a busy year at  ConsortiumInfo.org as well as in the standards world at large.&nbsp; Here are a few highlights:</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>February 16:</em></strong>&nbsp; I was pleased to announce the launch of the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/metalibrary/">Standards MetaLibrary</a> in  our <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb05.php">February issue</a>,  which was appropriately dedicated to the Study of Standards.&nbsp; What is the Standards MetaLibrary?&nbsp; Most succinctly, it is an expanding database  of categorized abstracts of serious articles (currently 1,038 in number) about  standards, in each case with links to the full text, which in most cases is  available free of charge.&nbsp; The Standards  MetaLibrary was created with the assistance of a generous grant from Sun  Microsystems.&nbsp; I described the content  of the Standards MetaLibrary in the formal <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb05.php#announcing">announcement</a> as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">The  Standards MetaLibrary is not limited to material about standards in a narrow  sense. Rather, it focuses on the importance of standards to the modern world  and their impact on society, and how they are created, and by whom. The  materials included therefore address topics such as how the standard setting  process operates, how governments support this process and utilize standards,  the economic benefits of standards uptake, legal aspects of the use (and abuse)  of standards, and many other subjects that illustrate the role of standards in  the world today.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">By  year's end, use of the MetaLibrary was exceeding 18,000 visitors a month.&nbsp; For more about what the Standards  MetaLibrary is and how to make use of it, see the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/metalibrary/faq/">FAQ page</a>.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>March 29:</em></strong>&nbsp; At the end of March, the host of this site, <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/">Gesmer Updegrove LLP,</a> hosted what the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI) called a <a href="http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=909">&quot;landmark  event&quot;</a>.&nbsp; As described in  greater detail in the ANSI press release that followed the meeting:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">A landmark event occurred in Boston,  Massachusetts, today as representatives from 21 consortia convened with members  of the voluntary consensus standards community for the largest known meeting of  the two constituencies. </p>
                <p class="style2">                Hosted by  Gesmer Updegrove LLP and organized by the <a href="http://www.ansi.org/usss">U.S.  Standards Strategy</a> (USSS) Committee, the session was held specifically for  the purpose of information sharing and soliciting input from consortia on the  draft revision of the Strategy that is currently underway. The USSS (formerly  known as the <a href="http://www.ansi.org/nss">National Standards Strategy</a>)  serves as a strategic framework to help guide standards-related activities  impacting trade, market-access, emerging national priorities and more. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                ConsortiumInfo.org publicized the  event, and I, (a member of the United States  Standards Strategy Committee), gathered most of the  representatives of the consortium community.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>June 28:</em></strong>&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/">Standards Blog</a> was  launched.&nbsp; By January 3, 2006 the 103rd  blog entry had been posted, and monthly visits to the Standards Blog were  approaching 90,000.&nbsp; Rather than a  compendium of links to the news of the day, the Standards Blog attempts to  provide in-depth analysis of important events, and to follow important stories  relevant to the world of standards as they develop.&nbsp; The Standards Blog has most thoroughly covered the evolving story  in Massachusetts relating to the adoption of <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30">open document  formats</a>, and in particular the OASIS OpenDocument format.&nbsp; Many of the most important developments in  the story were first reported in the Standards Blog, which has now been cited  as a source in more than a hundred main-stream news articles.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>August 15:</em></strong>&nbsp; I,  was presented with the <strong><em>ANSI 2005 President's Award for Journalism</em></strong>.&nbsp; As stated in the ANSI <a href="http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=1008">press  release</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><strong>Andrew  Updegrove</strong> has been awarded the  President's Award for Journalism, which recognizes outstanding journalistic  work that helps to illuminate the role that standardization and conformity  assessment activities play in improving the health and safety of Americans,  while strengthening the competitiveness of U.S. business in a global  marketplace. Mr. Updegrove acts as editor and publisher of the <em>Consortium  Standards Bulletin</em>, which offers a wealth of information on standards and  standards-setting, both online and in print. <em>The Bulletin</em> and website, <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/">ConsortiumInfo.org</a>, have helped to  raise the profile of standards and highlight their importance to commerce and  daily life, as well as encourage greater support for their use and development. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">For the last three and a  half months, I have been reporting at the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/">Standards Blog</a> on the  unfolding story of Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn's effort to adopt and  implement a policy that would ensure that important state documents will remain  available to the public indefinitely.&nbsp;  That policy mandates the use of &quot;open document format&quot;  standards by the Executive Agencies of the Commonwealth, and additionally  approves two tools for that purpose: the Adobe PDF format, and the OpenDocument  OASIS format.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">What began as a simple  effort by a responsible public servant to perform his job to the best of his  ability, unfortunately, degenerated this fall into the launching of political  attacks in the Massachusetts Senate on his authority, and to unsubstantiated  (and soon disproved) accusations regarding his personal integrity being raised  on the front page of the Boston <em>Globe.</em></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">During this same time  period, I have written a total of 52 (to date) lengthy blog entries, some  investigative, some analytical, and some informational on this story.&nbsp; The entries that begin and end this article,  and the details included in between, document, sadly, what can happen when a  dedicated public servant runs afoul of political and commercial interests that  might suffer as a result of the implementation of a useful public policy.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The first blog entry below  reports on the results of an investigation instigated by inquiries made by the  Boston <em>Globe</em>, as earlier reported <a href="http://consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1771">here</a> in an entry  entitled, &quot;City on a Hill or Tammany Hall?&quot;</p>
              <p align="center" class="style2">* * * * * * *</p>

              <p align="center" class="style2"><strong>Quinn Cleared in Travel  Investigation (But Will the <em>Globe</em> be Cleared?)</strong> </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                The Boston <em>Globe </em>reports today that Peter Quinn has been <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/12/10/review_backs_trips_by_technology_chief/">cleared</a> in an investigation into  whether his travel to trade conferences had received proper approval. The  article reads in part as follows: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style2">The  Romney administration's chief technology officer did not violate  conflict-of-interest standards or other rules when he took 12 out-of-state  trips to attend conferences during the past year without obtaining the written  approval of his boss, according to a review by the governor's budget chief&hellip;. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                Also,  Fehrnstrom said that while sponsors of many of the conferences included  computer software companies, Quinn had assured Trimarco that none of the firms  are currently state vendors or are bidding on state business.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                The article also confirms Quinn's statements that his  superior, Eric A. Kriss, who was then secretary of administration and finance,  had not only verbally approved each of the trips in advance, but had told him  that completing any paperwork in connection with the travel was unnecessary,  &quot; because he felt that the reason that the regulation had been put in  place originally -- the fiscal crisis of the mid-1990s had cut out all  state-funded travel -- had expired.&quot; It was the completion of this  paperwork (only) that had been called into question, and not the travel itself. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As noted in an <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1771">earlier entry</a> entitled &quot;City on a Hill or Tammany Hall?&quot; Massachusetts has an  opportunity to showcase its innovation in technology through Quinn's policy  proposal, or to attack the messenger as part of an internal squabble. The same  point is implied in a quote in today's <em>Globe</em>, and has been made in  letters to the Commonwealth by both IBM and Sun Microsystems: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> ''I  knew of every trip that Peter was taking, and I approved them all,&quot; Kriss  said. ''He was in demand at most of these [conferences] because of the path  towards [open format] that we were taking. People in other states were anxious  to hear about the Massachusetts experience.&quot; </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                So ends one sordid little story in the long unseemly saga of  Massachusetts politics. But the story does not answer all of the questions that  this incident raises, some of which may be much more significant than Peter  Quinn's travel documentation: what caused this fruitless inquiry to be launched  in the first place, and was the reporting of the <em>Globe</em> responsibly  conducted? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In fact, the investigation was instigated in response to  inquiries to the State Government made by the <em>Globe</em> itself, as it  reported on <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/26/romney_administration_reviewing_trips_made_by_technology_chief/">November 26</a>. Both articles were  written by <em>Globe</em> staff writer Steven Kurkjian. As noted in my earlier  City on a Hill entry, the inquiries were made by <em>Globe</em> staff writer  Steve Kurkjian concurrent with moves by Senator Pacheco and others in State  Government to curtail Quinn's ability to set rules for proper management of the  IT needs of the Executive Agencies for which he is responsible. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The questions that remain are, why did the <em>Globe</em> make  these inquiries, and did it conduct the degree of investigation prior to  reporting the story that is consistent with responsible journalism?<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  The reason these questions are relevant is because a paper  can either be the source of invaluable information that might not otherwise  come to light, or it can be used by enemies of a person &ndash; or of a policy &ndash; that  are currently under attack. When a controversy is in process, I believe that it  is incumbent upon a journalist to be especially cautious regarding sources that  can be expected to have an axe to grind, and to subject those allegations to  particular scrutiny before proceeding to make them public. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In this case, what did the <em>Globe</em> do before going to  press with the story? According to today's story, &quot;phone calls to Kriss's  home [in connection with the earlier story] seeking comment at the time were  not returned.&quot; The story does not say for how long the reporter tried to  contact him, or whether it was known whether Kriss was even in town on  Thanksgiving weekend, or why the <em>Globe</em> felt that it needed to rush the  story to print before making further efforts to learn whether it indeed had a  story to report at all. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Andy Oram, an O'Reilly Media editor did manage to reach  Kriss on the day that the first <em>Globe</em> story came out. Here's what the <em>Globe</em> reporter <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8566">would have learned</a> if he had held  his story until he was able to do the same: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                I  managed to reach Quinn's former boss, Eric Kriss, which the Globe did not.  (Choosing to break a story over Thanksgiving weekend, when protagonists are on  vacation and government offices that could answer questions are closed,  definitely does not contribute to clarity.) Kriss, whom I know because he's  contacted me with a book idea earlier, pointed out that: </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">                - Most of Quinn's trips occurred after Massachusetts made  the decision to adopt OpenDocument. There is no possibility that the trips  would influence the decision that had already been made. <br>
                                  <br>
                    - While some two-way communication occurs at any conference--and is beneficial  to the public--the primary purpose of the trips were to let Massachusetts  government tell the rest of the world what it was doing. <br>
                                  <br>
                    - Far from being junkets, these trips were normally squeezed in on weekends  around his normal duties and represented a contribution of his free time to the  community. </p>
                </blockquote>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In other words, the reporter would have learned exactly what  the investigation would learn: that there had been no impropriety, and that  there was no story to report. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The more troubling question is, why did Kurkjian wake up one  morning and decide to look into Quinn's travel documentation at all, among all  of the other stories and areas of inquiry available to him at that time? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">That's something I'd very much like to know. As it happens,  the <em>Globe</em>, like a number of other papers, has an ombudsman, and his name  is <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/ombudsman/chacon_bio/">Richard Chac&oacute;n</a>. His email address  is ombud@globe.com, and his number is (617)929-3020; he also has a separate  voicemail number: (617)939-3022. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Today I sent him the following questions by email: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Dear Mr. Chac&oacute;n: </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">I refer you to two stories  by Steve Kurkjian, one appearing on November 26 and one on December 9, relating  to the travel documentation of Peter Quinn, the CIO of the Commonwealth.  Currently, as reported by the <em>Globe</em> in several stories, Mr. Quinn, and a  policy that his department, the Information Technology Division, are being  criticized by Senator Pacheco, Secretary Galvin and Microsoft, among others.  They are also being applauded by a large number of people, companies and  governments around the world. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In the first of the two  stories I refer to above, titled <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/26/romney_administration_reviewing_trips_made_by_technology_chief/">Romney administration reviewing trips made by  technology chief</a>, Mr. Kurkjian reports that he made inquiries into  the travel of Peter Quinn which resulted in an investigation being launched by  the State into the same topic. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In the second story, titled <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/12/10/review_backs_trips_by_technology_chief/">Review backs trips by technology chief No  conflict found for aide</a>, also by Mr. Kurkjian, Mr. Quinn is reported  to have been cleared. The article also reports that he was cleared through the  testimony of a person, Eric Kriss, who Mr. Quinn had told Mr. Kurkjian prior to  November 26 could substantiate his story. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Mr. Kurkjian, however, went  to press over the Thanksgiving weekend with a story that was damaging to Mr.  Quinn's reputation before meeting with success in reaching Mr. Kriss. Had he  done so, as indicated by today's story, he would have found that there was no  need for an investigation, and indeed, no story to report at all. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Given the controversy  surrounding the possible displacement of Microsoft products by the policy that  Mr. Quinn proposed, I believe that it is important for you to address the  following questions, in order to determine whether the <em>Globe</em> was used by  opponents of Mr. Quinn or his policy to pursue the ends of any such opponents,  and if so, whether the <em>Globe</em> followed appropriate journalistic practices  in order to avoid this outcome: </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">1.&nbsp; Did Mr. Kurkjian decide to look into Mr.  Quinn's travel on his own, or was this suggested to him by someone? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">2.&nbsp; If there was a source, who was that source? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">3. If there was a source,  was that source inside the Massachusetts government or outside? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">4.&nbsp; If the source was inside the government,  were the disclosures made to Mr. Kurkjian made in violation of any State  policy? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">5. If the source was  outside the government, did the source have any affiliations that would lead  him or her to have an interest in the disparagement of Mr. Quinn? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">6.&nbsp; Why did Mr. Kurkjian not wait to run the  story until he was able to reach Mr. Kriss, who Mr. Kurkjian knew could confirm  or disprove the basis for the story? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">7. Was this story, and the  investigation behind it, in compliance with the <em>Globe's</em> policies? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Given the importance of the  information technology policy that underlies this story, which is literally  being watched from around the world and has generated hundreds of articles in  the world press, I hope that you will undertake to answer these questions. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">By way of disclosure, I  have been reporting on this story for several months at my blog, and have  reproduced this letter there in an entry that will be read by thousands of  visitors over the next several days.

                <p align="left" class="style2">                Mr.  Updegrove, </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                Greetings and many thanks for your  detailed note. I think you raise some reasonable questions about the Globe's  stories concerning Peter Quinn (I had many of the same ones when I read  Saturday's story that he was cleared in the investigation). </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                I don't have immediate answers for  you (or your blog readers, many of whom have sent their own similar notes after  having read your page). I can tell you at the outset that Stephen Kurkjian is  one of the most experienced, professional and ethical journalists that I have  ever known. Nevertheless, I do believe that some of these questions deserve  answers - from Steve and his editors. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                I have already sent a note to Steve  asking for a chance to talk about the stories. I will offer a more detailed  reply when I have some answers. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">On Christmas Eve, Peter Quinn sent an email to all of  his employees, telling them that he would resign as the CIO of Massachusetts,  effective January 9, 2006.&nbsp; His email  read in part as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                Over the last several months, we have been through some very  difficult and tumultuous times. Many of these events have been very disruptive  and harmful to my personal well being, my family and many of my closest  friends. This is a burden I will no longer carry.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">It is also readily apparent that I have become a  lightning rod with regard to any IT initiative. Even the smallest initiatives  are being&nbsp; mitigated or stopped by some  of the most unlikely and often uniformed parties. I view these circumstances  quite troubling because the good work laid out by the IT Commission is slowly  being strangled and brought to a halt. And the last thing I can let happen is  my presence be the major contributing factor in marginalizing the good work of  ITD and the entire IT Community.</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">News of Peter's resignation was first reported on December 27 by me at  the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1863">Standards  Blog</a> and by Pamela Jones at <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051227113652154">Groklaw</a>.&nbsp; In my entry, I reported:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style2">According to Kriss, who met with Quinn on December 21st, the personal  attacks, and especially the unfounded (and quickly disproven) charges  publicized by the Boston <em>Globe</em>, played a major part in reaching his  decision.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The articles in the press that followed largely focused on the impact  that Peter Quinn's resignation would have on the fortunes of the OpenDocument  format and its proponents, and whether or not Governor Romney, widely assumed  to be grooming himself for a run for the presidency, would withdraw his support  for ODF in favor of the XML Reference Schema that Microsoft had offered to  ECMA, a European standards body, in response to the success of ODF.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In response, I posted the following entry at my blog.</p>

              <p align="center" class="style2"><em>The best way to predict the  future is to invent it.</em><br>
                - Computer scientist and visionary Alan Kay</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><br>
                For  the last three and a half months I've been covering the ongoing debate and, for  want of a better phrase, &quot;related events&quot; surrounding the decision by  the Information Technology Division of Massachusetts (ITD) to mandate use of  the OpenDocument format (ODF) for archiving Executive Agency documents. The architect  and public spokesperson for that policy has been Peter Quinn, the head of the  ITD, and the CIO of the Commonwealth. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                Like  everyone else who has been covering this story, whether on one side or the  other, I've felt free to use Peter's name and report on his actions as if they  were public property. Which, in a way, is what one's name and actions become &ndash;  even legally, as regards the threshold for proving libel -- when one accepts a  public position. And while I have invariably been complimentary, and even protective  (in the case of the <em>Globe</em> article questioning his travel records), I've  never asked Peter's permission to keep putting his name out there, day after  day and week after week, thereby doing my small bit to help keep him pinned  down at the center of a controversy. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                Now,  as you know, Peter has decided to resign his position, in part to permit the  work of the ITD to move on unhindered, and in part to allow his and his  family's life to do the same thing. I can't begrudge him the decision, but I'm  very sorry to see him go, especially as a result of the reasons that led to  that decision. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                I  can't say that I know Peter. I've interviewed him once, heard him speak or  testify three times, and exchanged a few brief emails with him over the past  several months. But I have admired him, and I'd like to take a few minutes to  say why. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                First  of all, I've been working with standards organizations for 18 years, and those  organizations have created hundreds of ITC standards during that period. But  most of those standards, while important, were not significant in any larger  sense. Most were simply the cleverly created tools that were needed to take the  next incremental step in the march of technical progress.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                ODF,  though, is a standard that <em>matters</em>, even though very few people yet  appreciate it. Unless ODF (or another mechanism capable of achieving the same  end) becomes universally adopted, much of the information of today's world will  not only fade from view as time passes &ndash; it may literally disappear for all  practical purposes, leaving little or no trace. Peter not only realized this,  but he committed to do something about it. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                Second,  I've always admired the leaders and visionaries that see things before the rest  of us, and have the courage to show the way. It's both risky and lonely to be  out in front. The enemies, doubters and flaks always outnumber the friends and  those that &quot;get it,&quot; and too often it's those that follow that get  the credit rather than those that took the heat. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                And  finally, I've always admired people who did the right thing simply because it  was the right thing to do, regardless of whether it would be easy or hard,  popular or controversial, personally beneficial or costly to one's career.  There are all too few of us that ever rise to that challenge, especially (it  seems) in public life. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                Unfortunately,  I and others in the blogosphere and the traditional media will need to mention  Peter a bit longer, as the consequences of his resignation play out. I hope  that he will understand and not begrudge our actions too much, in hopes that  his goals will be more likely to be achieved as a result. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                But  we should keep it short. It's the least we can do for someone who expected no  personal benefit from doing something that needed to be done for the benefit of  all, and who took the fall for doing so &ndash; not because what he wanted to do was  wrong, but because what was good for all was threatening to a few, and because  those few were powerful. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                So  as Peter steps back from the spotlight, I'd like to express my gratitude to  him, and wish him well. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                To  everyone else, I'd like to suggest that the best thing we can do for Peter is  to give him some peace and privacy. And we should do everything we can to  achieve what he set in motion - for our benefit as well as in recognition of  his efforts. It's the least we can do for someone who tried to make a  difference &ndash; and did. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">                So  thanks, Peter. Hail and farewell. </p>

              <p class="style2">What has come to be known as the &quot;blogosphere&quot; has now been in  existence long enough to spawn  untold millions upon millions of personal  Websites, each of which presents the thoughts and observations of its  individual author.&nbsp; As one might expect, those  thoughts and observations are (to say the least) varied.&nbsp; To enter into the blogosphere is therefore  to enter into the very collective consciousness of humanity.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Which can be a rather disorienting experience, especially if as one  looks in, one sees one's own self looking back.&nbsp; Or, worse yet, someone looking back that doesn't look like them at all, but who someone else suggests <em>is</em> them.</p>
              <p class="style2">                As happened to me a few days ago, as recorded in my blog.&nbsp; Consider this&hellip;</p>
              <p align="center" class="style2">                * * * * * * *</p>
              <p class="style2">New Years Day weekend is not a time favored by those publicists that would toss  their news into the pond of public awareness (unless they wish their news to  disappear quickly, leaving as few public ripples as possible).&nbsp; There being little worthwhile news to report, this post will  therefore not deal with the news of the day. </p>
              <p class="style2">                For  the same ripple reason, I will instead use this opportunity to reveal a  startling personal fact. </p>
              <p class="style2">                I  have learned, through a seemingly reliable source, that I am actually <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Archive/0,5673,-13,00.html%20">Simon Hoggart</a>, London <em>Guardian</em> political columnist and BBC Radio 4 personality. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Could  this indeed be so, you ask?&nbsp; Yes,  although it came as a complete shock to me as well. Although I have lived in  England in the past and read the <em>Guardian</em> on many occasions, I was  heretofore unaware that I had not only read, but written, some of what I had  previously enjoyed.</p>
              <p class="style2">                This  state of pleasant ignorance ended when an alert reader brought a certain blog  post to my attention. That entry was posted by one Jon Levell in his thought  provoking blog, <a href="http://www.coralbark.net/blog/">Irregular Verbiage</a>, aptly  subtitled (the most recent entry is dated November 24th), &quot;Sporadic  Musings.&quot; </p>
              <p class="style2">                It  seems that in that most recent Musing, Jon was disposed to muse over the  Massachusetts Open Document saga. But his musing did not stop there. Instead,  he culminated with this final, coy muse: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                In  other news, if you are obsessively reading info on the debate about open  standards (and specifically whether public organisations like the government of  Massachusetts or the European Commission should mandate that their employees  use then) then a key source of info is the Standards Blog. What I find most  intriguing is that you never see the Standards Blog's Andy Updegrove and the  Guardian's/Radio 4's Simon Hoggart in a room together. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="center"><img src="http://www.coralbark.net/blogphotos/newsquiz_hoggart.jpg" alt="hoggart" width="247" height="165"></p>
              <p class="style2">Hmm.  He had a point. To the best of my knowledge, I <em>had</em> never been seen in  the same room as Guardian/Radio 4's Simon Hoggart; at least, to be objective,  unless I <em>was</em> Simon Hoggart. </p>
              <p class="style2">                While  some (Microsoft Office spokesman Alan Yates Microsoft springs to mind) might  question my objectivity, in fact I have tried to be scrupulously objective in  my reporting of facts and in any analysis of legal language that I offer on  line, while preserving the right to express the opinions that I form as a  result of what I observe. I strive to maintain a reputation for objectivity not  only for its own sake, but in order that my opinions will be given credibility  and weight, as well as the facts I report. </p>
              <p class="style2">                I  therefore take it as obligatory that I investigate Mr. Levell's disturbing  suggestion that I am &quot;Guardian/Radio 4's Simon Hoggart&quot;, rather than  mild-mannered Massachusetts attorney and standards wonk Andy Updegrove. After all, perhaps  the greatest test of objectivity begins when one looks into the mirror.&nbsp; Moreover, I shall  do so with as much diligence as I would a contention that Mr. Yates (for  example) is in fact Presidential Press Secretary Scott McClellan (perhaps I'll  return to that intriguing possibility in a future blog entry). </p>
              <p class="style2">                With  this as prelude, here are the significant facts that I have uncovered, as well  as my ultimate conclusion on the question, after balancing all ambiguities against  my own sense of identity: </p>
              <p class="style2">                1.  Mr. Hoggart was born on May 26, 1946. I was born on November 9, 1953. Close  enough for government work. </p>
              <p class="style2">                2.  Mr. Hoggart has an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4051777.stm">entry</a> in the Wikipedia, and I do not.  Pure coincidence, or careful research on the part of the Wikipedia staff,  notwithstanding the recent challenges to the accuracy of the on-line  encyclopedia? </p>
              <p class="style2">                3.  According to that same entry, Mr. Hoggart is alleged to have had a brief affair  with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4051777.stm">Kimberly Quinn</a>. I do not recall  ever&hellip;ahem, being in the same room as Ms. Quinn, but, on the other hand, I have  no recollection of ever being in the same room as Mr. Hoggart, so these two  pieces of data appear to cancel each other out. </p>
              <p class="style2">                4.  Mr. Hoggart chairs BBC 4's weekly show, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/newsquiz.shtml">The News Quiz</a>, a delightfully  erudite, humorous and occasionally pedantic show which I have often enjoyed. I  have some small pretensions to being both erudite and humorous, while my  partners regularly assure me that I am pedantic in the extreme. </p>
              <p class="style2">5.  Mr. Hoggart is the author of, among other works, a compendium of absurd  Christmas Letters, titled <a href="http://www.westminsterbookshop.co.uk/images/475/1843544741.jpg">The Hamster that Loved Puccini</a>. I  am forced to admit that I am fully capable of giving (and perhaps have given)  such a name to a book, should I ever write/have already written one. </p>
              <p class="style2">                6.  I have not been able to contact Mr. Hoggart by telephone to put the question to  him/me, but each time I placed the call, <em>his phone was invariably busy!</em> </p>
              <p class="style2">                But  enough of this. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Clearly,  I have been unable to disprove the suggestion of Mr. Levell that I am one and  the same with the Guardian's/Radio 4's Simon Hoggart. Therefore, resolving all  doubts against my own bias that I am, at least in this regard, unique, and  assuming that Mr. Levell is a responsible practitioner of the blogging trade  and has some evidence to support his implied allegation, I must, with regret,  surrender my identity. So be it. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Finally,  a note to Mr. Levell. </p>
              <p class="style2">                I  see from the CV that you have posted at your site that you have earned a Ph.D  in Theoretical Particle Physics. Having myself (or, as the case may be, Mr.  Hoggart's self) at best only a muddled and imperfect knowledge of quantum  theory, perhaps you can explain, for Simon's and my benefit and in the manner  of the late lamented Douglas Adams, the seeming duality of existence that  I/he/we/whoever are currently experiencing. Or, as the question was more  succinctly put by the <a href="http://www.firesigntheatre.com/funway.html">Firesign Theatre</a>, in their 1969  appreciation album, <a href="http://www.whyaduck.com/cards/all-hail.jpg">All Hail Marx [and] Lennon</a>,  &quot;How can you be in two places at once, when you're not anywhere at  all?&quot; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Mr.  Levell, Simon's and/or my identity are at your mercy. We await your response. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Please muse on that. </p>
