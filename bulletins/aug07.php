			<p>In centuries past, colonial powers used the cheap labor provided by their new subjects to extract resources, and their new colonies as captive markets for their own manufactured goods. Today, similar results can be achieved with much less effort when royalty bearing patent claims are embedded in the standards for products such as DVD players and cellular phones.  If the royalties are high enough, the patent owners can have such products built in emerging countries using cheap local labor, and sell them there and globally under their own brands.  Meanwhile, emerging company manufacturers can't afford to build similar products at all. Governments in developed nations should use their purchasing power to impede, rather than support, such "standards based neocolonialism."<br /><a class="pdf" href="http://consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/pdf/aug07/aug07_feature.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>

			<h4>EDITOR'S NOTE:</h4>
			<!-- <h3>STANDARDS AND THE ENVIRONMENT</h3> -->
			<h3>Changing Times/Time for Changes</h3>
			<p>The current standards infrastructure has its roots not just in the last century, but in the one before. Over the last 125 years or so, that structure has been through some changes, such as the founding of global standards bodies like ISO, IEC and the ITU. More recently, the information and communication technology (ICT) industries have seen the formation of the hundreds of consortia that now provide the majority of ICT standards.</p>
			<p>All of these changes, however, have been accomplished largely at the behest of stakeholders in the developed nations.</p>
			<p>Does that matter?</p>
			<p>In this issue, I suggest that it does, and explore whether the structure that has evolved to meet the standardization requirements of the First World is adequate to meet the needs of the rest of humanity, and in particular of the rapidly emerging economies of China and India, among other nations.</p>
			<p>I begin this discussion in my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>, where I highlight the disproportionate advantage that the corporations headquartered in long-developed nations enjoy over those based in developing nations as they seek to make their way into the global marketplace. In particular, I focus on the formidible patent portfolios owned by the traditional market leaders, and the prospect for a succession of international standards wars unless greater emphasis is placed on adoption of royalty-free standards by the ICT industry.</p>
			<p>In this month's <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong>, I expand on this inquiry by analogizing the current situation to the colonialism of the past. In prior times, developed nations extracted resources from the colonies that they seized, and also used their colonies as captive markets into which they could sell European goods. Today, a sort of patent-based neocolonialism allows the corporations in developed nations to subcontract manufacturing to factories in developing countries. There, inexpensive labor can produce inexpensive products which can then be sold at a healthy markup both locally and around the world under the brand of the foreign patent owner. Meanwhile, high standards-related royalties effectively bar the same factories from selling similar products under their own brands. The results are predictable, and I suggest a number of ways in which the rules might be changed to level the playing field to the benefit of all.</p>
			<p>I provide a specific example of these predictable results in my <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection, which focuses on a Chinese "home grown" (and patented) document standard called the Unified Office Format. That standard has been created in order to permit and promote the development of office productivity software by Chinese companies, in order to take marketshare from Microsoft's dominant Office suite.</p>
			<p>I complete this issue on a lighter note with the usual <strong><em>Consider This…</em></strong> column, which departs from the serious study of this world to look at the increasingly popular realm of virtual worlds. Or perhaps I haven't left the study of our world at all.</p>
			<p>In any event, I invite you with this issue to see once again how the world in which we live is one increasingly interconnected community. Even in the world of standards, we are reminded that what benefits us most is what benefits us all.</p>
			<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this issue.</p>

			<!-- <h3>THE "LANDLORD'S MAN" AND THE CONSERVATION<br />OF NATURAL RESOURCES</h3> -->
			<h3>It's Time for IPR Equal Opportunity<br />in International Standard Setting</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>Standards occupy what may be a unique niche at the intersection of society, government, commerce and opportunity. That's because safety, health and technical standards of all types touch every aspect of our daily lives. One would think that governments would therefore take great interest in how they are developed and deployed. Curiously enough, however, they largely don't. While this largely hands off attitude has worked reasonably well in the past, the increasing importance of technology in the modern day world may be introducing us to an era when international standards wars will become more common, unless efforts are undertaken now to level the playing field.</p>
			<p>How disconnected are governments? In some nations (such as the United States), government involvement is largely at the technical committee participation level, rather than as an overseer or accreditor. And with the exception of a few organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union (which operates under the aegis of the United Nations), the bodies that globally adopt standards are non-governmental entities rather than than treaty organizations as well.</p>
			<p>This is rather surprising, because despite the nominal status as technical specifications, standards can provide commercial and social benefits at many levels that would not be otherwise attainable. At the global level, standards are capable of creating markets for new products and services that would not otherwise exist. For those in developing nations, telecommunications standards (for example) can bring educational and other benefits that would be impossible to provide absent the existence and broad adoption of standards-based technologies. For vendors as a group, standards can lower risk while expanding opportunties. And when the implementation of a standard infringes upon a patent, the singular owner of that patent may gain great monetary and other advantages as a result.</p>
			<p>This ability of a single patent owner to influence so powerful a tool has always been problematic, and the rules of national and sectoral standard setting organizations, as well as those of global standards bodies like ISO, IEC and the ITU, have therefore sought to balance the rights of the property owner with the benefits to be gained from standards. Less well recognized, however, is the impact that classes of patent owners can have over other classes that are "patent poor." The most obvious impact can be found in the ability of developed nations to benefit from the standardization process to a disproportionate extent when compared to developing countries.</p>
			<p>The advantages of developed nations are many in this regard. The corporations headquartered within their boundaries are often powerful and multinational, with long traditions of research and development, as well as legal staffs trained to globally protect the intellectual property rights that these corporations create. The patent portfolios so accumulated provide assets that can be bartered in cross licensing transactions with the other well established companies that are their main competitiors. The result is that smaller domestic, as well as emerging foreign competitors, are at a competitive disadvantage, and can find it difficult or impossible to enter the markets that the incumbents have come to dominate.</p>
			<p>Well established companies are also more adept at participating in standard setting activities, whether they be hosted by consortia, national standards bodies, or <em>de jure</em> global organizations. Many national governments, especially in regions such as Europe, recognize the international trade advantages that can be gained through effective participation in such activities, and incorporate standards strategy into their international trade policies. Global treaties, such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade under the the World Trade Organization, have also been drafted to prevent individual nations from erecting standards-based barriers intended to keep foreign goods from gaining access to domestic markets.</p> 
			<p>Today, information and communications technology (ICT) is becoming increasingly important in many ways. Not only does the revenue attributable to ICT products and services constitute an ever larger percentage of the global economy, but new job creation and the economic advantages that accompany such jobs form one of the greatest areas of opportunity for emerging and developing nations alike. But because most technology is patentable, many of the standards that must be created to realize the full potential of technological innovations will inevitably infringe upon patent claims. And therein lies the rub.</p>
			<p>Because the corporations headquartered in developed nations are more likely to protect their new technology on a global basis and to participate most heavily in the standard setting process, these vendors are gaining significant, long term commercial advantages over their existing and potential competitors in developing nations. Due to the short life span of technology and the long-term monopoly granted by a patent, these advantages will be far reaching, and will replicate through successive generations of technology until the businesses based in emerging countries become similarly adept.</p>
			<p>The result, as explored in greater depth in the feature article of this issue, is the likelihood that we will face more and more standards wars between opposing vendor factions based in developed and developing nations. Already, China is creating multiple "home grown" standards in order to level the playing field in product areas typified by heavy royalty requirements tied to globally adopted standards. Chinese companies and universities are also dramatically increasing the filing of patents.</p>
			<p>Such actions are understandable and predictable under current circumstances. Simply tightening up the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade would not appear to be the answer, as this would simply institutionalize the advantage of developed nations over developing countries, and would likely prove to be ineffective in any event. Nor does a spiral into mutually assured patent destruction through an increasing blizzard of global patent filings appear to be the right answer, either.</p>
			<p>Instead, I suggest that the time has come for ISO, IEC and ITU, as well as for governments in general, to act to readjust the balance between the rights of intellectual property rights owners and those of standards implementers and end users. If standards bodies were to change their policies to require disclosure of patents and licensing terms at an earlier point in the standards development process, fewer royalty bearing standards would result. And if governments limited their purchasing to products that comply with royalty-free standards, then there would be greater incentives for patent owners to settle for the other benefits that can accompany inclusion of their technology in a standard in addition to royalties.</p>
			<p>Absent such changes in policy, globalization will doubtless become an even more contentious process than it already is. And those in the developing world will have one more justification to accuse those in developed nations that they are too focused on their own own welfare, to the disadvantage of those that are still struggling to share in the benefits of the modern world.</p>

			<h3>OOXML, ODF and UOF: What's Up in China?</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<h6>Date: August 17 2007<br /><span class="views">Views: 2,209</span></h6>
			<img class="imgright" src="/images/chinese_flag.gif" alt="" width="50" height="50" border="0" />
			<p>Microsoft has seemed to be flying high in the Peoples Republic of China lately. Bill Gates spent several days in Beijing earlier this year in meetings with high-level officials, after hosting Chinese President Hu Jintao the spring before at Gate's own home. And legitimate copies of Microsoft products appear to be at last gaining ground in comparison to pirated copies, albeit at the price of discounting them to almost unimaginable levels (students can now reportedly obtain a <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/carroll/?p=1731">Windows/Office bundle</a> for the incredible price of $3). Some commentators complimented Microsoft's pragmatic decision to accept Chinese realities and not insist on having everything its own way.</p>
			<p>Others, though, wonder whether the Chinese are smiling all the way to the bank, taking everything they can get, and giving little in return. David Kirkpatrick asked that question in the title of his April Fortune piece, titled <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/07/23/100134488/">How Microsoft conquered China: Or is it the other way around?</a> Kirkpatrick hitched a ride on Gates' April trip to Beijing, and witnessed the rock star status and high level access Gates enjoyed in the Chinese capital. In the end, Kirkpatrick concluded that both sides are doing just fine, thank you, even if China may be doing a bit "finer."</p>
			<p>But perhaps not. One story I've been following in China for some time is the development of China's own home-grown open document format standard, called UOF (for Unified Office Format). Now, two stories involving UOF, OOXML (a Microsoft-backed XML format that is currently seeking adoption in ISO/IEC JTC1) and ODF (an already ISO/IEC JTC1-adopted XML format that is backed by IBM and Sun, among others) have appeared in the last ten days in the English language version of the state-owned Xinhua news service. Together, they provide an interesting temperature reading on the warmth of the Redmond-Beijing relationship. (You can read more about UOF <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20061122040402230">here</a> and <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20061122040402230">here</a>.)</p>
			<p>First, some background. China has embarked upon a very aggressive state-sponsored, and state funded, standards strategy. That strategy is staffed by a multitude of government and academic employees, with estimates of their total number running into the many thousands. At the heart of the matter is an understandable resentment by China to be relegated to the status of a low-cost, low margin job shop for Western, patent-owning companies that have their products built in China, and then mark them up significantly for sale all over the world. China is barred from selling similar products by the high patent licensing fees that it would need to pay to sell such products under it's own brand. The best example can be found in DVD players, where the licensing fees would be almost equal to the retail price of a low end unit.</p> 
			<p>As a result, China has evolved a two-pronged approach: use western standards with abandon, when they can be implemented for free, and develop its own standards in select, high volume areas, such as wireless technology, 3G telephones &mdash; and office suite formats - when they can't. UOF was adopted as a Chinese National Standard in May of this year, and implementers will need to obtain a license to multiple Chinese patents in order to implement it.</p>
			<p>In short, Microsoft is facing a situation in China analogous to what it is facing with ODF. Except in this case, it is dealing not with a handful of vendors, most with a tiny fraction of Microsoft's own resources, but with a sovereign nation with the largest population on earth, a determined and powerful central government, and national standards strategy.</p>
			<p>Microsoft's own strategy in the face of UOF has been similar to its approach to ODF. In April, Microsoft <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/07/23/100134488/">announced</a> that it would fund the creation of an <a href="http://uof-translator.sourceforge.net/">open source translator project</a> intended to enable UOF to OOXML document exchanges. eWEEK.com's Peter Galli quoted Jean Paoli, Microsoft's general manager for interoperability and XML architecture as follows: "This Open XML-UOF translator will be similar to the Open XML-ODF translator that has already been developed and will follow the same model." Microsoft presumably hoped that this approach would assuage the Chinese government, just as it hoped its ODF translator project would comfort European antitrust regulators.</p>
			<p>That hope appears not to be maturing at the moment in the case of OOXML. Or at least so the tea leaves at People's Daily Online would indicate, as this is where China shows the English speaking world what it wishes it to see online. The first of the two articles, titled <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/90858/90864/6233599.html">Microsoft 'monopoly' comes under fire</a>, is brief, and appeared on August 7. It states in part:</p>
			<blockquote>Chinese academics and software developers gathered in Beijing yesterday to voice their opposition to Microsoft's latest standard document format Office Open XML (OOXML). Major software developers, academics and industry associations spoke out against Microsoft's "monopoly" on the format of digital documents….[Microsoft's] document format has helped it to unprecedented success, setting a formidable barrier for other software companies, who must make Microsoft-compatible products and cannot access the core code of the format.</blockquote>
			<p>The article goes on to quote Ni Guangnan, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, as follows: "Microsoft's move to make its OOXML format the international standard is an extension of its goal to maintain its monopoly in the world's software market. We are calling on the government to veto the OOXML format at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)."   According to the article, Ni wrote an open letter to Chinese Media on July 17, which Tim Chen, senior vice-president of Microsoft and chairman and CEO of its China operation, answered on July 31. Chen called Ni's assertions "unfair," and continued, "We are promoting the new format in response to our users' needs."</p>
			<p>I was not sure how much to make of this single article, notwithstanding its posting at the state information agency's English news site, given its brevity and the fact that its quotes were attributed to a single "academic." Chinese news stories make statements to the world, and how &mdash; and by whom &mdash; those statements are made are intended to signal the seriousness with which they should be taken.</p>
			<p>The next article appeared on August 13, and this article was not only more forceful, but quoted several industry sources. It was titled <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/13/content_6523467.htm">Microsoft doc standard meets opposition in China</a>, and runs to almost 900 words &mdash; quite long for a People's Daily Online article. The article begins as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>BEIJING, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- The OOXXML, Microsoft's newest document standard, is facing growing opposition as China's software producers, IT experts and netizens continue to urge the government to vote against it at the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) conference in September.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"An international standard can't be built on the private technologies of a single company. If something goes wrong with the company, nobody can open files based on its standard," said Co-Create Software (CCS) vice secretary general Yang Chuanyan.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"We appreciate the sophisticated technologies of the MS document, but doc standard has to be open to allow anybody, at anytime, to develop applications to operate on the saved files," Yang said.</blockquote>
			<p>The article goes on to note that Microsoft has already developed a converter able to convert documents based on ODF, a "standard promoted by Sun Microsystems, IBM and Oracle and approved as the international standard by the ISO," and that it is working with Chinese partners on a similar solution.</p>
			<p>But that solution does not seem to be working any better in China than it is elsewhere. The article goes on to quote not just Ni again, but also Beijing Redflag CH2000 Software Co. Ltd. manager Hu Caiyong, who states, "The MS doc standard contains too many MS patents, which we have to get round and re-develop new protocols for compatibility. It took almost five years for Chinese software producers to develop software that is compatible with MS Office."</p>
			<p>The article also quotes a vice president of Evermore Software, another Chinese company: "The MS will seize the entire market during our research and development period. Which means the fledging domestic producers will be destroyed and consumers will have few options," and an Executive Vice President of China Standard Software, who was also critical.</p>
			<p>Intriguingly, it returns to Ni and Hu on the subject of bringing UOF and ODF into harmony, a goal called for by <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070417025728436&amp;">Sun's Scott McNealy</a> in Beijing earlier this year:</p>
			<blockquote>Ni said that the UOF and the ODF should combine to fight the OOXML since the two standards have a significant integration potential as 70 percent of them are the same and 20 percent of them are transferable.   "Although the MS Office has more than 400 million users globally, users of Star Office and Open Office, software based on ODF, have reached tens of millions worldwide," Hu Caiyong told Xinhua….</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"Considering the potential Chinese market and the maturity of the self-developed software, the integration of the UOF and the ODF is quite realistic and able to gather enough strength to fight the OOXML," Hu said.</blockquote>
			<p>Apparently, OOXML has struck a popular nerve as well. The article says, "Enter 'resist', 'Microsoft' and 'document standard' in Baidu, the largest search engine for the Chinese language, 112,000 web pages will show up."</p>
			<p>It should be noted that the article also quotes the Secretary General of the China Software Association, who called OOXML "a very good thing" for China to vote in favor of OOXML, and something that would be good for both the government as well as Chinese software vendors. Xinhua states that it was unable to obtain a statement from the Ministry of Information Industry, which will cast China's vote on OOXML</p>
			<p>What to make of all this? Is the government signaling that its vote can't be taken for granted? Are there concessions that it is asking for from Microsoft behind the scenes? Which way will China ultimately vote?</p>

			<h3><span class="red">#50</span> Standards, Virtual Worlds and The Big Question</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>It was not so long ago that most kids in school experienced a predictable "Oh Wow!" moment when they learned about atomic structure (that's "Oh Wow!" as in, "What if our solar system is, like, you know, just an 'atom' in this, like, really big 'molecule' thing called a galaxy and…").</p>
			<p>Today, of course, that Oh Wow! moment is more likely to be sparked by a video game or, more recently, a visit to a virtual world. And after all, the basis for the old <em>Oh Wow!</em> Concept was crumbling anyway, what with the discovery of subatomic particles, and the assumption that there's no physical "there" there at all &mdash; just electronic charges. Or whatever. Personally, I've always found the video game day dream more appealing than the atomic theory in any case. After all &mdash; how much difference is there really between what happens when you turn on a computer monitor and the Big Bang? <em>Oh Wow!</em></p>
			<p>The old concept of life as being something other than what we suppose returned to me just now when I read at Bob Sutor's <a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/?p=1678">Open Blog</a> about a Virtual Worlds Conference held at MIT on June 15 (you can view the agenda for the event at Bob's blog <a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/?p=1678">here</a>, and find a live blog entry at Virtual Worlds News on a panel that Bob moderated <a href="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2007/06/liveblogging_mi_3.html">here</a>). And yes, there's (of course) a standards hook in here somewhere.</p>
			<p>You'll find the standards connection in a related article (catchily titled <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/06/12/Standards-will-help-users-keep-virtual-clothes-on_1.html">Standards to help users keep virtual clothes on</a>).  In that article, IDG's China Martens interviews Sutor in advance of the Virtual Worlds Conference. Given that Bob is not only a recently hooked virtual world fan but the chief standards and open source strategist at IBM as well, he had a few thoughts about why virtual worlds need standards. For example, the article includes this:</p>
			<blockquote>"A lot of people are looking at Second Life and saying, 'Let's do one of those,'" said Bob Sutor…. "The last thing you want is a lot of different ways to do the same things. You need standards for how to teleport between different virtual worlds and to bring objects with you." …Besides an avatar's clothes, those objects could include the money it was using in your home virtual world as well as a presentation you might want to share with your colleagues or potential customers.</blockquote> 
			<p>Hmm. Sounds like a real problem you'd want to tackle - who (with the possible exception of Paris Hilton) would want to arrive in a room full of people unannounced with no money and no clothes, even virtually? But as virtual worlds get fine-tuned to this degree, the old "Oh Wow! What if…?" question may be moving from the fun to the mildly uncomfortable.</p>
			<p>Why uncomfortable? Well, have you ever noticed that no one has a clue what or why gravity is? We observe and measure its effect and try and fit it into a Grand Theory of Everything, but let's face it - we haven't got a clue what "it" really is. "It" just "is." Full Stop. In trying to quantify it and fit it into some logical relationship to other (equally unknowable) strong and weak forces, it's easy to forget that we haven't even a tentative theory to explain <em>what</em> or <em>why</em> gravity "is" at all.</p>
			<p>Or how about mathematics? Math doesn't exist in any sense other than that physical objects often seem to be better at it than many of us are - and it always works. Always. Now why exactly would that be?</p>
			<p>If an explanation for the existence of gravity cannot even be imagined, then perhaps we are left with the conclusion that gravity is simply the manifestation of a rule or standard, to which the world we observe is required to comply. In fact, making the assumption that the world is governed by <em>rules</em> instead of <em>laws</em> helps solve a lot of puzzles.</p>
			<p>After all, Newtonian physics work, but not all the time. When you get down to the realm of the really small, then you have to pull out a different rule book (the quantum physics one) to explain why things happen the way they seem to.  And how about that pesky Dark Matter? (That's "dark" like the color of fudge &mdash; as in "fudge factor.")  If all physics is just a collection of imposed and not too rigid rules rather than the observable and inviolable physical laws we think we observe in action, then we never have to figure out where all that Dark Matter is hiding.  It becomes just another "known issue" that the programmer fudged.</p>
			<p>Clearly, things then become more simple. Once we quit insisting on immutable laws and think in terms of design rules, used when they're really useful and ignored when they're in the way, we don't need a Theory of Everything and bizarre patch jobs like string theory or dark matter at all. Think of it as unintelligent design. And if you would like to think that we really are made in someone's image, then all of the bad software design work in the world becomes a whole lot easier to live with.</p> 
			<p>Feeling uncomfortable yet? Well, let's try this then. Imagine yourself sitting with others at a white board at <a href="http://lindenlab.com/">Linden Lab</a> when Second Life was first being spec'ed out. All kinds of decisions would need to be made, wouldn't they? Should gravity apply, or not? If it does apply (but not so inflexibly &mdash; those lucky avatars can fly!), then we need rules for things like acceleration, or all chaos would result as Second Life becomes more densely populated. And to implement these rules in software, we'd need to have formulae, to make them feasible and predictable, wouldn't we?</p>
			<p>Now let's say we wanted to be more conservative and anal than the Linden Lab folks were, or perhaps we just wanted to make our virtual world much more complex (as Linden Lab may itself do over time). We might then want those rules &mdash; standards, after all &mdash; to interoperate seamlessly in order to permit that complexity to operate successfully. If we wanted to allow space travel to other virtual worlds, we'd need (and depending on our personalities, want) to work that out, too.   And so on.</p>
			<p>Viewed from that perspective, what are physics and astrophysics and the math that serves them but a set of standards for how objects and energy are <em>instructed</em> to act? And so we see that when physical laws are viewed simply as design rules, then gravity needs no more explanation or reason for existing than does math &mdash; it could be just a feature the designers found to be useful.  Once described and encoded, the rule must be obeyed. "It" then just "is" because "it" is the implementation of a standard that governs the world (virtual or real).</p>
			<p>That of course leaves open the same old Big Question: Who "wrote" the standards? A Creator in the traditional, religious sense? Some cosmic virtual world vendor? A standards committee (composed of who, or perhaps what)?  I'll leave that question up to you, but I'd love to ask whoever it was a few other questions, like these: if it was all discretionary anyway, <em>why didn't you let me fly</em>?  And isn't it about time to release Earth 2.0, maybe without Dick Cheney this time?</p>
			<p>Regardless, the more detailed and finely tuned our virtual worlds become, the more uncomfortable this type of question may feel, as the similarities between our (supposedly) real world and these virtual worlds increasingly outweigh the differences. As this occurs, more questions may arise, like this one: perhaps the Kidnapped by Aliens crowd may not be so crazy after all &mdash; maybe the designers of earth just did a lousy job on the travel between virtual worlds standards Bob Sutor thinks we need. After all, a few bad standards would really add to the credibility of the theory, wouldn't it?</p>
			<p>So there you are. Something to think about the next time you have nothing to think about. And if you do, here's one last thing to mull over: will our world (game?) really end when the sun becomes a red giant and roasts us to a cinder, or will some cosmic server with a faulty backup program simply and inevitably crash someday?</p>
			<p>No burn, no bang. Just an all too imaginable whimper as the hard drives coast s-l-o-w-l-y to a halt…</p>
			<p>Damn! I <em>hate</em> it when that happens!</p>
