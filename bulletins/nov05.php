                  <p align="left" class="style2">This month's issue completes a four-part series of CSBs dedicated to examining the relationship between government at all levels and private sector standard setting.  The previous issues focused on lack of coordination between the public and private sectors (<a href='http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/aug05.php'> Government and SSO's: Optimizing the System</a>, in August), the role that governments can sometimes play in accelerating the uptake of standards (<a href='http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php'>Massachusetts and OpenDocument:  The Commonwealth Leads the Way</a>, in September), and on the increasingly complex standards challenges that governments and industry will need to cooperatively address in the future <a href='http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/oct05.php'> (Standards for a Small Planet</a>, in October).</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This month, the subject is  once again global standard setting, and the focus is on second plenary meeting  of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which was held in Tunis,  Tunisia earlier this month.&nbsp; The WSIS  process is dedicated to bridging the Digital Divide between the First and the  Third World, and has set a goal of bringing the Internet &quot;within  reach&quot; of half of the world's peoples by 2015.&nbsp; Despite this worthy goal, much of the time and effort of the 175  nations involved has been squandered thus far in a wrangle over the question  &quot;Who should govern the Internet?&quot;</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>,  I reflect on the fact that while the governance issue has been finessed for  now, the United States has (once again) stepped on many international toes in  order to maintain its hegemony over the root zone of the Internet, which it  currently controls via its oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned  Number and Names (ICANN).&nbsp; Perhaps some  day what goes around will come back around in a way that we find less than desirable.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This month's <strong><em>Feature  Article</em></strong> provides an in-depth review of the WSIS process, describing how  it came into being, what it sought to accomplish, how the ICANN impasse arose,  and how it was resolved (at least for now).&nbsp;  The article closes on a more hopeful note than the Editorial, hypothesizing  that with time the ICANN episode will be seen as an irrelevant diversion.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This month's <strong><em>Blog </em></strong>entry  was written on the closing day of the WSIS Summit in Tunis, and highlights some  of the party lines that each of the various camps involved sought to spin to  the press to put the best gloss on the governance compromise that was reached  on the eave of the Summit.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Of course, in another sense  what this issue of the <strong><em>CSB</em></strong> is really about is the challenge of  achieving consensus among those with widely divergent, and strongly held  beliefs.&nbsp; Accordingly, my <strong><em>Consider  This</em></strong> piece also explores some of the problems with getting to  &quot;yes&quot; when perspectives are very different.&nbsp; To make my points I return to a story that was featured through  the last two issues, and which is continuing to play out in Massachusetts: the  face-off between the supporters of the OASIS OpenDocument format, and  Microsoft, which has pledged to offer its XML Office Schemas to Ecma, a  European standards organization, as a standard.&nbsp; The piece contrasts two equally valid modes of analysis that can  be applied to Microsoft's XML &quot;covenant not to sue&quot; to reach very  different conclusions, as an example of why consensus is so hard to achieve.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Next month, you can look  forward to our annual wrap up of the year's most significant standards stories,  as well as our recognition of those journalists whose work was most  consistently informative during the year.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As always, I hope you enjoy  this issue.&nbsp; </p>

              <p align="center" class="style10"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></strong></font></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In December of 2003, the representatives of 175 nations met  in Geneva with the avowed purpose of bringing the blessings of the Internet to  all peoples, everywhere.&nbsp; The name given  to the endeavor was the World Summit for the Information Society (WSIS), and its  sponsor was the United Nations.&nbsp; Last  week, the agents of 174 nations and their retainers and camp followers  reassembled, some 19,000 strong, in Tunis, Tunisia to report on what progress  had been made against achieving the grand vision to which they had pledged  their efforts two years before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly,  that progress appears to amount to very little, although the benefits that  universal connectivity can bring grow richer by the day.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Nowhere was the record of non-achievement more visible than  with respect to making progress on a topic that was originally called  &quot;Internet governance,&quot; but which eventually narrowed to the single  question of &quot;Who should govern the Internet.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; More specifically, the argument concerned  who should control the Internet Corporation on Assigned Numbers and Names  (ICANN), which was created in 1988 by the United States Department of Commerce  to administer the country codes and site addresses upon which the Internet is,  in part, based.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Although ICANN's governance structure includes a degree of  international representation, it is ultimately under the control of the  Department of Commerce, which abruptly announced less than five months before  the Tunis Summit that it would not relinquish control of ICANN in 2006, as had  earlier been promised.&nbsp; The result was  an uproar that eventually culminated in even the European Union deserting the  American camp just a few weeks before the Summit.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In many ways, the ICANN conflict represented one of those  prismatic issues that appear to be discrete, but under closer scrutiny can be  broken into a spectrum of equally contentious matters, any one of which would  be challenging to resolve.&nbsp; All at the  same time, opinions relating to the &quot;go it alone&quot; attitude of the  United States, the inefficient bureaucracy of the United Nations, the power of  multi-national corporations, the demands of technology versus governance ideals  for civil society, and much more were brought into conflict, and all without an  established mechanism to break the impasse.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">So complex were the forces at work and so firm the opinions,  that three quarters of the way between the Geneva and the Tunis Summits a  meeting held to reach a consensus position on Internet Governance resulted in  not one, or even two proposals, but four.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The difficulty in arriving at a solution that was truly  acceptable to all on ICANN may not be surprising, because to some extent the  ICANN issue was more symbolic than material.&nbsp;  The actual role of ICANN is limited and in the main quite technical and  administrative.&nbsp; But the potential  damage and mischief that could be caused by its mismanagement or manipulation  is great.&nbsp; This led the U.S. government  to focus on the importance of maintaining stability, and much of the rest of  the world to focus on the inequity of a single nation asserting the right to  unilaterally control what has become an essential global resource.&nbsp; Ultimately, the issue became binary &ndash; in  order for one side to win, the other would have to lose, and there proved to be  no middle ground of acceptable compromise.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Given that the Internet is at the very heart of the WSIS  process, the rancor generated over the ICANN issue came to overshadow almost  everything else that was under discussion, and perhaps undermined the  effectiveness of the entire process.&nbsp;  Ultimately, the common wisdom that &quot;possession is nine tenths of  the law&quot; resulted in the formation of a weak, international &quot;Internet  Governance Forum&quot; that might, or might not, grow into a more significant  governing body in the future.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As with the failure of the U.S. Senate to approve American  participation in the League of Nations in 1919, this new assertion of  unilateralism so early in the WSIS process may weaken the ongoing influence of  the WSIS initiative, just as it certainly diverted energies from more fruitful  goals during the second phase of the WSIS process.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">For now, a Band-Aid has been placed on the issue of who  will&nbsp; &quot;govern the Internet,&quot;  but beneath the thin film of the Tunis &quot;compromise&quot; the wound  continues to fester.&nbsp; Over time, it can  be assumed that more rather than fewer information and communications  technology (ITC) issues will arise that have global significance, and it will  not be tolerable to 175 nations to be beholden to one for their control  forever.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The ultimate irony is that the Internet (and the Web) are  built not on national power, but on technical standards.&nbsp; ICANN is merely the entity that employs some  of those standards to provide addresses for countries and Websites.&nbsp; If the standards can be set by consensus,  why cannot a way be found to manage their use by the same means?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Ultimately, the United States would be better served by  working to conceive such a consensus-based organization than by seeking to lock  up the Internet in an American basement.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">After all, the next core element of the ITC infrastructure  may be developed in some other country's basement.&nbsp; And then the shoe will be on the other foot.</p>

              <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style2">Introduction: </span></em></strong><span class="style2"> For more than three years, there has been an ongoing global process that is intended to achieve great and meritorious goals, and bears an appropriately imposing title: the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).  Launched by the United Nations and administered by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), it's goal is to bring to the third world all of the first world educational benefits and economic opportunities that can be delivered via the Internet.  Or, as the U.N. speaks of it, to "bridge the Digital Divide" between the haves and the have-nots.</span>
                    <p><span class="style2">Following a lengthy planning  process, the first phase of WSIS concluded with a plenary meeting at the close  of 2003, and a grand (if vague) program was announced.&nbsp; Two years later, on November 16 &ndash; 18, 2005,  the closing plenary session of the second phase of WSIS convened, bringing more  than 19,000 people from 174 countries to Tunis, Tunisia to conclude the initial  process, and to decide how next to proceed.&nbsp;  
                      </span>
                    <p class="style2">The original goals of the  second phase, however, were almost completely overshadowed in the global press  by two related, but tangential issues.&nbsp;  The first was the (at best) ironic choice of Tunis as a host for the  meeting, given that Tunisia is one of 15 countries that block access to  Internet sites that the government finds objectionable, and because that same  government has a record of imprisoning bloggers and journalists whose articles  it finds to be unacceptable.</p>
                      <p class="style2">The second issue was the  question of &quot;who should govern the Internet,&quot; which in this context  came to mean whether the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,  more familiarly known as &quot;ICANN,&quot; should continue to be subject to  the ultimate control of the United States Department of Commerce.&nbsp; In point of fact, ICANN already has an  international advisory group and an Australian as its President and CEO, and  all agree that the ICANN's technical stewardship (at least) of the registries  that it administers has been very successful.&nbsp;  But the theoretical potential for the U.S. to actively exercise control  at some future point in time to the disadvantage of a sovereign country (e.g.,  &quot;switching off&quot; its access to the Internet by delisting its national  identifier) angered some countries, and the mere fact of one country controlling  a key element of an increasingly essential global resource was inconsistent and  objectionable to many others..&nbsp; </p>
                      <p class="style2">As the dust settles on the  Tunisian desert where a tent city arose to house those that would build a brave  new equalitarian world of universal internet access, the question hangs in the  air:&nbsp; what, if anything, has the WSIS  process accomplished to date?</p>
                      <p class="style2"><em>The Dream :</em>&nbsp; The progress of WSIS has been far from rapid from its start.  It was first proposed by the Government of Tunisia at a Plenipotentiary Conference of the ITU held in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1988.  In due course, the ITU proposed a two-phase approach to the U.N., which approved that process, as well as the lead role of the ITU in convening it, on December 21, 2001. <a href="#1">1</a> </p>
                      <p class="style2">A series of Preparatory Conferences (PrepCons) and Regional Meetings were held in 2002 and 2003, culminating in the gathering in December of 2003 of representatives from 175 nations in Geneva, Switzerland, in a Summit hosted by the Swiss government.  The official output of the first phase was a <a href='http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html'>Declaration of Principles</a> and a related <a href='http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/poa.html'>Plan of Action</a>. <a href="#2">2</a> The first document is subtitled, "Building the Information Society: a global challenge in the new Millennium," and incorporates 67 articles, arranged into three sections outlining a common vision, principles for achieving that vision, and a closing commitment to act.  The first article states, in the elaborate style of United Nations documents:</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p class="style2"><strong>We, the representatives of the peoples  of the world</strong>, <strong>assembled  in Geneva from 10-12 December 2003 for the first phase of the World Summit on  the Information Society,</strong> declare our common desire and commitment to build  a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, where  everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge,  enabling individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full potential  in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life,  premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p class="style2">The  other 17 articles comprising the vision section acknowledge various core  principles of the United Nations, such as the sovereignty of member states, but  also commit to assist the poor, the marginalized, and the neglected, as well as  various identified groups, from women in underdeveloped countries to nomadic  peoples.</p>
                      <span class="style2">The operative principles recognize pragmatic  needs (e.g., creation of infrastructure to enable universal connectivity and  offering appropriate content, and the need of local government participation),  identify the specific societal benefits that such an infrastructure could  facilitate (better governmental action and sustainable development), and  highlight the ethical and related dimensions of the enterprise (fostering free  speech and honoring local diversity). The articles conclude with the following  statement:                      </span>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p class="style2"><strong>We are firmly convinced</strong> that we are collectively entering a new era of enormous potential, that  of the Information Society and expanded human communication. In this emerging  society, information and knowledge can be produced, exchanged, shared and  communicated through all the networks of the world. All individuals can soon,  if we take the necessary actions, together build a new Information Society  based on shared knowledge and founded on global solidarity and a better mutual  understanding between peoples and nations. We trust that these measures will  open the way to the future development of a true knowledge society.</p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p class="style2">Even a cursory reading of the  full text conveys the enormity of the undertaking that would be necessary to  achieve these lofty goals.</p>
                      <p class="style2">The Plan of Action in turn  quantifies the challenge, calling in Article 6 upon those committed to the WSIS  process to provide everyone in the world with access to television and radio  programming by 2015, and to bring the benefits of information and  communications technology (ICT) &quot;within the reach&quot; of at least half  of the world's inhabitants by the same date, among other goals. <br>
  But while the  aspirations expressed are grand and clear, the path to implementation is  not.&nbsp; The balance of the Plan is more  general than specific, calling for national governments to set their own goals,  and using words such as &quot;encourage,&quot; &quot;explore,&quot; and  &quot;promote&quot; rather than setting firm goals.&nbsp; Where specifics are given they are modest, as in article 8.d:&nbsp; &quot;Each country is encouraged to  establish at least one functioning Public/Private Partnership (PPP) or  Multi-Sector Partnership (MSP), by 2005 as a showcase for future action,&quot;  and no proposal for dedicated new funding is included.</p>
                      <p class="style2">The Plan of Action closes with an article that looks  towards the Summit to be held at the end of the second phase of the WSIS  process, stating vaguely:</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p class="style2">[T]he second phase of the WSIS should  consider, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
                        <p class="style2">a. Elaboration  of final appropriate documents based on the outcome of the Geneva phase of the  WSIS with a view to consolidating the process of building a global Information  Society, and reducing the Digital Divide and transforming it into digital  opportunities.</p>
                        <p class="style2">b. Follow-up  and implementation of the Geneva Plan of Action at national, regional and  international levels, including the United Nations system, as part of an  integrated and coordinated approach, calling upon the participation of all  relevant stakeholders. This should take place, inter alia, through partnerships  among stakeholders.</p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p class="style2"><strong><em>The reality :</em></strong>&nbsp; Given such grand goals conjoined with such a general plan of action, it would perhaps not be fair to have expected dramatic progress to be made towards achieving WSIS goals in two short years.  But questions relating to Internet "governance" arose even before the Geneva Summit, and quickly assumed a level of visibility and contentiousness that came to overshadow all other activities. </p>
                      <p class="style2">In a sense, this was hardly  surprising, given that the fact that WSIS was all about the Internet after  all.&nbsp; As  recognized in article 48 of the Declaration of Principles, the Internet had:</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p class="style2">&hellip;evolved into a global  facility available to the public and its governance should constitute a core  issue of the Information Society agenda. The international management of the  Internet should be multilateral, transparent and democratic, with the full  involvement of governments, the private sector, civil society and international  organizations&hellip;. </p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p class="style2">Too, given that  WSIS had been convened under the auspices of the U.N. and one of its agencies  (the ITU), it could only be expected that U.N. principles would be applied to  all issues at hand.</p>
                      <p class="style2"> Still, the next  article in the Declaration acknowledged (in a nod to ICANN and the several  standards consortia that provide the technical protocols upon which the  Internet and the Web depend) that,  &quot;The management of the Internet encompasses  both technical and public policy issues and should involve all stakeholders and  relevant intergovernmental and international organizations.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
                      <p class="style2"> Having given  everyone a seat at the table, Article 49 then makes an important, if not  completely realistic, attempt to tell everyone where to sit.&nbsp; It does this by defining the roles that the  various stakeholders are entitled to play, and seeks to define the boundaries  of their authority:</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p class="style2">a. Policy  authority for Internet-related public policy issues is the sovereign right of  States. They have rights and responsibilities for international  Internet-related public policy issues;</p>
                        <p class="style2">b. The  private sector has had and should continue to have an important role in the  development of the Internet, both in the technical and economic fields;</p>
                        <p class="style2">c. Civil  society has also played an important role on Internet matters, especially at  community level, and should continue to play such a role;</p>
                        <p class="style2">d. Intergovernmental  organizations have had and should continue to have a facilitating role in the  coordination of Internet-related public policy issues;</p>
                        <p class="style2">e. International  organizations have also had and should continue to have an important role in  the development of Internet-related technical standards and relevant policies. </p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p class="style2">Article 50 calls upon the  Secretary-General of the United Nations to create a &quot;working group on  Internet governance&hellip;to investigate and make proposals for action, as  appropriate, on the governance of Internet by 2005.&quot; </p>
                      <p class="style2">Article 13 of the Plan of  Action provides the charter of the Working Group on Internet Governance (which  inevitably became known as WGIG), reading in part as follows:</p>

                      <p class="style2">Obviously,  a precondition to making any progress at all on items ii &ndash; iv would in large  part require first agreeing upon the definition of what &quot;Internet  governance&quot; should mean, and those familiar with international relations  might have guessed that achieving consensus on such a definition in less than  two years might prove to be an aggressive goal in itself.</p>
                      <p class="style2"> But  one thing that almost everyone seemed to agree on immediately was that whatever  else Internet governance may or may not involve, control of the &quot;root  zone&quot; of the Internet was part of the package.&nbsp; Not too surprisingly, the root zone has been under the control of  the United States since DARPA funded the development of the Internet decades  ago.&nbsp; Since 1988, it has been under the  immediate administration of ICANN. </p>
                      <p class="style2"><strong><em>ICANN and the root directory:</em></strong>&nbsp; From the technical perspective, the duties that ICANN supervises represent trivial chores, rather than valuable privileges.  ICANN itself is a non-profit corporation that is incorporated in California, and receives no compensation for its trouble.  Moreover, what it manages is neither grand, nor even large: in fact, it is but two databases, one of modest size, and the other of trivial proportions.</p>
                      <p class="style2">The  first database comprises the so-called top-level domain names (or TLDs), which  collectively form the &quot;root zone file&quot;.&nbsp; This is the file that holds the country-unique extensions seen in  Internet addresses (.uk, .uk, etc.), as well as the handful of generic  extensions such as .com, .gov and .edu.&nbsp;  The technical art of creating such extensions goes no farther than  avoiding duplicates, and the policy discussions relating to the creation of new  generic extensions, while they can be tedious, are hardly complex in concept or  execution.&nbsp; The second data repository  contains the addresses that are unique to individual computers.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p class="style2">The actual day-to-day administration of these  databases is not carried out by ICANN, however.&nbsp; Those duties are performed under ICANN&rsquo;s supervision by another  organization, called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. <a href="#3">3</a> As a result, the number and name directories are  sometimes referred to as the &quot;IANA Databases.&quot;&nbsp; ICANN&rsquo;s contract to supervise the IANA was  most recently renewed (for three years) by the Department of Commerce on January  28, 2003. </p>
                      <p class="style2">IANA  does not itself, in fact, directly administer the individual numerical  addresses assigned to individual computers.&nbsp;  Instead, it assigns batches of addresses to five &quot;Regional Internet  Registries,&quot; each of which is responsible for assigning names within its  individual territory to ISPs (in smaller batches), which in turn eventually  assign individual addresses to individual computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                      <p class="style2">                        The  dramatic contrast between the attenuated role of ICANN over these simple name  and number files and the level of controversy over its powers has been aptly  summarized by one commentator as follows:</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p class="style2">Conventional wisdom has it  that these files could easily be managed by one person. IANA was, in fact, for  many years, managed by one person. The key question, as wiser folk than us have  pointed out before, is: &ldquo;Who tells that guy what to do?&quot; <a href="#4">4</a> </p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p class="style2">The answer to that question  today is ICANN &ndash; unless the Department of Commerce decides to veto an ICANN  decision and tell IANA what to do instead.&nbsp;  And therein lies the rub.</p>
              <p class="style2"><em>The (perceived) sins of ICANN:</em>&nbsp; If the root zone was all that was at stake, however, the situation might be less contentious.  Instead, there is concern that ICANN might venture out in other directions, and that even within its narrow purview, that it (or the Department of Commerce) could discriminate among countries and regions.  Technical issues can also have political overtones, particularly as respects setting priorities for the resolution of issues.  For example, current names don't yet resolve well in Korean,  and there has been controversy over whether ICANN has been too casual in forming consensus (e.g., concluding that if Japan is in favor of a decision, then all Asia has been satisfied).</p>
              <p class="style2">There is other baggage as well, some of which  ICANN is responsible for, and some of which it inherited.&nbsp; For example, in the days before address  needs began to proliferate wildly (and before ICANN became responsible for the  IANA Databases), IBM was assigned 33 <em>million</em> addresses, Stanford was  awarded 17 million, and the entire Peoples Republic of China was magnanimously  awarded just 9 million.&nbsp; The situation  was later rectified on ICANN's watch, but the original decision continues to  rankle.</p>
              <span class="style2">And although it has always  been conceded that the various U.S. stewards of the IANA Databases have capably  managed the technical process with little interference by the U.S. Government, <a href="#5">5</a> the governing structures of  ICANN have been roundly criticized for some time.&nbsp; This resulted in the decision on November 15, 2001 to form what  was initially called the Committee on Restructuring, and later as the Committee  on ICANN Evolution and Reform <a href="#6">6</a> The work of the Committee  was strongly influenced during its deliberations by a report presented by  ICANN&rsquo;s then President, Stuart Lynn, called &quot;ICANN &ndash; The Case for Reform.&quot; <a href="#7">7</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">This Committee in due  course delivered two documents, titled &ldquo;Recommendations for the Evolution and  Reform of ICANN,&rdquo; and&nbsp; &ldquo;ICANN: A  Blueprint for Reform&quot;. <a href="#8">8 </a>The Committee&rsquo;s reports are notable in a number  of ways, one of which is that the issues that it struggled with in 2002 remain  topics of contention today.&nbsp; As noted in  the Blueprint:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">The essence of the debate over  ICANN's Mission lies in the nexus between ICANN's technical coordination role,  its operational role, and its policy role. There are some who see ICANN as  merely an agent to carry out technical, operational instructions. The ERC does  not support this view because it leaves unanswered the question of  responsibility for the policy-development work necessary to provide answers to  precisely what instructions should be followed, that is, answering the  question: &quot;if not ICANN, then who?&quot;. We have not found any credible  answers to that question offered by those who favor a purely technical  operational ICANN, other than transferring such responsibilities to some  international treaty organization, a direction that is viewed with disfavor  throughout most of the community (as judged by the comments we received), or to  a constellation of organizations that would again beg the question of who will  coordinate these organizations&hellip;.</p>
                <p class="style2">In  the view of the ERC, there is not any more a legitimate debate over whether  ICANN has a role in policy development and implementation. It does. We also  believe that role should be limited to those policy areas that are reasonably  related to ICANN's technical mission. <a href="#9">9</a> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">ICANN has also been the subject of close  external examination.&nbsp; For example, the  Markle Foundation commissioned a report titled &ldquo;Enhancing Legitimacy in the  Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&rdquo; to coincide with the work  of the ICANN reform committee.&nbsp; The  report is critical of the ICANN Blueprint, and offers a variety of &ldquo;guidelines,  codes, approaches and practices which may be effective and appropriate for the  governance structure of ICANN.&quot; <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov05.php#news">10</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">Another example of the charges levied against  ICANN can be found in an analysis prepared under the imprint of the Georgia  Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Internet &amp; Public Policy Project in preparation  for the Tunis summit. <a href="#11">11</a> The analysis acknowledges that ICANN has incorporated a  number of policies that are intended to ensure regular review of its structure,  in order to keep step with technical and societal evolution.&nbsp; But it also concludes that ICANN must be  viewed, and governed, as a regulatory body.&nbsp;  It cites many areas of deficiency from this perspective, with the  following lapses in &ldquo;Internal Processes&rdquo; being representative:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">&hellip;ICANN&rsquo;s  bylaws have been fluid and unpredictable. They have been frequently amended  (approximately 20 times,) with the substance of the changes reflecting the  distribution of power among various stakeholders. Presumably, the changes were  made in consultation with political authorities, but such high-level political  processes were closed to public scrutiny. </p>
                <p class="style2">The  rule of law does not prevail in ICANN&rsquo;s internal processes. In 2002 industry  representatives to ICANN&rsquo;s board eliminated user representation on the board  altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp; An expert on democratic  process from the US-based Carter Center characterized this action as a &ldquo;coup,&rdquo;  i.e. a lawless seizure of power. <a href="#11">12</a> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">The  same author found evidence that ICANN had experienced multiple episodes of  &ldquo;regulatory capture&rdquo; by interest groups, usually to the benefit of Corporate  America.&nbsp; He cites the following &ldquo;main  episodes:&rdquo;</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">&bull; <strong>Capture  of International Forum on the White Paper (IFWP) (1998)</strong>: The process by  which the Internet community was to design ICANN was captured by powerful  industry and technical stakeholders. They boycotted public meetings and  successfully proposed their own secretly-written bylaws for ICANN. <br>
                  &bull; <strong>Capture  of ICANN Board (2002)</strong>: The same industry and technical interests eliminated  user representation on the board. (This remains the case today.) <br>
                  &bull; <strong>Capture  of the Internet Society (2002): </strong>In 2002 ISOC revised its bylaws to ensure  that the society would be governed by its largest corporate members. This has  led to two derivative acts of capture: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="style2"><strong>Capture of .ORG registry. </strong>This registry is now managed by ISOC. </li>
                  <li class="style2"><strong>Capture of ICANN&rsquo;s At Large Advisory Committee (ALAC). </strong>Nearly 60% of&nbsp; certified user-related organizations in  ICANN are chapters of ISOC. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="style2">&bull; <strong>Capture  of .COM by Network Solutions. </strong>This US corporation has extended its very  profitable control of the most popular domain name. <a href="#13">13</a> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">It is worth noting in passing that  the above is the analysis of an American author.&nbsp; Critics abroad have often been less complimentary.</p>
              <p class="style2"> A detailed review of the various proposals that have been  made over the years for the reform of ICANN and/or the transfer of its power to  a multinational entity is beyond the scope of this article, and in any event is  irrelevant to the point being made.&nbsp; The  fact is that three and a half years after the issuance of the Recommendations  and the Blueprint, ICANN has not succeeded in making sufficient changes to  satisfy many in the world community, despite the incorporation of a number of  significant changes.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Political Forces </em>:&nbsp;</strong> It may therefore hardly be surprising that most of the rest of the world found it clearly inequitable that a single country should control, in any way, a resource as essential as the Internet, however effective the management of the IANA Directories might have been to date from the technical point of view.  ICANN's control of the root zone, in particular, became increasingly problematic in the eyes of some as the standoff between the U.S. and the U.N. over Iraq deepened.  </p>
              <p class="style2">At the  same time, it had not escaped the notice of conservatives in the U.S. that some  of the strongest advocates for transferring control of the IANA Directories to  international control included traditional U.S. <em>b&ecirc;te noires</em> like Cuba,  Iran and China, nor that WSIS was operating under the auspices of the United  Nations &ndash; a body already reviled by many conservatives for (among other things)  the level of bureaucracy that had grown up within it over the decades.&nbsp; Why, in their view, would the U.S. ever wish  to relinquish something so important to the control of an organization that  they already regarded to be terminally inefficient and ineffective?</p>
              <p class="style2">While  the Iraq war may have inflamed feelings on the part of the rest of the world,  the &quot;oil for food&quot; scandal unfolding within the U.N. provided ample  fodder to support the arguments of those in the U.S. that the control of the  Internet was better left where it was.&nbsp;  Further fuel for American fires came from the fact that some of the  strongest advocates for international control also included nations with poor  human rights and free speech records, such as Tunisia.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> Nor  were all political suspicions drawn along national boundaries.&nbsp; The fact that the ITU (itself an agency of  the U.N.) had both proposed, and assumed the primary role in WSIS raised  suspicions that it regarded itself as the proper steward of the Internet.&nbsp; After all, it already was the primary global  arbiter of telecommunications regulation, with participation at the national  level, in most cases by governmental entities.&nbsp;  The IANA Directories had in fact ended up with ICANN more by default  than design, and many thought that the ITU was still regretting its lack of  interest in bidding on the business when the business was arguably up for  grabs.</p>
              <span class="style2">The  question of who would administer the IANA Directories was also timely, given  that a Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Commerce and ICANN  looked towards a transfer of control of ICANN from the DoC to the international  community by September of 2006.&nbsp; In  Mid-June of 2005, ICANN CEO Paul Twomey had stated publicly that ICANN was on  track and meeting all milestones to permit that transition to occur on schedule. <a href="#14"></a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">It  therefore came as a shock when at the end of June, 2005, Michael Gallagher, the  Assistant Secretary of the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (the division of the Department of Commerce that directly  supervises ICANN), announced during a speech on telecommunications topics that  the U.S. was withdrawing its commitment to cede control of ICANN, citing  business and national security concerns.&nbsp;  In making the announcement, Gallagher stated in part: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">Given the Internet's importance to the world's  economy, it is essential that the underlying DNS of the Internet remain stable  and secure. As such, the United States is committed to taking no action that  would have the potential to adversely impact the effective and efficient  operation of the DNS, and will therefore maintain its historic role in  authorizing changes or modifications to the authoritative root zone file. <a href="#15">14</a> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">It did not help that the chief U.S. negotiator  at WSIS appeared to be cut from the same confrontational cloth as John Bolton,  the controversial American Ambassador to the U.N. whose approval had been  blocked in Congress not long before. <a href="#16">15 </a>That individual was David  Gross, the U.S. coordinator for international communications and information  policy at the State Department, who was wont to make statements such as this: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">We will not agree to the U.N. taking over the  management of the Internet.&nbsp; Some  countries want that. We think that&rsquo;s unacceptable. We&rsquo;ve been very, very clear  throughout the process that there are certain things we can agree to and  certain things we can&rsquo;t agree to. It&rsquo;s not a negotiating issue. This is a  matter of national policy. <a href="#17">16</a></p>
                </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">The stage was therefore well-set for escalating  emotions in the run up to the Tunis summit. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Technical concerns:</em></strong>&nbsp; At the same time, there was genuine concern on the part of the technical community that political forces would intrude into their domain, causing who knew what mischief to be wrought within the unprecedented global network that had grown up around a handful of protocols and standards.  Would domain names need to be localized to assuage concerns over national languages?  Could the Internet still operate at all if such changes were demanded?  Would it become Balkanized as demands for political correctness trumped technical imperatives?  And did anyone truly want the technical operations of the Internet to be subject to the famously glacial progress of treaty organizations?</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>The Result :</em>&nbsp;</strong> Following the unexpected desertion by the EU from the American camp at PrepCon 3 it might have seemed as if the United States was in an impossibly isolated position, but for one fact:  it still had actual control of the IANA Directories, and there was no effective way for other countries to alter that fact without doing more harm than good.  </p>
              <p class="style2">Until the eve of the Tunis conference, neither  side was publicly blinking, despite the fact that a conversation on the topic  was held not long before between President Bush and European Commission  President Jose Manuel Barroso.&nbsp; For his  part, Ambassador Gross stated the American position upon his arrival in Tunis  as follows: &rdquo;We would be sorely disappointed not to have a document at all, but  that would be better than to have a bad document.&quot; <a href="#18">17</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">The  result was an urgent need for some sort of compromise, and ideally one that was  as face-saving as possible for both sides.&nbsp;  That compromise was reached in a private meeting on Sunday, November 13,  2005, and announced prior to the convening of the formal part of the Summit on  November 16.</p>
              <span class="style2">The  substance of the agreement reached was one that both sides claimed validated  its position.&nbsp; But it was clear that the  United States had given up little, and that its opponents had settled for the  formation of a new forum which would explicitly have no powers over Internet governance. <a href="#19">18</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">For all the <em>sturm und drang</em> of the  preceding four years, the formal documents approved at the Tunis Summit were  very muted on the topic of Internet governance.&nbsp; The Tunis Commitment <a href="#20">19</a> that  was approved had only this to say on the subject, in article 7:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><strong>We reaffirm the  commitments made in Geneva</strong> and build on them in  Tunis by focusing on financial mechanisms for bridging the digital divide, on  Internet governance and related issues, as well as on follow-up and  implementation of the Geneva and Tunis decisions, as referenced in the Tunis  Agenda for the Information Society. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">The second document <a href="#21">20</a> deals  with the topic in much greater detail, in articles 29 through 82.&nbsp; But many of these articles merely  &ldquo;reaffirm,&rdquo; &ldquo;acknowledge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; bland goals and verities, and/or  restate articles without change from the Plan of Action adopted at Geneva two  years before.&nbsp; The balance of the  articles, however, cover a wide range of topics, such as the need for regional  directories, initiatives to foster connectivity and ecommerce, and abuses  demanding joint action, such as Spam, cybercrime, and terrorism.</p>
              <p class="style2">The  Agenda does include a set of statements touching on the IANA Directories and  ICANN, albeit tangentially.&nbsp; Beginning  with article 57, a series of principals are laid down, including the following:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">57. The  security and stability of the Internet must be maintained. <br>
                  58. We  recognize that Internet Governance includes more than Internet naming and  addressing. It also includes other significant public policy issues such as, <em>inter  alia</em>, critical Internet resources, the security and safety of the Internet,  and developmental aspects and issues pertaining to the use of the Internet.<br>
                  59<em>. </em>We  recognize that Internet Governance includes social, economic and technical  issues including affordability, reliability and quality of service. <br>
                  60.  We further recognize that there are many cross-cutting international public  policy issues that require attention and are not adequately addressed by the  current mechanisms.                </p>
                </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">The Agenda then responds to the calls for a  multilateral venue for Internet policy debate:</p>
              <p class="style2">72. We  ask the UN Secretary-General, in an open and inclusive process, to convene, by  the second quarter of 2006, a meeting of the new forum for multi-stakeholder  policy dialogue&mdash;called the <em>Internet Governance Forum</em> (IGF).The mandate  of the Forum is to:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">a. Discuss public policy  issues related to key elements of Internet Governance in order to foster the  sustainability, robustness, security, stability and development of the  Internet; </p>
                <p class="style2">b. Facilitate discourse  between bodies dealing with different cross-cutting international public  policies regarding the Internet and discuss issues that do not fall within the  scope of any existing body; </p>
                <p class="style2">c. Interface with  appropriate inter-governmental organizations and other institutions on matters  under their purview; </p>
                <p class="style2">d. Facilitate the exchange  of information and best practices, and in this regard make full use of the  expertise of the academic, scientific and technical communities; </p>
                <p class="style2">e. Advise all stakeholders  in proposing ways and means to accelerate the availability and affordability of  the Internet in the developing world; </p>
                <p class="style2">f. Strengthen and enhance  the engagement of stakeholders in existing and/or future Internet Governance  mechanisms, particularly those from developing countries; </p>
                <p class="style2">g. Identify emerging  issues, bring them to the attention of the relevant bodies and the general  public, and, where appropriate, make recommendations; </p>
                <p class="style2">h. Contribute to  capacity-building for Internet Governance in developing countries, drawing fully  on local sources of knowledge and expertise; </p>
                <p class="style2">i. Promote and assess, on  an ongoing basis, the embodiment of WSIS principles in Internet Governance  processes; </p>
                <p class="style2">j. Discuss, <em>inter alia</em>,  issues relating to critical Internet resources; </p>
                <p class="style2">k. Help to find solutions  to the issues arising from the use and misuse of the Internet, of particular  concern to everyday users; </p>
                <p class="style2">l. Publish its  proceedings. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">Equally significant is what would be  specifically excluded from the IGF&rsquo;s mandate:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">77. The IGF would have no oversight function and  would not replace existing arrangements, mechanisms, institutions or  organizations, but would involve them and take advantage of their expertise. It  would be constituted as a neutral, non-duplicative and non-binding process. It  would have no involvement in day-to-day or technical operations of the  Internet. </p>
                <p class="style2">79.  Diverse matters relating to Internet Governance would continue to be addressed  in other relevant fora.                 </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">In  short, a forum would be created where anyone could meet and discuss matters of  policy, but the IGF would not have the power to tell anyone what to do.</p>
              <p class="style2"> And  what of the central issue that had created so much controversy, and that had  been styled as the question of &quot;Who should govern the Internet?&quot;&nbsp; The sole statement that bears directly on  that question is found in a single article of the Agenda document, and reads in  its entirety as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">63.Countries  should not be involved in decisions regarding another country&rsquo;s country-code  Top-Level Domain (ccTLD). Their legitimate interests, as expressed and defined  by each country, in diverse ways, regarding decisions affecting their ccTLDs,  need to be respected, upheld and addressed via a flexible and improved  framework and mechanisms. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">Pretty  thin gruel after so much contention and posturing, especially since the United  States had never disputed this principle to begin with, and no specific actions  are mandated by the article.</p>
              <p class="style2"> While  the EU tried to claim credit for brokering a compromise, and the U.S. tried to  suggest that valuable progress had been made (while at the same time ensuring  that no one could think that it had yielded an inch), there was little doubt  that the peoples of the world, assembled in Tunis, had effectively been told to  bugger off by the world&rsquo;s sole remaining superpower, and had found that they  had little choice but to acquiesce.</p>
              <span class="style2">For  his part, UN Secretary Koffi Annan put the best face possible on the situation:  &quot;Let me be absolutely clear: the United Nations does not want to take  over, police or otherwise control the Internet.&nbsp; Day-to-day running of the Internet must be left to technical  institutions, not least to shield it from the heat of day to
              day politics.&quot; <a href="#22">21</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Conclusions:</em>&nbsp;</strong> Was this a "good" outcome?  Putting all political tactics and repercussions to one side, one could perhaps make a persuasive case that it was.  In point of fact, the significance of the IANA Directories was always more symbolic than real, and more technically important than meaningful as a vehicle for advancing social policy.  At the same time, for lack of another appropriate forum and due to the ongoing debate over its role, ICANN had the potential to venture into other policy areas where its structure, authority and mandate might be problematic in practice, and certainly controversial under its current structure.</p>
              <p class="style2">By  creating a new forum within which the many issues of true social significance  could be addressed, ICANN&rsquo;s potential for adventuring would be reduced, and its  role more conclusively established as being limited to the name and number  directories &ndash; and no more.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Too, ICANN already has a  parlous history and a much-criticized structure.&nbsp; The IGF will have a clean slate upon which to write, will be free  to create whatever governance structure it wishes (within appropriate bounds),  and may lead to a successor organization with real authority to cover real and  serious issues that can only be addressed multilaterally, such as  cybercrime.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Ten years from now, perhaps,  the entire controversy over &ldquo;who should control the IANA Directories may seem  to have been just a strange obsession that led to a great deal of wasted time  during the four years of the WSIS process.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Or, at least, so we can  hope.</p>

              <p align="center"> <strong> <span class="style10"><strong>Spin Sets in on Internet Governance Compromise</strong> </span></strong></p>
              <p align="center"><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">So the logjam on Internet governance has broken. The  question is, who blinked - the U.S. or everyone else? </p>
              <p class="style2">The issue of &quot;who should rule the Internet&quot;  attracted increasing coverage after the EU reversed polarity and abandoned  support for the U.S. position on this issue. That occurred not long ago, at the  last formal meeting (called PrepCon3) preceding the vast summit meeting that  came to order on Wednesday, bringing more than 19,000 participants together in  Tunis, Tunisia, to plan a global &quot;information society&quot;. </p>
              <p class="style2">The question at hand has been whether ICANN, the Internet  Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names, would retain its control of the  root directory of the Internet, and whether it would remain subservient to the  U.S. government, via the supervision of the American Department of Commerce.  Once the EU dropped its support of ongoing U.S. hegemony, it left the battle  lines starkly drawn, and for all intents and purposes, the U.S. was on one side  of the line, and on the other side was everyone else. </p>
              <p class="style2">The last-minute desertion by the EU left the US with only  two options: agree to a compromise of its control in advance of the Summit, or  engage in a very public confrontation with multiple opponents in front of those  19,000 attendees, not to mention under the scrutiny of an intently watching  world, served by legions of media looking for juicy stories where there would  be few to be found.&nbsp; But the U.S. did  have one advantage, and that was a big one: current control of the root zone of  the Internet.&nbsp; If it wished to dig in,  there was very little that anyone could do about it.</p>
              <p class="style2">There were some reports heading into the final weekend  before the Tunis Summit attempts were in process to break the impasse. And,  sure enough, on the first day of the Summit it was announced that a concordat  had indeed been signed the night before that would take the Internet governance  issue off the table before the Summit began its debate. But if one side  blinked, which one was it? </p>
              <p class="style2">One of the first articles released spun the compromise as a  defeat for the U.S., headlining the story <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=5313">WSIS: US caves over internet monopoly </a>.  That article opened as follows: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"> The  US has agreed to consult with other governments over top-level domain names in  a major shift in the US policy on control of the internet, EU officials  confirmed on Wednesday....Under the deal, struck late on Tuesday night, all  parties agreed that &quot;no government should have the last word on another  country's top level domain&quot;, said Martin Selmayr, a spokesman for EU  Information Society Commissioner Viviane Reding, who attended the meeting. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2"> But contrary to that headline, the &quot;caving&quot; by the  US and the victory of the rest of the World appears to be more token than  defeat: the same article indicates that the primary compromise made by the U.S.  was simply that the American Department of Commerce would consult with a  country before taking any action affecting its domain identifier. Hardly  revolutionary stuff, that. </p>
              <p class="style2">But if the U.S. didn't cave, does that mean that the  opposition did? 
                That's the way it looked to the Business Standard, in India,  in an article posted yesterday called <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/common/storypage.php?storyflag=y&leftnm=lmnu5&leftindx=5&lselect=1&chklogin=N&autono=205973">Internet Control</a>. As the Business  Standard saw it: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"> The  rhetoric centred on control of the Internet turned out to be just hot air,  after a compromise was hammered out at the World Information Summit in Tunis.  The US remains in unilateral control. Status quo has been maintained with  respect to technical functionality as well as regulatory power. While a  multinational body, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) consisting of national  governments, corporations and NGOs, has been created, this has &ldquo;no oversight  function and would not replace existing arrangements, mechanisms, institutions  or organisations, but involve them and take advantage of their expertise&rdquo;. The  forum &ldquo;would have no involvement in day-to-day or technical operations&rdquo;.  Translated, the IGF will act like a scaled-up version of the typical Internet  forum. It will allow frustrated users to rant and rave, or to offer useful  suggestions. But these suggestions will not be binding. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                So it is that as details of the horse trading and next steps  on Internet governance are finding their way into the media, each article  manifests its own spin on what happened behind closed doors, and what will  happen next. <br>
                Here in its entirety, for example, is the official (and  self-congratulatory) EU <a href="http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/05/1433&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">press release</a> on the compromise,  which claims credit for putting back together what it had helped to put asunder  only a few weeks before at PrepCon3: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="center" class="style78">                EU brokers deal on progressive internationalisation of  Internet<br>                  
                  governance at Tunis World Summit </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                  EU  brokers deal on progressive internationalisation of Internet governance at  Tunis World Summit </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> A  worldwide political agreement providing for further internationalisation of  Internet governance, and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end,  was brokered at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis last  night. The compromise text agreed was based largely on EU proposals presented  in the discussions since June. As a first important element of the agreement, a  new international Internet Governance Forum (IGF) will be created to deliberate  among governments, the private sector and civil society at large in a  multi-stakeholder policy dialogue related to Internet Governance. A first  meeting of this Forum will be convened by the Secretary-General of the United  Nations by the second quarter of 2006 and take place in Greece. The texts  agreed in Tunis also include language that will allow for enhanced cooperation  among governments, on an equal footing, on public policy issues. Such  cooperation should include the development of globally applicable principles on  public policy issues associated with the coordination and management of  critical Internet resources. This cooperation will make use of relevant  international organisations. There was also a consensus in Tunis yesterday that  countries should not be involved in decisions regarding another country&rsquo;s Top  Level Domain, thus meeting requests made, in particular, by the EU in the  negotiations. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">&ldquo;I  welcome the texts now agreed in Tunis. They pave the way for a progressive  internationalisation of Internet governance&rdquo;, commented Viviane Reding, EU  Commissioner for Information Society and Media, who is leading the Commission  delegation in Tunis. &ldquo;This agreement was possible because of the strong belief  of all democratic nations that enhanced international cooperation is the best  way to make progress towards guaranteeing the freedom of the Internet around  the globe and also to enhance transparency and accountability in decisions  affecting the architecture of the Web. The fact that the EU spoke with one  voice in Tunis, and had stood by its case for more cooperation on Internet  governance in the run-up to the summit, certainly strongly influenced this  positive agreement&rdquo;. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> The  text finalised last night reflects a consensus of all participants of the Tunis  summit. It will now be officially adopted by the Heads of State or Government,  or their representatives, in the course of the World Summit on Information  Society that officially starts today and will last until Friday. For the  Commission, the days to come will focus on gaining the support of other nations  for the EU&rsquo;s policy of investing in Information and Communication Technology,  as a means to overcome the &ldquo;digital divide&rdquo;. In addition, the Commission will  reiterate its position on the need to safeguard human rights, and in particular  freedom of speech, in order to build a truly global Information Society. </p>

              <p><span class="style56">#34</span><strong class="style38"><em> The way ain't far, but you can't get there from here  </em></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">The  title above is the punchline for an ancient bit of rural humor.&nbsp; It's the answer the local gives, after due  deliberation, to the city guy in the car who's asking for directions.&nbsp; But it often seems like an apt description  of the likelihood of reaching agreement between two firmly entrenched points of  view.</p>
              <p class="style2">How  can it be so often the case that two intelligent people can have firm &ndash; and  diametrically opposed &ndash; opinions on the same issue?&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">This  situation is so common that we simply take it for granted, especially as  election times approach.&nbsp; But perhaps if  we spent more time answering this question, we might find it easier to achieve  consensus.</p>
              <p class="style2">Of  course, there are many reasons why people disagree, ranging from simple  misreading of relevant facts to outright bigotry.&nbsp; In fact, the process of forming an opinion involves a series of  independent steps and processes, and any one of them can lead to divergent  results.</p>
              <p class="style2">For example, there is the  gathering and confirmation of facts, followed by deciding which are relevant  and which are not, after which one places them in a pattern that is meaningful,  to which cone then applies intelligence, past experience and creativity to  arrive, finally, at an opinion.&nbsp; And  that is an over simplification (or, for a thinking person, at least should be).</p>
              <p class="style2">The following is an example  of how two radically different results on the importance of a single sentence  can be reached, simply by choosing which frame of reference to use in reaching  a judgment.&nbsp; The sentence is as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">Microsoft  irrevocably covenants that it will not seek to enforce any of its patent claims  necessary to conform to the technical specifications for the Microsoft Office  2003 XML Reference Schemas posted at  http://msdn.microsoft.com/office/understanding/xmloffice/default.aspx (the  &ldquo;Specifications&rdquo;) against those conforming parts of software products. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">Does this sentence  constitute a radical departure from historical Microsoft intellectual property  rights policy, or a smokescreen meant to imply much, but promise little?&nbsp; The answer is that it depends upon the frame  of reference, and the situation, in which you ask the question.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Consider the following:&nbsp; On November 22 and 25 I posted two blog  entries on this same topic.&nbsp; The first  was written and posted the day that Microsoft announced&nbsp; &quot;covenant not to sue&quot; from which the  sentence above is excerpted.&nbsp; That  covenant relates to the current version of its XML Reference Schema, and the  covenant was issued as part of an effort by Microsoft to head off a challenge  to its flagship (and extremely profitable) Office software suite by competing  products based upon the OpenDocument Format (ODF), an OASIS standard that benefits  from a covenant not to sue on the part of Sun Microsystems.</p>
              <p class="style2">This first post was based primarily on a comparison of the Microsoft covenant, in the context of a yet-to-be-granted adoption of the XML Reference Schema by Ecma, a European standards body, with the Sun covenant, in the context of the already issued OASIS standard.  You can read the lengthy line-by-line analysis, which was titled "Microsoft's Format Covenant Fails Comparison Test with Sun's" <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1762">here</a>, but for current purposes we'll simply skip forward to my final conclusion, and the questions to which that conclusion led me:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">The upshot is that the Sun  covenant is far superior in several important respects to the Microsoft pledge. </p>
                <p class="style2">This raises the question:  Why? Certainly, Microsoft must have expected that a comparative analysis like  this would be done almost immediately, so it must have had a strong incentive  to match the Sun covenant as closely as possible, and it decided not to. Again:  Why? </p>
                <p class="style2">There are three  possibilities. The first is that it has evil entrapment plans afoot, but I  really don't think that is likely to be the case, and certainly not in each  instance, since it would be rightly pilloried for doing so. The second is that  it hasn't gotten far enough through the knothole to bring itself to go as far  as Sun did. </p>
                <p class="style2">The third is that it has  made the calculated decision that this is as far as it needs to go to obtain  the objective that it is trying to achieve, which is to head off ODF at the  pass. </p>
                <p class="style2">Which is it? My guess is  that it's a combination of 2 and 3. I'm told by those I know in Microsoft that  making such a covenant was a difficult and contentious decision internally, and  it would be tough to sell internally more than the absolute minimum necessary  to arguably do the job. </p>
                <p class="style2">Will it be enough? We'll  find out. But on my review, there's a lot of light standing between the two  covenants which will provide plenty for people to talk about. Microsoft knows  its customers well, though, and it&rsquo;s the customers ultimately that will say  whether Microsoft bet its hand conservatively and still won, or didn't act  boldly enough to walk away with the pot. </p>
                <p class="style2">Given that Microsoft has  already collected some endorsements from European governments in favor of its  formats, backed by the Ecma announcement (its not coincidence that Ecma is a  European standards developer), its clear that its already test marketed its bid  with its customers. </p>
                <p class="style2">The bid now passes across  the table. Who's going to make the next bet? </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">Lots of people found  that pretty convincing, and the right mode of analysis.&nbsp; But was it?&nbsp;  Three days later, I took a crack at it from another perspective in a  post titled &quot;The Microsoft Covenant Reexamined,&quot; which you can read  in full (if you are so inclined) <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1769">here</a>. I  explained the basis for this second analysis as follows: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">Some of my friends at  Microsoft thought that [my first analysis] was an unfair way to present the  covenant. By comparing the Microsoft covenant to Sun's, I was necessarily  ending up with a &quot;glass half full&quot; result. Instead, they thought I  should have provided an analysis of the covenant solely on its own merits. </p>
                <p class="style2">This strikes me as a  fair request, so in order to present a more balanced picture, in this post I'll  look at the Microsoft covenant from the following perspective: how much better  is the new covenant than the old 2003 XML Reference Schema license? At the end  of this entry, I'll then try and reconcile the two analyses and see where we  come out.                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">This time, my  analysis came out rather differently, because now I was asking a different  question as the first step in reaching a final conclusion.&nbsp; The analysis therefore concluded as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">So  is the new covenant a significant improvement? There is no question that it is,  and Microsoft therefore deserves credit for moving its IPR position so  substantially. Hopefully it will take the same posture with other patents in  its portfolio in the future, where significant standards opportunities arise. </p>
                </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">Of course, that still left the task of reconciling the two  analyses in order to attempt to come to a final, valid conclusion, but that&rsquo;s  not really the point of this essay (if you&rsquo;re curious, though, you can read the  last part of the second blog entry). </p>
              <p class="style2"> There  are two morals to be drawn from this simple exercise.&nbsp; The first one is that it's very easy to adopt a single analytical  approach (especially if it is sympathetic with your personal viewpoint), and  then stick with it.&nbsp; But once you become  locked into a given perspective, it may become difficult or impossible to agree  with someone else on an answer, unless they have adopted the same  perspective.&nbsp; It may also make it  extremely unlikely that you will come up with the &quot;right&quot; answer  yourself.</p>
              <p class="style2">                The  second moral is that while perspectives are wonderful tools for examining a  problem in order to appreciate certain dimensions of an issue, by definition  they sacrifice a degree of objectivity in exchange for heightened perceptivity,  much as intense light may highlight certain subtle features that might  otherwise escape notice, but will also wash out colors, yielding a distorted picture.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Ultimately,  it doesn't matter which end of the telescope you look through.&nbsp; Either way, things will appear larger or  smaller than they really are when you use your unaided vision.&nbsp; The trick is in reconciling the images to  get at the truth.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Sadly,  all too often we take the easy way out in an argument, and simply conclude that  you can't get to an answer from here.</p>

It should be a society &quot;in which  human capacity is expanded, built up, nourished and liberated, giving people  access to the tools and technologies they need, with the education and training  to use them effectively.&quot; The hurdle here, he said, is more political than  financial. &quot;The costs of connectivity, computers and mobile telephones can  be brought down.

All that fly-blown cant about Declarations of Principles and Plans of  Action. All those delegates from countries of which one has never previously  heard, unable to believe their luck at getting abroad on expenses and  determined to make a speech to justify them. All those corporate sleazeballs,  circling the delegations like flies round dung-heaps, hoping for Heads of  Agreement and laying the groundwork for contracts, not to mention the  associated kickbacks generally required to do business in parts of the world  where dysentery is an occupational hazard. <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1646575,00.html">...Full  Story</a>                                      </p>

No court cases have been  filed, but the issue is serious enough that several companies have pledged not  to use their patent portfolios against the open source operating system. Some  activists have claimed that the whole concept of patent pledges is misguided.  ZDNet Australia sister site ZDNet UK spoke with OSDL Chief Executive Stuart  Cohen to understand the wider aims of the project. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/soa/Saving_Linux_from_the_lawyers/0,39023769,39223426,00.htm">...Full  Story</a>                                      </p>

At issue is how the state government stores the millions of digital  documents and other public records it creates. The Romney administration wants  documents stored in a particular format that would allow the records to be read  by a variety of software packages -- except Microsoft Office. <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/10/29/senators_question_file_storage_shift/">...Full  Story</a>                                      </p>

The 'technical' beta will be available only to certain big customers,  but a general release is expected early in 2006....However Microsoft has so far  said filters to allow legacy software to use the new formats will be available  only for more recent versions. It seems that this does not include Word 97, for  instance. This could cause confusion in organisations with thousands of  computers, some of them IT antiques. A more long-term, and fundamental,  question about the new formats is whether they can or should qualify as a  standard for cross-platform information exchange. There are calls, including  one from the EC, for international agreement on standard formats that are not  controlled by one company. <a href="http://www.computeractive.co.uk/personal-computer-world/news/2146251/first-beta-office-released">...Full  Story</a>                                      </p>
