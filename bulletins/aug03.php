  If you've read an article about standards recently, there's a good chance that it focused on web services -- but not necessarily on the technical side of things. In recent weeks, the competition has become more open between companies seeking to further their commercial interests through promoting their own web services solutions.

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Beginning with our February issue, we have been following the progress of <em><strong>Rambus v. Infineon</strong></em>, the most-watched legal case in the standard setting world of recent memory (for the factual background and the case of the litigation to date, see: <a href="/bulletins/feb03.php#editorial" target="_ONE">http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb03.php#editorial</a>). Following the refusal by the Federal Circuit to reconsider its decision not to punish Rambus for its prior conduct in the Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC), Infineon made one last effort to prevail, by petitioning the Supreme Court to intervene. If the Supreme Court does not grant Infineon's petition, motion, the decision of the lower court will stand. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many were astonished when the Federal Circuit Court refused to punish Rambus, especially since a jury in the original trial had found that Rambus had committed fraud. So great was this astonishment that a wide variety of constituencies have independently decided to file a compelling range of amici curiae (literally, &quot;friends of the court&quot;) briefs in support of Infineon's plea to the Supreme Court to intervene. Those briefs represent the combined weight of ANSI accredited SDOs, consortia, semiconductor companies, JEDEC, the Attorneys General of 16 states and commonwealths, and a patent professional -- truly, an impressive range of interests, all of which have taken the time, trouble and expense to file lengthy and closely-reasoned opinions from diverse perspectives in support of overturning the lower courts decision.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without question, the veritable barrage of briefs should suffice to get the serious attention of the high Court. But will they be sufficient to persuade the Justices to allocate their scarce time to the dispute? Only time, as they say, will tell. The announcement could come as early as October.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The briefs were filed by:</font></p>

The game is afoot!&quot; In so doing, he employed both meanings of the word &quot;game.&quot; First, as in a valuable quarry, and second, in the sense of a competitive challenge against a wily opponent. For better or worse, engaging in standard setting is often played as the same sort of game: the pursuit of a valuable standards goal, often in competition with others who are seeking to capture the prize instead. At the moment, &quot;web services&quot; is the name of the biggest game, and many companies are jockeying to have final standards reflect their individual strategic best interests.</font></p>

Not only are diverse standard setting organizations competing to set standards in this area, but individual companies -- and ad hoc coalitions of companies -- are jockeying to get their web services proposals adopted by leading standard setting organizations over rival submissions. At the same time, the debate continues over whether the benefits of web services standards will begin to be enjoyed soon, years from now, never, or all of the above.

At the one extreme, the holy grail is to have your product become the next Microsoft Windows -- a de facto standard owned by a single vendor. Since such successes are far and few between, there is another extreme: setting standards collaboratively in accredited SDOs or unaccredited consortia. When stakes are high, however, efforts frequently emerge that attempt to split the difference. In some cases, it may be deemed expedient to produce a standard (or prototype standard) in a collaborative group and then offer it to an existing standards body that might not otherwise have been interested in launching the effort internally, or perhaps may not have been capable of achieving the same result in the same time period. In other cases, the effort is motivated by a desire to influence the ultimate result by creating the work in an environment where the creators hold all of the cards. When the results of the latter type of efforts are offered to standard setting organizations, it raises difficult questions for the proposed recipient, whose reputation as an open environment is at stake. The following two articles describe two efforts to initiate a web services standard outside of the normal process, and then transfer it into that process.</em></font></td>

Arjuna Technologies, Fujitsu Software, Iona Technologies, Oracle, and Sun have teamed up to propose that individual Web services be called up and combined to form &quot;composite applications.&quot; &#8230; Among the standards bodies that might receive the Sun proposal are the Oasis Open consortium of vendors setting XML standards; the World Wide Web Consortium; and the Internet Engineering Task Force. </font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>InformationWeek, July 1, 2003</strong> - Executives from many of the biggest IT vendors gathered in San Francisco this week to share thoughts on building the agile, or adaptive, enterprise, and two opposing themes jumped out: While Web services are the odds-on favorite to help create business agility, IT departments aren't designed to change as quickly as the companies they support. Web services are growing more important, but the business world has yet to take full advantage of their potential, said Chris Thomas, Chief E-strategist for the Solutions Market Development Group at Intel&#8230;Thomas pointed to the nonprofit RosettaNet consortium, which has processed $5 billion worth of transactions in its effort to establish open standards for E-business processes, as an example of early Web-services success. He also noted that chemical provider Air Products and Chemicals Inc. has saved $1.5 million by using XML to eliminate one customer touch point in its transaction processes, and that it also has seen a 20% reduction in transactional errors. </font></p>

Hence, any requirement to give away their standards would force them to adjust their business model.

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In December of 2002 we created the first issue of the Consortium Standards Bulletin. Our goal in launching this new publication was to fill a perceived void in the technical press. True, news sources such as CNET and InfoWorld are paying increasing attention to standards development, but nowhere is there a place where all of the news relating to standards and standard setting is aggregated, analyzed and presented in a coherent fashion. Nor is there a place where readers can go to reliably find news and analysis on topics such as government policy, antitrust issues and international developments involving standards. Finally, there is no journal that is dedicated exclusively to the examination of the higher-level importance and impact of standards on the world in a consistent and thoughtful fashion.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the first seven issues of the CSB, we attempted to fill all of these needs through a single publication, providing an editorial, a lead article and a &quot;trends&quot; piece, all relating to a single theme which was the focus of that issue. In addition, we provided links to scores of the most important press releases and stories in the preceding month, as well as updates on evolving situations and stories.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What became clear to us over time was that we were combining two types of publications into one: a journal providing thought provoking articles and a news aggregating service. This somewhat schizophrenic approach blurred the purpose of the publication, and also resulted in a publication of rather intimidating length. As a result, we have decided to bifurcate the Consortium Standards Bulletin, and offer two electronic publications (both free) in place of one: The Consortium Standards Journal and the Consortium Standards Bulletin. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the future, you will receive the Consortium Standards Journal on a bimonthly basis, beginning in September of 2003. It will continue to present themed issues containing editorial, feature, trend and other original articles. On a monthly basis, you will receive the Consortium Standards Bulletin, which will have a new and improved format intended to make it more useful: </font></p>
                <div align="left">
                  <ul>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Each issue will begin with a &quot;News Cluster&quot; -- a collection of press releases and articles from the trade and popular press on a given area of standards which is attracting a high degree of attention, such as wireless, web services or RFID Tags. <br>
                      </font></li>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each news item included will have an introductory annotation that will tie it into the overall themes which are evolving in the news, and which have been covered in previous issues of the Consortium Standards Bulletin, the Consortium Standards Journal or at the ConsortiumInfo.org website.<br>
                      </font></li>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead of including links to all recent articles in each issue, we will select and include only the most important stories, so that once a month you can efficiently get up to speed on what is happening in the world of standards. Of course, you can still visit the News and Events section of ConsortiumInfo.org to find all of the most important news, aggregated and pre-screened to exclude the &quot;non-news&quot; from the real news. <br>
                      </font></li>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The news shorts included will continue to be sorted by category, and each category will end with a link back to the News and Events section of ConsortiumInfo.org. By clicking on that link, you will be able to find not just additional stories that have been added since the last issue of the CSB in the same category, but an archive of all news items added since December of 2002. </font></li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Always remember that we add news items to the News and Events section of ConsortiumInfo.org on a daily basis. To stay current on all of the news of interest to the standards world, carefully aggregated, selected, annotated and categorized, simply bookmark <a href="/news/">http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/ </a></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So with two publications for the price of one (free) one, we'll continue to bring you the news, from more sources and in more detail than ever before.
