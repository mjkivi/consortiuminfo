                <p align="left"> <span class="style2">In this issue, we consider what responsibilities information and communications standard setting organizations should have regarding social concerns. Our choice of this theme is inspired by a number of recent developments in this area. </span></p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> While the accredited standards organizations of the world have long been open to all stakeholders, their traditional purpose has been to create standards that are implemented by commercial entities. Perhaps as a result, consumer and civic groups have historically had little interest in participating in the standard setting process. Consortia have been even more dominated by commercial interests, and have promoted membership only to supply-chain participants such as vendors, commercial customers, universities and government agencies. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> The result is that ICT standards have to date largely been created in order to serve the goals of vendors. This may be about to change, however, occasioned by the success and potential of the Internet. And so we are dedicating this issue to a review of some of the efforts that are in play today to bring social responsibility to the top of the Internet standard setting agenda. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In our Editorial, we consider the inevitability of increasing government involvement in the &ldquo;governance&rdquo; of the Internet and the Web, and conclude that standard setting organizations must embrace, rather than resist, this trend in order to ensure that technical excellence, as well as social responsiveness, will continue to enable the further evolution of these vital global resources. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In our Feature Article, we report on the status of the ongoing World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which is charged by the United Nations with developing a plan for ensuring that all of the world&rsquo;s peoples have equal access to the educational, economic and other benefits that Internet access can provide. The results of the WSIS may have a significant impact on the future governance of the Internet and the Web. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> Our Trends Article focuses on social responsibility in an even broader context, reporting briefly on the decision of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to develop an international guideline for social responsibility -- its first venture outside the technical standard setting arena. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> Finally, our Standards Blog selection for this month reflects on the fact that social standards must sometimes be interpreted flexibly through the perceptions of the times rather than mechanistically, if they are to continue to be useful. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> Underlying each of these articles is the recognition that standards, by their very nature, are consensual agreements to voluntarily conform for the common good. Thus, while technology standards are in the first instance commercial in nature, they are nonetheless based upon a fundamental belief that only through cooperation can competitors and related parties secure a mutual benefit. While admitting non-commercial stakeholders into the existing process will result in new strains and sometimes unwelcome compromises for traditional participants, the good news is that the fundamental concepts of the standard setting process are compatible with these new challenges. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> Acknowledging that the standard setting process is first about consensus, and only secondarily about technology, leads to the realization that standard setting organizations are inherently able &ndash; if they choose to -- to lead the way in meeting the needs of a global society. The alternative is for them to be ignored by larger societal and political forces, and perhaps to be replaced by new organizations that will be less responsive to historical stakeholders, and less capable to do what needs to be done for the benefit of old and new parties alike. </p>

              <p align="left"> <strong><em> </em></strong></p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style2">Do information and communications technology (ICT) standard setting organizations (SSOs) have social responsibilities? If so, which SSOs? And just as importantly, who is entitled to answer these questions? </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Many of those who spend their lives in the very commercial trenches of ICT standard setting might view the first question with surprise, the second with puzzlement, and the third with outright hostility, to the extent that it implies that others besides themselves are entitled to impose rules on the technology standard setting process. And if those same individuals are immersed in highly technical and deeply embedded standards, their reaction would be understandable. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> But what about the technology standards that enable the Internet and the Web? On the one hand, much of the standards activity in these areas focuses purely on technical issues. But other initiatives involve more fundamental matters, such as deciding which languages the Internet will support, and whether there will be equal access to domain names among all countries. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Today, the Internet and the Web are demonstrating their promised potential of providing a means of instant communication between all of the world&rsquo;s peoples, conjoined with universal freedom of expression and access to knowledge. The possibility for good to come from these new technologies is enormous. But will the immediate future present a widening digital divide, with First World users enjoying pervasive broadband access and ubiquitous wireless devices, while Third World residents languish in an ICT-deprived backwater? Or will the further evolution and deployment of the Internet and the Web be managed with the aim of narrowing, and even eliminating such a disparity? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> It is not surprising that the wider world, and particularly the United Nations, has begun to take an active interest in ensuring that the latter alternative will be realized. As noted in our Feature Article in this issue, a multi-year initiative is in process that will culminate in a report to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2005. That report will contain recommendations for initiating a degree of global and national control over the &ldquo;governance&rdquo; of the Internet. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> It is certainly true that the Internet and the Web are emerging from an age of innocence, after a heady and free-form youth. In fact, the Internet has come full circle, having been launched by The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), and supported throughout its early years through the largesse of the United States federal budget. Over time, and especially with the advent of the World Wide Web, commercial entities, consumers, education and government have all enthusiastically climbed on board. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> How could the Internet not begin to attract the attention of local, national and international government? Increasingly, the Internet is becoming the &ldquo;enabler of everything,&rdquo; from telecommunications (Voice over IP), to financial transactions, to emergency response, to wide area networks of every conceivable nature and use. In a very real sense, the Internet and the Web have become as essential to the conduct, and even the existence, of society as are clean water supplies and adequate electricity. Ten years from now, the Internet will likely be categorized in anyone&rsquo;s mind as simply another utility. For better or worse, complete resistance by the technical community to government intervention is doubtless futile. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> But if the involvement of government in the &ldquo;governance&rdquo; of the Internet and the Web are indeed inevitable, what does &ldquo;governance&rdquo; entail, and who will make that call? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> At the moment, there is little consensus, but some unease in high-tech quarters over how these questions will be answered. Will United Nations bureaucrats be able to differentiate between what is purely technical and what has the potential for societal impact? And will the organizations that have served so well to date to provide the standards for the Internet and the Web be left to themselves, or will they be regulated &ndash; or worse yet &ndash; replaced? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Moreover, unlike other utilities, which are most often regulated only at the national level, the Internet and the Web will be subject to pressure to satisfy the disparate opinions and circumstances of all of the world's peoples (not to mention the kind of horse trading that goes on in any political arena). How will consensus be achieved among such a diverse constituency, and how disruptive will the process be to the ongoing technical evolution of the Internet and the Web? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Such prospects inevitably lead one to ask, is international &quot;governance&quot; of the Internet and the Web inevitable? We think it is, although the degree and nature of such governance remains to be determined. The lessons of history are far too clear to assume that resources with such enormous potential to favorably affect the future of humanity will escape an increasing level of attention from government. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> If this proves to be the case, some level of frustration and regrettable comprises will lie ahead as the Internet and the Web are increasingly subjugated to the will of government, just as more traditional utilities have become regulated in the past. The Internet and the Web are about to become victims of their own success, in the sense that engineering experts may no longer have the freedom of action that they enjoyed when a fully deployed and popularly utilized Internet was just a dream. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> But at the same time, it is important to recognize the differences between the creation of the Internet and the Web, and the building of the infrastructure that underlies traditional utilities. Those that built the first telephone and telegraph lines, the oil fields and the railroads were the founders of joint-stock companies that were unabashedly and solely concerned with making a profit. Indeed, standard setting bodies did not even come into existence until most of these areas of commerce were well established. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In contrast, the Internet and the Web were born in a largely non-commercial setting, and the standards that make each possible have been developed by well-established, open, consensus-driven processes. In the case of the World Wide Web Consortium especially, social responsibility has been a core value since its inception, as demonstrated by its manifest commitment to universal access. Similarly, the Unicode Consortium exists for the sole purpose of ensuring that as many languages and character sets as possible (240 and 50, respectively, at this time) are supported by the Internet. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In short, there is already in existence a means by which socially responsible goals may be pursued and secured. But only if those now involved in standard setting embrace, rather than resist, the inevitable intrusion of government will they be likely to maintain an ongoing seat at the governance table. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> If one assumes &ndash; and we do &ndash; that the frontier days of the Internet and the Web are coming to an end, then it is incumbent on all of those that are active in standard setting in this area to  join  in the WSIS and similar processes. Only by engaging and fully participating as this process evolves will it be possible to state as plainly as possible what is fair game for political influence, and what is technical and should be decided on technical merit alone. Those that are best equipped to make that distinction must engage &ndash; for the good of us all. </p>

              <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Introduction: </span> </em></strong><span class="style2"> On December 21, 2001, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed Resolution 56/183, endorsing the convening of a &ldquo;World Summit on the Information Society,&rdquo; or WSIS. Realizing that goal would involve raising millions of Swiss Francs in cash and in-kind support from interested nations, the accrediting of participants from government, the private sector, NGOs and other interest groups, and the planning of not one, but two, major international conferences. The first was held on December 10 &ndash; 12, 2003, in Geneva, Switzerland, with 11,000 participants from 175 countries in attendance. The second, and final, meeting will be held in Tunis, Tunisia, on November 16 &ndash; 18, 2005.</span></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> The Geneva meeting resulted in a number of decisions, as well as the ratification of a detailed Declaration of Principles, and a related Plan of Action. These two formal documents contain a multitude of laudable affirmations and goals, recognizing the vast potential that information and communications technologies (ICTs) have to benefit humanity. But the documents also express concern that these benefits will not be equitably shared by all absent coordinated action on the part of the United Nations and national governments to ensure that result. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Most of the implementation goals contained in the Plan of Action are neutral or positive with respect to the work plans of the standard setting organizations (SSOs) that enable the Internet, the Web and related telecommunications services, devices and software. But some strike closer to home, with one in particular catching the attention of many. That goal claims the right for world government to become involved in &ldquo;the governance of the Internet.&rdquo; </p>

True, the motivations of some of the most influential visionaries behind these new technologies, such as Tim Berners-Lee, have been informed by the good that could be achieved through the creation of royalty-free knowledge and communications resources. But those motivations have been at a high and generalized level. In contrast, consider the more specific goals embodied in the WSIS Declaration of Principles: </em></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Arguably, no governmental involvement at the technical level at all may be needed to achieve such goals, given the more immediate and daunting challenge of providing millions of new Third World access points to the Internet as a first step in achieving any social goals. But the Declarations also include language that touches on technical decisions, such as the following: &ldquo;We agree that to meet these challenges, all stakeholders should work together to:&hellip;create an enabling environment at all levels; develop and widen ICT technologies; [and] foster and respect cultural diversity.&rdquo; [Declaration B.19] Even leaving technical decisions aside, this type of goal could lead to the types of mandatory, multiple translations that bog down the operations of some existing world and regional governmental structures. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> There are other goals that are clearly technical in nature: </p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style2">Such goals are central to the work of many SSOs. However, to date, government involvement in these organizations has been relatively light, and has most often been manifested at the participatory, rather than the regulatory level. Greater and more determined involvement at the national and international level by governments and the United Nations would hold both the promise of more effective and consistent controls of the abusers that hide behind international boundaries, while at the same time changing the dynamics of existing SSOs. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> There is also a reassuring affirmation of the vital role that standards play: </p>

The Internet and the Web are undeniably of vital world importance, and the world is becoming more dependent upon them on a daily basis. The Internet governance structure that has evolved to date has been technically effective, but it does not have a democratic basis in the traditional sense of being subject to broad public supervision, or being managed under an all-inclusive, democratic, representative process. And, in fact, there have been inequities of administration and access that have often been noted by those who have been adversely impacted, such as the fact that Stanford University has been assigned more domain addresses than all of China. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Still, the following words from the Plan of Action are enough to raise the concern of any engineer in an SSO working group: </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> The Declarations of Principle and the Plan of Action are less specific in this regard. Most of the detailed activities in the Plan involve setting &ldquo;e-strategies&rdquo; that would serve goals such as development, or calling for programs to stem illiteracy. Other items in the Plan, however, call for studies by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to explore the feasibility of more diverse and pervasive broadband services [Plan of Action C2.9.d] and to foster &ldquo;increased awareness, assessment and evaluation of different software models and licenses.&rdquo; [Plan of Action C3.10.j] </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In areas such as these, will governments defer to technical experts on technical issues, or will the types of interconnecting compromises that blur other international decisions affect standard setting as well?

In fact, one of the first tasks of the new working group is to &ldquo;develop a working definition of Internet governance&quot;. Its other tasks include: </p>

                    <p class="style2"> iii) develop a common understanding of the respective roles and responsibilities of governments, existing intergovernmental and international organizations and other forums as well as the private sector and civil society from both developing and developed countries; </p>
                    <span class="style2">iv) prepare a report on the results of this activity to be presented for consideration and appropriate action for the second phase of WSIS in Tunis in 2005. [Plan of Action C6.b] </span></td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p align="left"> <span class="style2">In short, to paraphrase Georges Clemenceau, the participants in the first phase of the WSIS have concluded that the Internet is too important to be left to the engineers. It is somewhat discomforting, however, to learn that the decision has been taken to assume the right to govern, first, and determine what that means only second. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> How big a genie is out of the bottle? It&rsquo;s hard to say at this time, but ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, has been singled out by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan for criticism over its control of domain names. It hasn&rsquo;t helped that Verisign sued ICANN earlier this year, alleging contract violations and antitrust abuses. Nor has it gone unnoticed in the wider world that the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe have a disproportionate interest in controlling domain names specifically, and Internet standards generally. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> More disturbing are statements such as that of Khalid Saeed, Pakistan&rsquo;s secretary of the Ministry of Information Technology, who stated that Pakistan must &ldquo;play an active role in all layers&rdquo; of the organizations that control the Internet. Given that representatives from any country are already entitled to participate in all such organizations, there is a danger that the situation could become sufficiently politicized to engender artificial &ndash; and harmful &ndash; &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> At the same time, of course, it should be noted that the United Nations embarks on many activities, and adopts many resolutions, that are roundly ignored by nations whose cooperation is essential to give them meaning. In consequence, it may be more useful to view the WSIS process as emblematic that a milestone has been passed, beyond which the Internet and the Web will increasingly become the focus of active government interest. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> What the impact social concerns may have on the Internet and the Web cannot be guessed at this time. Perhaps the future will hold nothing more than the type of regulation that other telecommunications services and standards have encountered. Or, perhaps, the concept of &quot;governance&quot; will take hold, and something far different may lie ahead. Given that uncertainty, the standard setting organizations that are involved in enabling the Internet and the Web would be wise to prepare for either contingency. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em> Conclusions:</em></strong> Where is the WSIS process likely to lead? While it's more common in journalism to be an alarmist than a pragmatist, following the latter path is usually more productive. It could hardly be assumed that anything as important and enabling as the Internet and the Web would escape significant government attention forever. As observed by the W3C&rsquo;s Danny Weitzner in a CNET News.com piece posted on April 6, 2004: &ldquo;Simply put, the era in which the Internet technology design can pretend to be neutral as to public policy and social needs is over.&rdquo; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> And in fact, the Internet needs government involvement in any event. Current cybersecurity threats and spam can doubtless only be curtailed (if they can be countered at all) through worldwide coordination at the government level. And recently a number of new advocacy groups have been formed by technology companies for the specific goal of involving government more directly in solving cybersecurity issues. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> We believe that the way forward is clear: organizations such as the W3C and the IETF need to embrace, rather than resist, the inevitably growing level of interest that governments will take in the Internet and the Web. Happily, the W3C (in particular) has a history of engaging and involving government, as well as a culture of social responsibility in its activities from its inception. SSOs will serve their goals best by establishing themselves as essential partners in the WSIS process and whatever else may follow. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The time for securing a seat near the head of the Internet governance table is certainly now, while the definition of governance is still being worked out, as respect for engineering principals will be as important as social values if we are to have a robust, as well as a socially responsible, Internet to serve us in the future. </p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style2">ISO, the International Organization for Standardization, has decided to break new ground in its standard setting activities. While its preexisting scope has been broad indeed, its historical mission has been limited to the world of technical standards. Its new initiative will move in a very different direction, seeking to set out guidelines for the exercise of social responsibility by organizations. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In a press release dated June 30, 2004, ISO announced that the decision had been made at a meeting held in Stockholm in late June that drew representatives from equal numbers of developed and developing countries (with 33 countries in each category). Participants represented business, government, labor, consumers, international and nongovernmental organizations. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The decision taken at the meeting to establish a working group to address the topic of social responsibility followed on the report of an Advisory Group formed in early 2003 to recommend whether or not ISO should become involved in this area, and if so, what the nature and scope of any resulting standard should be. The Advisory Group&rsquo;s activities included surveying the social responsibility guidelines established by numerous other organizations in reaching a decision. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Following the endorsement of the Advisory Group's recommendations and the input of those attending the meeting, the new Working Group was tasked with creating a &ldquo;guidance document, written in plain language which is understandable and usable by non-specialists, and not for a specification document intended for conformity assessment.&rdquo; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The resolution authorizing the new Working Group also charts a deliberate course among the work products already released by other international bodies. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Specifically, the Working Group is instructed to supplement, rather than seek to supplant, intergovernmental agreements such as the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and those adopted by the International Labour Organization (and indeed, the Working Group is instructed to actively cooperate with the ILO). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In keeping with the subject matter of the initiative, an effort will be made to provide funding assistance to those whose participation might not otherwise be possible. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Whether or not this new initiative marks a new direction that will expand within ISO, or whether this new focus will inform or affect the activities of ISO in technical areas as well remains to be seen. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style42">[] [] July 4, 2004 </p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style55"><font size="3"><strong class="style56"><em>#18</em></strong> </font></span><span class="style7"><em class="style38"><strong><strong><em> <em>              <em> Standards, the Constitution and (Im)Mutability</em> </em></em></strong></strong></em></span><span class="style2">The 4th of July offers an appropriate opportunity to ask an intriguing question: Must standards evolve in order to remain unchanged? </span></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Whether you regard that question to be absurd or important will depend upon your view of what a standard actually is. Looked at purely from a mechanistic point of view, the question is inherently contradictory. After all, does not the concept of a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; necessitate a fixed reference point against which something else may be measured? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In fact, no. How can that be? Because, as so often is the case, obtaining a useful answer is dependent on completely understanding the question itself. If one (appropriately) takes a utilitarian approach, a standard is a tool that is used to meet a specific need. It exists only for the purpose of satisfying that need, and not because it possesses any intrinsic meaning or value. If the need that gives rise to the standard changes due to extrinsic factors, then so also must the standard change, if it will continue to be useful. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The better question to begin with, then, is not &ldquo;what is a standard?&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;why is a standard?&rdquo; The answer to that question not only permits, but indeed requires, that a standard be permitted to evolve. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Consider, for example, the concept of a speed limit on a highway. Surely, as we all &ldquo;know,&rdquo; this is a safety standard. But in fact, speed limits in the United States have at times had nothing to do with safety issues at all. During World War II, the speed limit on all open roads in the United States was 35 miles per hour, neither more nor less. The reason? 35 miles an hour was the most fuel-efficient speed for automotive engines of that era, and gasoline was in short supply, given the competing demands of the armed forces. Moreover, a faster speed would have resulted in increased tire wear, and the Dutch East Indies were no longer supplying the United States with natural rubber. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In a more current sense, consider this: What (and &ldquo;why&rdquo;?) is a valuable wireless laptop standard? From an end-user point of view, it is not 802.11a, 802.11b or their successors (or, necessarily, an 802.11 family standard at all), but whatever the best currently available standard may be that permits reliable, easily configured, inexpensive, secure wireless communication with optimal bandwidth. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Significantly, the successive versions of the 802.11 &ldquo;Wi-Fi&rdquo; standard have not been intended simply to increase performance, but to address other evolving needs as well. The forces driving those needs have even been geopolitical. Witness, for example, the push to add enhanced security features to Wi-Fi not only to address technical needs, but to counter China&rsquo;s contention that it had no choice but to create a home-grown wireless standard that, incidentally, would also permit it to erect a significant trade barrier to non-domestic manufacturers. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Which finally takes us deep enough into the issue to reflect on the mutability of standards on this U.S. Independence Day. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In the 216 years since the United States Constitution was ratified, it has been the standard against which all new laws enacted in the U.S. must be tested. But like the many IT standards that fall short of guaranteeing immediate interoperability, it not only needs to be periodically amended (as it has been -- 26 times to date), but it must be interpreted as well. The Architecture Board that hears the disputes, of course, is the United States Supreme Court. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Amending and interpreting a constitution, like amending and interpreting an IT standard, is a devilishly tricky business. Every IT standard (and a political constitution is no different) is the product of multiple compromises, often painfully derived, that eventually lead to the final consensus decision. By the time that most standard have been approved, a delicate balance between competing interests has been achieved, and no one looks forward to upsetting that result. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Still, without the ability to evolve and to be interpreted in light of current circumstances, a standard remains static, and eventually often becomes useless. Such a standard &ndash; or constitution -- will eventually fail to meet the need for which it was created (as the United States learned, at great cost, in the run up to the Civil War). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> At the end of the day, whether one is attending a standards meeting or evaluating the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, one must ultimately focus on the need that is being addressed by the tool at hand, and not invest an inflexible and totemic value in the tool itself. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Notwithstanding the strong emotions that constitutional discussions often evoke, the United States has not done too badly in that regard. After all, its Constitution is the longest-serving written standard of its type in the world today. Without judicious amendment, the independence wisely granted by the founders of the Republic to the court that interprets it, and the wisdom of those who have served on that court, the Constitution's capacity to remain immutably effective would never have been possible. </p>

Now, the IEEE proposes to not only solve the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; problem in a way that would theoretically enable broadband access to anyone with a power company willing to offer the service, but eliminate home wiring issues as well. Of course, once the service is widely deployed, it will not only bring broadband access to those who currently have no alternative to dial-up service, but will impose new price competition to the benefit of those that do as well. </em> </em></em> </em></td>

              </strong><strong>Business Wire, Piscataway, N.J., July 20, 2004 --</strong> The ability to send high-speed digital data over the power lines between substations and homes and offices is attracting increasing attention because it can make every wall outlet a portal to the Internet. In seeking to help realize this potential, the IEEE has begun to develop IEEE P1675(TM), &quot;Standard for Broadband over Power Line Hardware.&quot; When finished, IEEE P1675 will give electric utilities a comprehensive standard for installing the required hardware on distribution lines, both underground and overhead, which provide the infrastructure for broadband-over-power-line (BPL) systems. It also will include installation requirements for the protection of those who work on BPL equipment and to ensure such systems do not place the public at risk. The standard is targeted for completion in mid 2006. ,,,<a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20040720005552&newsLang=en">Full Story</a> </p>

              </a></strong><strong>NIST Tech Beat, July 15, 2004 -- </strong> Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a new performance standard for &ldquo;across-the-road&rdquo; radar speed-measuring device systems to help law enforcement agencies to purchase and use with confidence this relatively new method for catching speeders. Unlike conventional &ldquo;down-the-road&rdquo; radar speed-measuring devices, across-the-road radar systems do not require an operator and can be programmed to detect and record vehicles traveling above a predetermined speed. In addition, these devices can be set to look selectively for cars, motorcycles or trucks. The newer systems are also less likely to be detected by speeders because the radar beam used is pointed across, rather than along the road.

                <strong> Mumbai, Business Standard, July 8, 2004 --</strong> An ISO standard for IT service management, along the lines of BS 15000, is expected to be in place by 2005-06....The information technology service management forum (ITSMF), a UK-based non-profit organization with over 1000 member companies including Hewlett Packard, Microsoft and IBM, approached the International Organization of Standardization with a proposal to fast track the ISO certification for IT service management.... The standardisation will have a special relevance for India which has emerged as a global offshoring hotspot. &ldquo;With the coming of the 24-hour, follow the sun global delivery model, it is necessary that people are equipped to speak the same language and understand the same value propositions,&rdquo; said Peter van der Fluit, vice president, software global business unit, Hewlett Packard. The country which is riding the IT wave even in the domestic industry with computerisation of its banking systems, e-governance etc is now combating qualitative problems like failed projects, overshooting budgets or running out on time....<a href="http://www.business-standard.com/iceworld/storypage.php?hpFlag=Y&chklogin=N&autono=160753&leftnm=lmnu9&leftindx=9&lselect=0">Full Story</a></p>

              </span></strong><span class="style2"><strong>NIST Tech Beat, July 2, 2004 --</strong> Inadequacies in managing inventory, scheduling and accounting information cost the automotive and electronics industries a combined total of almost $9 billion annually, according to a newly released study commissioned by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Almost all of these costs could be eliminated with optimally integrated systems for exchanging information throughout supply chains, the study concludes.... An underlying problem, according to the study, is the lack of universally accepted and implemented standards for the format and content of messages that flow between supply chain partners. This reduces opportunities for cost savings and leads to duplication of effort, maintenance of redundant systems, and investment in inefficient processes such as manual entry of data when machine sources are available. ...<a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2004_0702.htm#lack">Full Story

Earlier this year, the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a global consortium working towards increased adoption of Linux worldwide, accepted membership of Beijing Software Testing Center (BSTC), China's largest software testing organization. Founded two years ago by the Beijing Government Science and Technology Commission and Beijing Products Quality and Inspection Institute, BSTC plans to focus on Linux testing and development of internationalization features for Linux.... Prior to signing in BSTC, OSDL also accepted early this year membership of another Chinese software organization -- the Beijing Co-create Open Source Software Company -- which is one of China&rsquo;s leading open source software development firms. Founded by 10 other Chinese software vendors, the company plans to focus on Linux kernel development and the promotion of the Linux desktop in the country.... <a href="http://asia.cnet.com/newstech/industry/0,39001142,39186035,00.htm">Full Story </a></span></p>
