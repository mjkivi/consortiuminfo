                <p align="left" class="style2"> Anyone returning to the standards scene after a long absence might feel strangely like Dorothy arriving in the land of Oz: the landscape in the distance looks very different from what it used to. Continuing where we left off in our last issue, we explore what may lie ahead. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Last month we reviewed the Open Source phenomenon from a business perspective, looking at what must be done before Open Source software becomes ubiquitous in the business world

 (see: <strong><em><a href="/bulletins/aug04.php">Open Source &ndash; Coming of Age?</a></em></strong>) </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> This month, we take a broader view, examining why Open Source and similar non-remunerative collaborative projects have become so common. Is it just because the Internet and the Web have made them possible, or is there something more profound going on? </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In doing so, we look at how collaborative projects fit into the standard setting infrastructure, highlighting what is different and what is the same in comparison to more traditional means of achieving kindred goals &ndash; and what unique advantages can be gained by employing these new methodologies in preference to legacy processes. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">We also take pleasure in welcoming a guest author to this issue: David Galiel, a visionary with his own non-profit, commons-based Web-deployed project, and some intriguing ideas about why &ldquo;networked peer production&rdquo; has become such a popular and productive model for creative endeavor. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">As always, we hope that you find this issue intriguing. If you have your own ideas to share, please let us know. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Twentieth century visionary Marshall McLuhan is remembered today not only for his probative and creative thinking about modern life, but also for his ability to coin pithy word images that aptly summed up matters of social import. Examples still in use today include the phrase &ldquo;global village&rdquo; and the now ubiquitous words &ldquo;the media&rdquo;, which rapidly supplanted the &ldquo;the press&rdquo; as proper usage in the increasingly TV-driven world of the late twentieth century. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">Another McLuhan phrase that is less remembered today is this: &ldquo;The Medium is the Message&rdquo; (being the title of a book he coauthored in 1967). But while the phrase has faded, the observations he presented in that work remain of profound relevance today. In explaining the title, the authors observed that &quot;societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication.&quot; </p>

One reason is this: unlike television and radio, which allow commercial interests to unilaterally push their views at the populace, the Internet and the Web permit unmediated peer to peer interactions responsive to the desires and creativity of those at the ends of the network connections. How different than the commercial reality of radio and television, which McLuhan observed permitted &quot;the media [to] work us over completely&hellip;so pervasive are they in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, or unaltered'. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In a very different way, the phrase &ldquo;the medium is the message&rdquo; is even more meaningful when applied to the Web than it was applicable to the media of the 1960s. While television and radio permit a more vivid form of communication than newspapers, the dynamics are otherwise much the same. True, the potential for influence and manipulation are augmented by the power of the television medium, but the power relationships among those involved remain the same. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In contrast, the Web fundamentally changes the relationships of those that choose to take advantage of its potential. More importantly, it also allows relationships to emerge that were impossible to create in a pre-networked world. Not surprisingly, new practices and aspirations have found expression using this radically different enabling medium than existed before. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">How radical are these new practices? Witness projects as varied as the Open Source movement, the Wikipedia, and the Project Gutenberg electronic publishing project, each of which is the work of many uncompensated individuals that are unknown one to another, and often publicly unacknowledged as well. What motivates them to contribute their time and energy to such novel endeavors?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> What indeed? People are still people, and therefore it must be the medium that makes the difference. <strong></strong>Somehow, the speed, power and democracy of the Web allow a reordering of relationships and enable outcomes that motivates those involved to build virtual pyramids that would never have been erected any other way.<strong> </strong></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> As these projects grow and proliferate, it appears that this is no transitory phase in the evolution of the Web. While experimentation is certain to continue (with ever more interesting results), something fundamentally new has been introduced to the human condition. Unlike so many other modern innovations that have enabled violence, degradation and other adverse consequences, this new medium promises to give expression to what is best about humankind, rather than what is worst. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">And that is a fine message indeed. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Open Source software, however, is only one, and not even the most significant, manifestation of what Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler calls <em>&ldquo;commons-based peer production&rdquo;, </em>a networked model of economic production that is not organized in either markets or businesses&mdash;as virtually all other economic activity is and always has been in capitalist societies. With peer production on the Internet, distributed masses of people share open production of complex products and services, largely for no financial compensation. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">While the idea of non-market, non-corporate production is not new&mdash;science has traditionally worked this way&mdash;large-scale, decentralized, sustained open production, by diverse groups of peers, on a wide variety of focused projects, is a new phenomenon that has been enabled and encouraged by the confluence of computers, networking and the information economy. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> According to capitalist economics, not-for-profit, commons-based peer production should not be happening&mdash;at least not on this scale, producing this degree of consistent quality, in such a diversity of fields. This new dynamic in the marketplace, and the reasons for its growing economic and social significance, stem from the ways new technologies have changed the capitalist &ldquo;rules of the game&rdquo;. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10"><strong><em> Markets and Firms:</em></strong> </span></em></strong>Until recently, virtually all economic activity in our capitalist system was centered on the generation of profit. There have been two practical ways to engage in economic activity: sell something for more than you paid for it, or make something and sell it for more than it cost to make. In turn, there have been two ways to organize the exchanges that enable economic activity: <em>markets</em> and <em>firms</em> (hierarchical corporations).</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In 1937, economic Ronald Coase identified <em>transaction costs</em> as the engine behind the formation of capitalist enterprises. When the transaction cost of a given exchange of goods can be lowered through an intermediary below its natural cost in the marketplace, an opportunity is created for a capitalist enterprise. Conversely, when the open market is more efficient in terms of transaction costs, a corporate intermediary ceases to be viable.</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><strong><em> Information:</em></strong> </strong> There are two radical ways in which information behaves differently than physical property, which used to form the core of our economy. A) <em>The marginal cost of production is zero </em>(once information is produced, it costs essentially nothing for one individual to transfer it to another), and B) <em>the input, or raw material (information), is of the same nature as the output (new information). </em></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As Prof. Lawrence Lessig points out, <em>&ldquo;The crucial feature of this new space is the low cost of digital creation, and the low costs of delivering what gets created.&rdquo;</em><strong class="style10"><strong><em> </em></strong></strong></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><strong><em>Computing power:</em></strong> </strong>                <strong></strong> While there has been some debate as to the precision of Moore&rsquo;s Law (does processing power double every year? Two years? Eighteen months? Will the pace continue?), the principle articulated is merely a special case of a more profound and important phenomenon in technological evolution, which R. Buckminster Fuller identified in the 1920&rsquo;s&mdash;the trend of <em>&ldquo;progressive ephemeralization&rdquo;,</em> or doing more and more with less and less. What this means, in practical terms, is that computers and network technology, the key mediums for production and distribution of information, continue to become more and more accessible, at lower and lower cost, to more and more people. The potential pool for peer production is rapidly expanding. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em> <strong><em> Network technology:</em></strong> </em></strong> Networks themselves have characteristics that make them economically unique. The now familiar Metcalfe&rsquo;s law states that <em>the value of a communication system grows at approximately the square of the number of users of the system. </em>This means that, in defiance of the classic laws of supply and demand, the more ubiquitous and accessible a network is, the greater its value becomes. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The combination of ephemeralization and Metcalfe&rsquo;s law has a determinant effect on the utility of hierarchical corporations as a vehicle for economic activity, because <em>they push the trend of transaction costs for information exchange towards zero. </em>This trend does not favor corporate solutions. And yet, certain forms of information production require the kind of collective effort of many people that corporations traditionally afford. This creates a growing opportunity vacuum that peer production enterprises increasingly fill. </p>
				  <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em><strong><em>Group-Forming Networks: </em></strong> </em></strong></span>That alone, however, is insufficient to explain the explosion of not-for-profit peer production projects in recent years. Less well known than Metcalfe&rsquo;s law, but of even greater significance, is David P. Reed&rsquo;s Law of Group-Forming Networks (GFNs). Group-forming networks are networks like the Internet that support the development of sub-communities, affiliating sub-groupings of network members, enabled by many-to-many communication tools like email lists, discussions forums, Weblogs and chat. Reed has found that the <em>utility of large-networks, particularly social networks like the Internet, can scale exponentially with the size of the network. </em>If the value of physical networks grows at a rate of n&sup2;, the value of GFNs grows at the accelerating rate of 2<sup>n</sup>. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This confluence of new conditions enables peer production to emerge as a significant alternative to the traditional market/firm system, when productive activity is not best served by that system. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">It still does not explain, however, <em>why</em> people choose to participate in such activity. There is largely no profit in it, there is often no fame in it (major projects like Apache don&rsquo;t even credit individual contributors), and, while most Open Source coders are motivated by the sheer pleasure of tackling complex technical challenges, that doesn&rsquo;t quite explain why masses of people voluntarily participate in a rather tedious process like Distributed Proofreaders, created independently to support Project Gutenberg. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Project Gutenberg is a peer production effort to digitize public domain books. Volunteers manually enter the text of a book, and other volunteers proof-read it for accuracy. Distributed Proofreaders breaks down works entered by Project Gutenberg participants into individual pages, which are then randomly assigned to volunteers who sign up at the Distributed Proofreaders site. The project has dramatically accelerated the output of Project Gutenberg, becoming the main source of its e-books in less than two years. Clearly, the rewards (in any traditional sense) for such activity are not self-evident. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10"><strong><em> The value-driven enterprise:</em></strong></span></em></strong>Most discussion about peer production has focused on the novel <em>means</em>&mdash;production occurring on a large scale outside the market/corporate system. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">I believe that there is something else going on. This newly available means of networked peer production is catalyzing activity that is not just a new means to make the same old stuff. To understand it&mdash;to understand how the <em>ends</em> of the process of production will be critically changed by these new means&mdash;we need to look at the most neglected part of human economic activity: <em>purpose. </em></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In 1995 a former IBM programmer named Craig Newmark started keeping track of interesting events in the San Francisco area and telling people he knew about them. Word spread, and Craig started an email list to keep everyone notified. He called it &ldquo;craigslist&rdquo;. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">There are now craigslists for more than 45 major cities in the US, providing &ldquo;a trustworthy, efficient means for folks to get the word out regarding everyday stuff, and connect with others in the local community to find jobs, housing, companionship and community&rdquo;. A Forrester report in 2000 confirmed that craigslist was the most effective job site in San Francisco. Craigslist, running entirely on Open Source software, serves as many pages every day as Amazon.com&mdash;with a staff of just 14 people. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">There have been estimates that if craigslist was ever offered for sale, it could be worth as much as $100 million. But craigslist won&rsquo;t be sold. In 1997, Newmark decided not to make craigslist commercial. Craigslist does not even accept banner ads, despite lucrative offers. Nor does craigslist charge the public for using its myriad services, except for a small fee required in three major cities for job postings&mdash;just enough to keep craiglist sustainable, with enough left over to make a difference with the causes important to Craig&mdash;including helping other non-market efforts get off the ground. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">When you listen to the founders of enterprises like craigslist, you sense a very different motivation than the profit-driven rationale that powers traditional market/firm activity. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster told BusinessWeek earlier this month, </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> So what else can we learn from the unique characteristics of these new enabling technologies discussed above? And where can the example of individuals like Craig Newmark and Jimbo Wales lead society in the future? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10"><strong><em> The implications for democracy:</em></strong> </span></em></strong> Historically, t he benefits conveyed by capitalism to society have come at the cost of significant tradeoffs. The pursuit of profit, organized in corporations competing in markets, is at best agnostic to (and often in direct conflict with) the public interest. That is why society has developed a system of checks-and-balances that, in theory, elevates the rule of law above individual and institutional power. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">At the same time, we sacrifice certain individual freedoms, tolerate certain social inequities, and relinquish a degree of democratic oversight, in order to enjoy the benefits of capitalist production. We don&rsquo;t produce wheat democratically, because we are more interested in everyone eating bread. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The layers of authority in hierarchical organizations reduce individual autonomy, while markets introduce social inequities (in fact, they depend on them&mdash;if wealth and the means of production were distributed equally, there would be no market incentive to excel). And neither corporations nor markets are run by democratic means. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">We tolerate and even embrace these tradeoffs, because all historical alternatives have dramatically failed. Nevertheless, all but the most zealous of ideologues recognize the imperfections inherent in capitalist economies. Over time, free societies have employed varying degrees of government intervention in order to regulate markets and firms in order to limit the loss of autonomy and reduce social inequities. Most discussion of capitalism centers on the appropriate degree of such intervention. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">These controls have been necessary because markets &amp; businesses are fueled by the pursuit of profit, are agnostic towards the social interest, and require compromising the principles of democracy, autonomy and equality. Peer production, in contrast, can serve the public interest and enable the creation of significant value, with much less surrender of democracy and loss of individual freedom. As it has evolved, peer production is powered by a commitment to the common interest, agnostic towards profit and is both supportive of, and highly dependent upon, democracy, individual freedom and social justice. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Peer production offers more, however, than mere liberation from the moral conflicts of a profit-driven world. Sadly, the mere will to &ldquo;Do Good&rdquo; does not seem sufficient in this world to motivate &ldquo;right&rdquo; conduct. If it were, charity alone would solve all problems of want and social inequity. In reality, the magnitude of our problems, the inertia of our institutions, and the relative poverty of the nonprofit realm (total charitable donations in the US equal but 2% of our GDP) are inadequate to the task. Many dedicated nonprofit leaders in consequence spend a majority of their time and energy securing donations to keep their organizations afloat, rather than devoting all of it to the causes to which they are committed. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The inherent qualities of networked peer production systems&mdash;the multiplier effect of online collaboration, the democratized production process, the growing accessibility and low barriers to entry, provide a powerful platform upon which to build transformative, value-driven enterprise. I believe that this insight is the key to understanding the emergence, and significance, of value-driven enterprise on the Internet. All things being equal, most people would prefer to do work that makes a difference. All things are rarely equal, however, in the corporate world. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><span class="style10"><strong><em>Trimtabs to the rescue:</em></strong> </span></em></strong>Futurist<strong></strong> R. Buckminster Fuller often talked about the concept of a &ldquo;trimtab&rdquo;. Large ocean liners, tankers, aircraft carriers and other massive vessels have equally massive rudders. However, even the sturdiest rudder axle would snap under the pressures of battling the inertia and water pressure resisting its attempt to change the direction of one of these behemoths. That is why, on the trailing edge of these giant rudders, there is a thin strip of steel called a trim tab. A relatively small motor turns the trim tab, which can withstand the relatively small water pressure against it. That pressure, however, is translated to the massive rudder, which responds by turning in the opposite direction, and, in turn, redirecting the entire ship. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">With what we know today about the structural dynamics of tipping points, it is easy to see how the intentional application of trimtab sensibility can hope to affect change in even the most intractable problems. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Enterprises dedicated to generating profit tend, over time, to deemphasize the intangible, hard to measure quality of &ldquo;Doing Good&rdquo; in relation to the precisely quantifiable monetary metric of &ldquo;maximizing shareholder profit&rdquo;. On the other hand, charitable enterprises committed to making a difference generally reconcile themselves to living off the scraps capitalist enterprises throw their way, constantly at the mercy of the next fundraiser to continue their vital work. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Networked peer production offers a way to make a real difference without massive financial resources, political clout or business connections. It makes things equal, and the challenge is to use it to make a difference. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Peer production has already been incorporated into profit-driven enterprises like Amazon.com (member book reviews), eBay (peer-rating of sellers) and Epinions.com, (product ratings and reviews). Clearly, commons-based peer production has a complementary role to traditional profit-driven activity. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">It is also apparent that peer-production, enabled by networks like the Internet, makes possible purely-value-driven, non-market enterprise on a scale that was previously impossible. It makes each of us a potential trimtab. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">If not for the power of networked peer-production, Michael Hart, who founded Project Gutenberg in 1971 while still a student at the University of Illinois, might still be laboring in obscurity, keying in whole books, one at a time, much as the monks of old did, transcribing manuscripts before the era of the printing press. He and his handful of helpers likely would not have made significant progress towards the goal of making a rich library of public domain books electronically available to all in his lifetime. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In fact, it took twenty years for the first 1,000 books to be entered. In the following two years, powered by networked peer production, the number of completed Project Gutenberg books doubled to 2,000. In 2001, two years after that, the number doubled to 4,000. The Distributed Proofreaders Project further utilized peer production techniques to accelerate the process beginning that year. By October 2003, the number of digitized books had topped 10,000. Project Gutenberg is now international - PG Europe was launched earlier this year. Michael Hart looks forward to the digitization of the millionth book in 2015. His projection might just be conservative. </p>

Then, we will donate all net revenue to allied, worthwhile purposes: 90% of it to nonprofit organizations working in the fields of civil society, non-violent conflict resolution, democratic empowerment, science education and critical thinking; and a critical 10% of net revenues to support the creation of other non-market open development enterprises that feature a similar, revenue-generating, further-reproducing model.</li>

                  <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style63">Introduction: </span></em></strong> <span class="style2">Traditional, specification-based standards have many virtues. The process whereby they are created is well developed and time tested, and the beneficial results that can be obtained from them are similarly established.</span></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">But while such standards can make new products possible, accelerate their market acceptance, increase consumer choices and lower costs, they are not without their weaknesses as well. Those weaknesses include the difficulty of addressing intellectual property rights (IPR) issues, the vulnerability of the standard setting system to be &ldquo;gamed&rdquo; by devious participants, and the launching of rival standards efforts for reasons of proprietary advantage rather than technical merit, among others. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"> Many of these vulnerabilities arise from the nature of this type of standard, which is well suited for creating interoperability among users. As the number of compliant products grows, so do the benefits to the owners of those products, as the &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; takes hold (e.g., the value to the owner of a telephone or a desktop computer increases with the number of users linked together on the same network).</p>

                  <p align="left" class="style2">This network effect also enables the creation of many different implementations from one point of origin, each with its own virtues of lowered cost, integration with other features and supporting services. But until a critical mass of vendors actually adopts and builds to the specification, a user is no better off using a standards-based product than any other market offering. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"> As we have pointed out in the past (see <strong><em><a href="/bulletins/feb04.php#editorial">A Look into the Future: Not &ldquo;Standards&rdquo; but &ldquo;Commonalities&rdquo;</a> </em></strong>),we believe that the traditional concept conveyed by the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; is too narrow to address the needs of a modern, networked world. While specifications serve a vital purpose, they are not optimal (and in some cases, even capable) of solving all problems. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"> Instead, we think that a better term is &ldquo;commonalities&rdquo;, a word that we believe is both broader and more conducive to thinking creatively. What distinguishes a commonality? As we have proposed before, a commonality has three essential attributes. It is: (1) whatever tool(s) we need, (2) that we need to agree on, (3) in order to do what we agree needs to be done. Depending on the goal to be achieved, traditional tools that fall within this definition include not only specifications, but also reference implementations, test suites and best practices guides. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">But with the emergence of the Internet and the Web, a new type of commonality has become possible: the end product itself, rather than the tools to create or connect products. While this new type of commonality, created through &ldquo;networked peer production&rdquo; (NPP) naturally has its own issues to address, it also has distinct virtues that avoid or address many of the problems inherent in traditional specification-based standards. This article will explore some of those differences, as well as the advantages that employing NPP methodology may offer to create new and useful commonalities. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style63"><em> Starting at the end and working back: </em></strong> An increasing number of Web-based projects are being launched that involve networks of people (often in large numbers) working to create something that is typically made available to all without charge. While the most high-profile example is Open Source software, which is made available using the GNU Public License and other variations on the same theme, there are many other projects that do not involve creating software. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">These projects are as varied as they are numerous, ranging from Project Gutenberg (which is making thousands of &ldquo;out of copyright&rdquo; books electronically available without charge), to the Creative Commons (which is creating the legal tools that permit authors to make their work product freely available on less than a full copyright basis). New efforts are being launched virtually on a daily basis.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">By starting at the end (the product itself) rather than the definition of a product or an interface (the traditional specification approach), many of the issues that arise under traditional standards are rendered moot. Consider the following: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <ul>
  <li><strong class="style63"><em> Lack of Profit Motive: </em></strong> <span class="style2"> First and foremost, when the goal is implementation without remuneration, many of the normal competitive forces that can subvert traditional standards efforts disappear. These forces include the following: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <br>
  </span>
    <ul>
<li><strong><em> <span class="style63">Subversion of Quality:</span></em></strong> <span class="style2"> In traditional standard setting, some participants have a greater incentive to adopt a particular technical approach than to achieve the best technical result. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="style63"><strong><em> Delay of Uptake: </em></strong> </span><span class="style2"> The broad adoption of standards creates losers as well as winners. Those that fear the erosion of existing proprietary advantages often work to delay the launch or thwart the success of a new standard. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="style63"><strong><em> Incentives to Launch Competing Standards:</em></strong></span><strong><em> </em></strong> <span class="style2"> While avoiding standards implementation royalties is often a goal in some industries (e.g., software), the ability to charge patent royalties is tolerated (or even expected) in others, such as the telecommunications space. Where the royalty potential is very great, a &ldquo;winner take all&rdquo; competition can result (as in the current battle over the next-generation DVD standard). In such a case, the players vie for licensing income rather than settle for the benefits of smooth and rapid market adoption of the next generation of their products. The results can be slower uptake, higher prices, and (at times) dual standards competing in the marketplace to the detriment of vendors, end-users and intermediaries alike. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="style2"> <strong class="style63"><em> IPR Issues:</em></strong> Because traditional standards efforts are intended to foster volume sales, there are incentives for participants to embed patent claims in standards, and for non-members to assert similar claims that they may own.     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="style2">None of these motivations need exist in the case of an NPP. With a single, free implementation, no participant has a reason to work against quality or immediate availability. Similarly, there is no motivation for competition (besides human nature). For example, if a second group of individuals decided that they wished to make copyright-lapsed books available on the Web, they would have no obvious motivation to input books that were already available at the Project Gutenberg site. Instead, they would be more likely to collaborate with Project Gutenberg, offering to take responsibility for a particular genre of literature, or perhaps add commentary or bibliographic material in support of the library. And (expect in the case of Open Source software) there is likely to be little potential for patent infringement, nor significant profit to be gained from a patent assertion even if infringement did exist. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                    <li class="style2"> <span class="style63"><strong><em> Independence from the Network Effect:</em></strong> </span> The output of most NPP collaborations is valuable at the moment of creation, because it is an end product. While some work product (such as Open Source software) can increase in value with broad adoption, much of this software is immediately useful even on a single platform. Other work product (such as this website or Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s output) is not only valuable and usable upon creation, but is totally independent of the efforts of third parties. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                    <li class="style2"> <span class="style63"><strong><em> Easy initiation: </em></strong> </span> The nature of the Web makes the unification of kindred spirits with public-spirited goals uniquely possible. Historically, non-profit activities were launched through one-on-one interactions. Necessarily, this limited the pool of potential supporters to those that were local, and known &ndash; a sufficient constraint to relegate many fine ideas to the status of unfulfilled visions. In contrast, Web-based NPPs can draw on a global reservoir of potentially kindred spirits. <strong></strong> In the case of Open Source, venues have already grown up (such as SourceForge) that make gathering a community of interested parties quite easy. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                    <li><span class="style63"><strong><em> Low Overhead: </em></strong> </span> <span class="style2">While historical standard setting efforts have not been large-budget affairs, they have nonetheless required the investment of time and travel expenses by those that have wished to participate, as well as the funding of the infrastructure needed to host the process, and publish and maintain the standards developed. The result is that they have been primarily commercial endeavors, with some input from academia and government but little end-user involvement. Web-based NPPs, in contrast, require almost no infrastructure at all. </span></li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <p align="left"><span class="style63"><strong><em> Where do we go from here?</em></strong></span> <span class="style2">Of course, NPP projects are not without their own limitations. Without a profit motive, there is far less market-imposed discipline, and an NPP can be as on-target, or as clueless as its members lead it to be. In the case of Linux, for example, there are a number of missing features that are of greater interest to end-users than to the volunteer engineers that have contributed to the creation of Linux to date. Similarly, NPP projects can wither as well as flourish, and are dependent upon the visionary leadership of their founders. </span></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"> But as with the consortia that burst upon the traditional standard setting scene in the late 1980s, the NPP model will evolve. We are still in the early exploratory stage of the NPP concept, and a wide variety of governance and process experiments can be expected to arise before consensus begins to emerge over what practices may best support the success of such an effort. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"> We believe that the NPP model is one of great interest, and holds profound promise across many areas of non-profit endeavor. We also believe that this methodology is uniquely suited to create useful commonalities that at times will be superior surrogates for traditional specification-based standards. In consequence, we hope that the creation of NPPs and the adoption of their work products will be embraced and supported by the standards community. </p>

              <p align="left"><span class="style2">What is it about human nature and standards, anyway? Consider two seemingly unrelated benchmarks, and the relationship of the typical American to each of these under-appreciated tools. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The first is what is referred to in common parlance as the &ldquo;calorie&rdquo; (in fact, the dietary calorie is a &ldquo;kilocalorie&rdquo;, properly so called, and is equal to 1,000 of the &ldquo;small&rdquo; calories used as a measurement in fuel research). A calorie (small or large) is an extremely precise measurement: the large, economy size, version used in dietary circles is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water, at one atmosphere of pressure (itself a precise standard), from 50 to 51 degrees Celsius. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> When it comes to thermodynamics, the human body is a machine. It converts fuel into energy, and that energy can be measured in calories. The fuel itself, therefore, can be expressed in terms of the calories of energy it can release in the process of that conversion. Similarly, the body can be analyzed in terms of the amount of energy that is required to keep it running for a given time under stated conditions. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Dieting, therefore, is a pretty simple proposition: If the energy created by the conversion of the food ingested in a day is less than the energy requirements of the body on the same day, weight loss results. Invert the relationship, and weight gain occurs instead. As Ross Perot used to say, &ldquo;Pretty simple&rdquo;. Right? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Well, you&rsquo;d never know that it was this simple today. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Not so long ago (say the 1960s), when you wanted to diet, you bought a little pamphlet that had two tables in it. In the first table, you could look up a given type of food, and find out how many calories were represented by a standard serving size. The second table told you how many calories, on average, a person of a given weight and height needed to ingest to meet 24 hours of energy demand. A deluxe version of the same type of pamphlet might also contain a third table, indicating how many calories a given type of activity (e.g., swimming or walking) might burn up. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> All you needed to lose weight was this little pamphlet, based on the humble but precise standard known as the calorie, and a measuring cup. If you wanted to go really wild, you could buy a food scale as well. Oh yes &ndash; you also needed something called &ldquo;will power&rdquo;. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The second benchmark that we&rsquo;ll examine is the S&amp;P 500 Stock Index. This familiar index aggregates the performance of a representative sample of 500 leading companies in a balanced variety of industries of importance to the U.S. economy. From time to time, companies are added and subtracted to maintain the representative nature of the mix. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The significance of the S&amp;P 500 for current purposes is that it is the index that investment professionals most often reference as the reason that potential customers should come to them to invest their savings. Only by doing so, it is usually said, can an investor provide for adequate retirement savings. Over and over again we are reminded that the 50-year average annual return of the S&amp;P is approximately 11%, and that there is not a single ten-year period in which the S&amp;P did not beat the yield of conservative bond holdings. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> So what we can learn from the above is that the only tools anyone really needs to retire in a state of svelte comfort are a simple diet table, a measuring cup, and a no-load S&amp;P index fund. Guaranteed good looks and financial security, all made possible by two simple, well-respected, well-documented standards. Who could ask for more? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Similarly, we also learn that there is no need for either diet books or other types of mutual funds, right? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Let&rsquo;s take a look and see. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Type the word &ldquo;diet&rdquo; into the &ldquo;books&rdquo; search field at Amazon.com and you&rsquo;ll get 106,154 titles to choose from (as of this writing). That&rsquo;s quite a lot of authors anxious to tell you how to read a calorie chart and wield a measuring cup. But no, calories are pass&eacute;. The offerings of today&rsquo;s diet gurus range from pure absurdity to more scientifically based diets that, at best, may make dieting marginally more effective. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> How about mutual funds? Well, at the end of 2003, there were an impressive 8,126 mutual funds available to the investor trying to beat the S&amp;P 500. In fact, the majority of these funds rarely beat the humble, mindless S&amp;P, even before taking loads and fees into account. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> So why is it that we don&rsquo;t stick to simple basics, but are always trying to beat the system? Why is it that we&rsquo;re convinced that if we try something new and different that we can eat more and still lose weight, or invest the same amount to make more? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><em> Why isn&rsquo;t predictability enough? </em></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The answer in part is that dieting and financial investments are huge industries, each of which is intent on pulling more dollars out of our pockets with new gimmickry. One day carbohydrates mean salvation; the next day they&rsquo;re damnation (while we all grow fatter by the day). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> So also with investment vehicles: junk bonds, Internet stocks and hedge funds - each gets its season in the sun, each promising a superior road to riches. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before investment professionals and authors noticed the ability of the fashion industry to drive consumers through hemline hoops like trained poodles. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In fact, the example of diets and mutual funds is symptomatic of much behavior in the commercial standards market as well, albeit for more deliberate and calculating reasons. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Standard setting is rife with competing efforts to set standards that will uniquely advantage the proponents of those standards. Witness this week&rsquo;s news that a consortium of investors led by Sony has placed the winning offer &ndash; approaching US $5 billion &ndash; to purchase the MGM film portfolio. It is believed that a leading goal behind Sony&rsquo;s bid is to gain the upper hand in a standards war. Once Sony takes control of the thousands of video titles now owned by MGM, it will be more likely that the Blu Ray next-generation DVD specification it backs will win out over the competing HD DVD specification being promoted by arch enemies NEC, Toshiba and Sanyo. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Sony lost a similar standards battle in the same market space in the late 1970s, when its proprietary Betamax video format fell victim to JVC&rsquo;s competing (and many believe inferior) VHS offering. Still smarting from that debacle, Sony appears willing to spend heavily this time around to avoid a similar defeat. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> But not only Sony suffered in the Betamax/VHS wars. Video stores and consumers took a beating as well, since stores needed to stock both formats for years, and Betamax owners ultimately were forced to abandon their expensive, and now obsolete, video players. Due to the confusion, vendors and store owners as a group made less money, consumers spent more, and the market matured more slowly. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for all if consumer electronic makers had learned a few lessons from the Betamax/VHS battle? The content owners have - they want a single standard. Which is why Sony is buying up the MGM catalog, so that it can offer that catalog (if it so chooses) only in its favored Blu Ray format, making it a safer bet for other content owners to tip in the same direction. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> So what do DVD formats have to do with diets and mutual funds? Unfortunately, it seems to be human nature not to be satisfied with the predictability that standards can offer, whether we&rsquo;re a dieter, an investor, or a consumer electronics manufacturer. Instead of playing it safe and sure, we gamble on a more problematic, and sometimes illusory greater return. </p>
              <p align="left"><span class="style2"> Too many of us are fatter as a result. And too many vendors, as well as investors, are poorer for the same reason.</span> </p>

                              <strong>eWeek, August 26, 2004 --</strong> Microsoft this month is moving forward with the developer implementation of its anti-spam Sender ID framework, but open-source advocates and mail vendors doubt whether the software giant's new proposed license meets open-source requirements. Sender ID has already gained market support. Both ISPs, such as AOL, and mail software and support companies, such as Cloudmark Inc. and Tumbleweed Communications Corp., have announced support for it. Microsoft has also announced that it will start using Sender ID for inbound e-mail to its hotmail.com, msn.com and microsoft.com domains in October. Despite this groundswell of commercial support, Microsoft's licensing requirements are incompatible with many open-source licenses, according to experts. This, in turn, means that Sender ID couldn't be implemented in open-source mail applications. ...<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1639623,00.asp">Full Story </a></p>

              <strong>TechNewsWorld.com, September 19, 2004 --</strong> The purchase of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by a group led by Sony (NYSE: SNE) will not only give the company an enormous film library but also considerable power in its fight to set the format for the next generation of digital video discs. The transition to the new discs, which are not expected to be widely available until next year at the earliest, could generate billions of dollars in royalties to the developers of the technology that runs them. Sony, as part of the Blue-ray Disc Association, a consortium of major electronics makers, is at the forefront of efforts to develop the new technological standard. As a major consumer electronics company, Sony could also reap the benefits of selling the new generation of disc players the new format would require. Sony's success in the standards battle is far from certain, though, because the rival HD DVD group, led by Toshiba and NEC (Nasdaq: NIPNY) , is championing its own format. ...<a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/news/36674.html">Full Story </a></p>

WS-Reliability is a &quot;SOAP-based specification that fulfills reliable messaging requirements critical to some applications of Web Services. It is needed because SOAP over HTTP is not sufficient when an application-level messaging protocol must also guarantee some level of reliability and security.

Furthermore, the specification was submitted in accordance with the W3C's strict intellectual property (IP) policy, turning over all copyrights to the W3C and explicitly waiving potential patent royalties and licensing fees. WS-Addressing is a critical specification for the current generation of extended WS-* specifications, since so many of them depend upon an addressing solution. WS-Addressing is also required for all but the simplest message exchange patterns (MEPs), defining a standard format for routing, reply, and error messages. MEPs such as those needed for publish/subscribe, event notification, and long running business processes need a standard for addressing. WS-Addressing provides mechanisms for specifying and correlating a message reply, and for defining a fault address. ...<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/Newcomer-WSAddressing.html">Full Story</a></p>

This means that innovators like Ericsson will turn to other technologies with greater market potential and Bluetooth, within a few years, will be confined to a few niches.

              </strong><strong>By:</strong> M.L. Baker<br>
              <strong>eWeek, August 20, 2004 -- </strong> At a panel discussion on the last day of the IEEE-sponsored Computational Systems Biology Conference at Stanford University, researchers concluded that the standards-making process is painful and arduous, but many clearly felt that a standards project could foster efficiency and perhaps even reverse the rapid fragmentation of life sciences. Part of the purpose of the meeting was to gauge whether the relatively new field was ready for standards. Standards are already being developed, in an ad hoc fashion, within various pockets of the life sciences community. There is already considerable overlap in standards being codified by societies such as W3C, IUPAC, and I3C; part of the committee's job will be to figure out what all the other groups are doing. The issues are sometimes as fundamental as developing a common language, according to Sylvia Spengler. For example, the same protein or gene could have different names in different communities, such as those that think about pathways, gene products, gene expression or gene sequences. ...<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1638370,00.asp">Full Story

Or a hotel that can detect when a room is vacant, and turn off the heating or cooling systems in that room to save energy. Later this year, vendors will start releasing products based on a wireless standard called Zigbee that enable these types of sensor networks. The Zigbee Alliance plans to certify products with a Zigbee logo to ensure that products from different vendors are interoperable and easy to manage, said Bob Heile, chairman of the Zigbee Alliance, at a briefing for reporters and analysts at the Zigbee Alliance Member Meeting in Boston Wednesday. ...<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/08/18/HNzigbee_1.html?STANDARDS">Full Story </a></p>

Under the initiative, Nokia Corp. and Vodafone Group PLC hope to drive the development of specifications for an open standards-based mobile Java services architecture. The group intends to establish a number of new component Java Specification Requests and clarifications to existing specifications in a move to define a consistent Java API services architecture, according to the companies. This unified services architecture, they said, will enable Java-based applications to run on mobile devices from multiple vendors. The objectives and responsibilities of the unified mobile Java services architecture will be aligned and coordinated with several organizations, such as the OSGIi Alliance, the Open Mobile Alliance, the Open Mobile Terminal Platform and the World Wide Web Consortium. ..<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/08/26/HNmobilejava_1.html">.Full Story

              <strong>CNET News.com, August 18, 2004 --</strong> The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has handed Microsoft a second victory in its dispute with Eolas, rejecting browser patent claims that could roil the Web if upheld. The patent in question, owned by the University of California and licensed exclusively to its Eolas software spinoff, describes the way a Web browser opens third-party applications, or &quot;plug-ins,&quot; within the browser. The decision is a big victory for the software giant and another setback for Eolas, which claimed the rights to the way browsers open third-party applications. Eolas has at least one more opportunity to argue its case. Patents and copyrights have been taking on a higher profile in the software industry in recent months. The issue is especially contentious in the open-source arena, where the Linux operating system has become embroiled in a number of intellectual-property disputes. ...<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5315367.html">Full Story

Lucia said one technical solution under consideration is the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), a nonproprietary data interchange format that can simultaneously transmit emergency alerts through different communication networks.

              </strong><strong>PRNewswire, Las Vegas,, August 26, 2004 / --</strong> The Gaming Standards Association (GSA) has announced a new policy that would allow non-GSA members to license GSA's groundbreaking standards. The policy takes effect immediately and opens the door for virtually instant, global adoption of GSA's protocol standards. The policy applies to all GSA standards, including the Best of Breed (BOB) and the System-to-System (S2S) standards. Previously, GSA's standards were available to all members, including supporting members. The new policy allows non-member companies to license any or all of GSA's standards. GSA Board President Gregg Solomon said, &quot;This is a landmark decision in the history of the gaming industry. What this means is, starting right now, companies around the world can license and begin implementing protocol standards immediately. That is to say, the entire industry has now moved on past the old days of expending resources and development on company-specific protocols to a new era, where creativity in product development can flourish, moved forward by global standards.&quot;
