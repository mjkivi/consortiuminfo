			<h3>On the Road to Geneva</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>Two and a half years ago, some of us learned a new three letter combination: "ODF." Today, tens of millions of people are familiar with that acronym, as well as another: "OOXML."  The former is short hand for the OpenDocument Format, an OASIS developed and ISO/IEC JTC1 unanimously adopted standard that enables documents created in one compliant software package to be easily exchanged with another.  A variety of proprietary and open source products, both traditional and Web-based, support ODF.</p>
			<p>OOXML stands for "Office Open XML," a specification that describes the XML-based structure of Microsoft's Office 2007 suite.  OOXML was adopted by Ecma last year and then also offered up to ISO/IEC JTC1, where it has had a stormy ride.  Last year, OOXML failed to garner the necessary votes to gain approval at the end of a "Fast Track" review period, accumulating 3,522 comments along the way.  OOXML is implemented in Office 2007, and to a greater or lesser degree is being incorporated into other products, primarily for the purpose of interoperating with Office.</p>
			<p>On February 25, dispositions proposed by Ecma to those comments will be reviewed by National Body representatives in Geneva, Switzerland, and on March 29, the final fate of OOXML in JTC1 will be determined, although not the outcome of the commercial battle that will continue to rage in the marketplace between Microsoft, on the one hand, and industry giants such as IBM, Sun, and Google, on the other.  The continuing adoption of ODF has also become a <em>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</em> among proponents of open standards, open source software, and (how to say delicately?) those that do not have great affection for Microsoft.</p>
			<p>I first wrote in detail about ODF in September of 2005 when I dedicated an issue of this eJournal to that topic, calling it <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php">Massachusetts and OpenDocument: the Commonwealth Shows the Way</a>. As the title indicates, I believe that "open document formats" are vitally important, and in the months thereafter, I have dedicated more than <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/index.php?topic=20051116124417686">100 blog entries</a> to reporting on this story as it continued to evolve.</p>
			<p>Why do open documents matter?  Quite simply, because our continuing ability to access the documents will determine whether the future will have access to the past &mdash; a real concern as we become more beguiled by the advantages that new technologies offer, without paying adequate attention to what we sacrifice when we transition away from the less nimble and compressible, but far more stable and durable storage media of the past.  For an illustration of this tradeoff, you may wish to read the <em>Consider This</em> piece from that past issue.  It's titled <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#considerthis">Clay Tablets, iPods, and Evo/Devolution</a>, and makes for a light, but still sobering read.</p>
			<p>Which brings us to this new issue on open document formats.  In it, I attempt to present the ODF &mdash; OOXML sage in a variety of perspectives, beginning with the <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>, which notes that the traditional standards adoption process has been overwhelmed by the effort to "Fast Track" a 6,000 page specification, which garnered 3,522 comments and a 2,300 page comment disposition document, and a storm of contentious lobbying and debate as well.  My editorial calls for an overhaul of that process, if it is to remain relevant and useful to the IT industry.  It also calls for greater transparency in a process that affects us all.</p>
			<p>My <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong> seeks to dive beneath the ODF-OOXML conflict in order to explore the wider technical, competitive and political context in which this standards war is being waged.  In doing so, I suggest that while bitter, this competition is but a skirmish in a more systemic reordering of the influence and market position of the Great Powers of information technology.</p>
			<p>As you may have guessed from the above, the shooting war between the advocates of ODF and OOXML makes for quite a story.  Not only is the story line itself intriguing, but the ongoing events illustrate how new technologies and the great companies that rely upon them rise, fall, compete and evolve, profoundly affecting our lives along the way.  Many journalists agree, and coverage continues to widen around the world.</p>
			<p>Needless to say, it has captured my interest as well.  In the course of reporting this saga, I have interviewed many of those most closely involved, as well as read thousands of articles and many primary resources.  The result is a new writing project that I launched at the end of November &mdash; an eBook in process, with the working title of <em>ODF vs. OOXML: War of the Words</em>. I've posted five chapters at my blog to date, and will continue to add new ones every week or two.  The first chapter is included as this issue's excerpt from <strong><em>The Standards Blog</em></strong>.</p>
			<p>The <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> essay for this issue explores a different theme, which is the mysterious ways in which the most successful Web projects draw people from all over the world.  Google has launched yet another one of its on line project trials in (thus far private) Beta form, offering knowledge experts the opportunity to experiment with different models of on-line collaboration.  It will be interesting to see what may evolve from this intriguing beginning.</p>
			<p>Finally, I'm pleased to share the latest site redesign launch at ConsortiumInfo.org. Yesterday, we pushed the new pages live at the <strong><em>Standards MetaLibrary</em></strong>, bringing the same clean new look and feel of Standards Today to this unique Web-based research resource.  If you've never visited the MetaLibrary before, take a moment now to become familiar with it.  And if you know of worthwhile work that is not already included in the over 1,000 articles available through the MetaLibrary, please let me know.</p>
			<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this issue.</p>

			<h4>EDITORIAL:</h4>
			<h3>The Overwhelming of ISO/IEC JTC1</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>On February 25 the doors of a conference room in Geneva, Switzerland will swing open to admit 120 standards professionals from 40 nations around the world.  The unenviable goal of these chosen few over the ensuing five days will be to reconcile the technical comments that have been tendered in relation to a single specification proposed for adoption by ISO/IEC JTC1.  I say unenviable, because what happens behind those doors after they close will more likely resemble a contentious debate in the General Assembly of the United Nations than the purely technical deliberations of a standards committee.</p>
			<p>The reason, of course, is that this is no ordinary specification, but DIS 29500 (a/ka/ Ecma 376 Office Open XML, and more commonly referred to as simply "OOXML").  Few would disagree that OOXML has garnered more vendor attention, attracted more efforts (both pro and con) in more countries around the globe, and earned more publicity than any other IT specification in recent memory.  Quite simply, it is the standard of the decade &mdash; at least if conflict is the metric.</p>
			<p>Last year, OOXML failed to achieve the necessary support to progress directly to final approval.  Along the way, it accumulated 3,522 comments, and the purpose of the Ballot Resolution Meeting (BRM) that will commence on February 25 will be to attempt to resolve a sufficient number of those comments to the satisfaction of the relevant JTC1 members to allow OOXML to be finally approved.  That determination will be made in the thirty days following the close of the BRM on February 29.</p>
			<p>Alex Brown, the designated Convenor of the BRM, is likely to face a daunting challenge in managing the process, due to the level of emotion that has surrounded the consideration of OOXML to date, the shear volume of comments that must be addressed, and, finally, the overwhelming length &mdash; 2,300 pages &mdash; of the formal Proposed Disposition of Comments document that was released on January 14th to the National Bodies (but not the public), and which will function as the basis for discussion.</p>
			<p>While the proposed dispositions have been released in batches beginning in December, someone just commencing the chore of wading through them on January 14th would need to understand, evaluate and form an opinion on over a hundred comments, and more than half that many pages, every day of the week between now and February 25th.  Given that each comment disposition previously released was packaged in its own, separate PDF file, and posted to a Web site in batches of 500 or more at a time, that is presumably what many delegates will in fact need to do.  More than ironically, OOXML was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC1 under its "Fast Track" process, although the specification itself was over 6,000 pages in length.</p>
			<p>Given the technical complexity of both the comments submitted as well as the dispositions proposed by Ecma, BRM attendees will be severely tested by the challenge of fully reviewing the resolutions proposed by Ecma in the dispositions document and considering what helpful alternatives they might offer in their stead.  Certainly the time available will offer little opportunity for attendees to talk in advance among themselves.</p>
			<p>Of equal concern is the fact that only one week will be available for the BRM to complete its work, with no provision for an extension.  Whatever is completed to the satisfaction of the attendees by the end of the week &mdash; and as significantly, what is not &mdash; will obviously have an impact on the final outcome.  Happily, many of the comments that must be addressed are not likely to be contentious, and Alex Brown anticipates that the resolutions to these comments will be approved quickly, and in batches.  Whether or not all of the remainder can be discussed to the satisfaction of those in attendance, however, remains to be seen.</p>
			<p>Achieving that result will be Brown's goal, and last year he launched a <a href="http://www.adjb.net/index.php">blog</a> at which he has regularly shared his plans for managing the BRM, displaying both a sense of humor as well as a commendable determination to conduct the meeting in a no-nonsense fashion.  If he can maintain both order as well as his composure (let alone his sense of humor) through to the conclusion of the process, he will have performed well indeed.</p>
			<p>But what will the outcome of the BRM be, and how well will it reflect on the process that will conclude at the end of March?  Here are a few observations to consider in formulating an answer to that question:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Many members of SC 34, the committee that considered OOXML last year, complained that they had too little time to properly review OOXML, due to its unprecedented length.<br /><br /></li>
				<li>It has been universally acknowledged &mdash; including by some at Microsoft &mdash; that OOXML was in need of serious improvement at the time it was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC1, even though it had been processed and approved by Ecma for that purpose.<br /><br /></li>
				<li>Due to the 6,000 page length of OOXML, not all problems are likely to have been identified during the formal review period.  But any deficiencies in OOXML discovered after September 2, according to the JTC1 Directives <a href="http://www.adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry080107-183411">as cited by Brown</a>, are "out of scope," and may not be addressed at the BRM.  Instead, they must await resolution in the next review cycle (i.e., years in the future).<br /><br /></li>
				<li>The only complete office suite implementation of OOXML to date is Microsoft Office 2007, which has already shipped.  If OOXML is approved, it remains to be seen whether, and if so when, it will be implemented in its final form by Microsoft, and if so, how many of its customers will install the service packs or other updates that would bring their software into compliance.  Any discussion of these issues will also be "out of scope" at the BRM, which is intended to address purely technical issues, and there is no other venue at which such issues can be discussed and addressed.  As a result, the main goal used to justify the adoption of a second format standard for editable documents may not be achieved &mdash; assuring access to documents already created in Office by means of an open standard &mdash; in the future.  Moreover, in early January it became known that Microsoft had issued a service pack in September to Office 2003 customers that deliberately disabled their ability to access documents originally created in some earlier versions of Office, undercutting the rationale for adopting a second revisable open format document standard at all.<br /><br /></li>
				<li>It does not appear at this time as if the resolutions proposed by Ecma will be made available at a public Web site before the BRM, if ever.  Consequently, the 500 million users of Office and the legions of independent software vendors whose software must be used in conjunction with Office will have no opportunity to convey their opinions to the delegates that will nominally represent their interests at the BRM.<br /><br /></li>
				<li>The final vote on OOXML will follow the conclusion of the BRM, whether or not all comment resolutions have been resolved.  It appears that if the vote is in favor of adoption, unresolved comments will not be dealt with, if ever, until the next review cycle.<br /><br /></li>
				<li>No outsiders will be allowed to attend the BRM, nor will any transcript be prepared and made available.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Brown points out at his blog that much of this is in compliance with the JTC1 Directives, and that the rest is at least not in violation of those rules.</p>
			<p>Because a proceeding is in compliance with an established process does not, of course, guarantee a good outcome, especially where the process has changed little while much else has evolved in dramatic fashion.   Pushing a specification through Ecma and ISO/IEC JTC1 at maximum speed serves to illustrate the shortcomings of a process that is at minimum not up to the challenge of performing in so highly charged a competitive setting, nor appropriate for a specification of such great length.  It also calls into question whether a quasi-governmental process involving national representation and the adoption of standards with universal impact has any business being so non-transparent, whatever the historical rationale for such secretive practices may have been.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the progress of OOXML through the ISO/IEC JTC1 process has been rife with accounts of undue vendor pressure, and in some cases, improper vendor conduct, that in most cases appears not to be covered by any rules at all.  The wide publicity that this conduct has rightly been given hardly reflects well on a system that allows such conduct to occur without consequences, nor does it help to inspire public faith in the integrity of that process, or its deliverables.</p>
			<p>The result is that if OOXML is finally approved, it may not be of the quality that the imprimatur of the ISO/IEC is presumed to indicate, given the limited amount of time available for the BRM, the insufficient time allowed to non-National Body stakeholders to review the proposed dispositions, in advance, or to offer useful comments of their own, and the fact that not all deficiencies may be eligible for discussion at the BRM.  At the same time, if OOXML is not approved, it will provide scant vindication for the process, due to the great deal of effort and energy expended by a very large number of people to no useful purpose.  If OOXML was destined to garner 3,522 comments, why did Ecma allow it to progress to ISO/IEC JTC1 at all?  More importantly, what steps will be taken to ensure that a similarly lengthy and flawed specification is not "fast tracked" again?</p>
			<p>Moreover, assuming that Microsoft is right in its opinion that the world would be a better place with OOXML as a <em>de jure</em> standard, then all concerned would have been better served &mdash; including Microsoft &mdash; had the rules required Ecma to do a more thorough job, and then allowed ISO/IEC JTC1 to proceed at a pace more suited to the length and  complexity of the OOXML specification.</p>
			<p>Perhaps most troubling is the fact that a global system that purports to represent the interests of "all stakeholders" and reserves the right to itself to define the minimum attributes of the processes that create "open standards" can operate with so little visibility and accountability to those same stakeholders.</p>
			<p>Whatever the ultimate fate of DIS 29500 may be, the very public progress of OOXML in ISO /IEC JTC1 from beginning to end has revealed a process that is in need of serious review and revision.  Hopefully that task will be undertaken soon, and performed thoroughly and well, if the traditional standards process is to remain relevant and useful to a modern world.</p>

			<h3>ODF vs. OOXML: War of the Words<br />(an eBook in Process)</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<h6>Date: November 25, 2007<br /><span class="views">Views: 5, 661</span></h6>
			<!-- <img class="imgright" src="/images/odf.gif" alt="" width="50" height="50" border="0" /> -->
			<p>For some time I've been considering writing a book about what has become a standards war of truly epic proportions. I refer, of course, to the ongoing, ever expanding, still escalating conflict between ODF and OOXML, a battle that is playing out across five continents and in both the halls of government and the marketplace alike. And, needless to say, at countless blogs and news sites all the Web over as well.</p>
			<p>Arrayed on one side or the other, either in the forefront of battle or behind the scenes, are most of the major IT vendors of our time. And at the center of the conflict is Microsoft, the most successful software vendor of all time, faced with the first significant challenge ever to one of its core businesses and profit centers &mdash; its flagship Office productivity suite.</p>
			<p>The story has other notable features as well: ODF is the first IT standard to be taken up as a popular cause, and also represents the first "cross over" standards issue that has attracted the broad support of the open source community. Then there are the societal dimensions: open formats are needed to safeguard our culture and our history from oblivion. And when implemented in open source software and deployed on Linux-based systems (not to mention One Laptop Per Child computers), the benefits and opportunities of IT become more available to those throughout the third world.</p>
			<p>There is little question, I think, that regardless of where and how this saga ends, it will be studied in business schools and by economists for decades to come. What they will conclude will depend in part upon the materials we leave behind for them to examine. That's one of the reasons I'm launching this effort now, as a publicly posted eBook in progress, rather than waiting until some indefinite point in the future when the players in this drama have been colored by the passage of time and the influence of later events.</p>
			<p>My hope is that those of you who have played or are now playing a part in the ODF vs. OOXML story will supplement or correct what I'm writing by sharing your facts and insights, either by posting your comments publicly at this blog, or by contacting me privately me via email. My goal will be to present what happened as completely, accurately and readably as I can, so I hope that those on both sides of the fence will work with me. In all cases, I will try and fairly incorporate what you offer into the whole.</p>
			<p>My second goal is to help those that have come to this story late in the day &mdash; halfway through the movie, as it were &mdash; learn what happened prior to when you entered the theater. That way, you'll be better able to put current events into context as they happen, understand the cast of characters more fully as they continue to play their parts, and above all, appreciate the nuances of the still unfolding plot.</p>
			<p>So without further ado, here is the first chapter of a book whose total length will be determined by events yet to unfold, whose ultimate print publisher is yet to be found, and which for now bears the working title of "War of the Words."</p>
			<p><strong>Chapter 1: Out of Nowhere</strong></p>
			<p>On September 1, 2005, a New York-based writer for the London <em>Financial Times</em> named Richard Waters wrote a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/80033a76-1a71-11da-b7f5-00000e2511c8.html">brief article</a>, posting it to the Web via FT.com's San Francisco office. The seemingly unremarkable subject of the piece was the release of a new draft of a procurement guideline by the Information Technology Division (ITD) of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' procurement of new technology.  Some of the datapoints in the article were wide of the mark (he referred to Massachusetts as "one of the most populous states in the US" for example), but this was fitting for a story that would circle the world for years to come, as often as not unencumbered by facts inconsistent with the spin <em>du jour</em>.</p>
			<p>What elevated the story from a space filler in the business section to a hot property was the news that the ITD planned to banish Microsoft's Office software suite from 50,000 government computers.  If the ITD had its way, 28 Executive Agencies would no longer use Word to create documents, Excel to plot spreadsheets, or PowerPoint to craft presentations.  Instead, government employees would be required to use software that saved documents in "open formats" &mdash; which Office did not, according to the ITD's definition.  Moreover, Microsoft claimed that it had been taken by surprise by the decision (a claim the ITD later denied); Waters rubbed salt in the wound by describing the event as "one of the most significant setbacks" for Microsoft in the US market.</p>
			<p>Only the FT.com site carried the story at first.  But word of the defection of this large Microsoft customer spread quickly via the Internet, in large part because of the abundance of blogs and amateur news sites that focus on technology stories, but also because so many of the people who write for and visit these sites are hostile to Microsoft.  Soon, visitors with strange on-line aliases like <em>SpaceLifeForm, Sammy the Snake</em> and <em>Cybervegan</em> were posting gleeful comments at the expense of the software vendor, and trying to learn more about what "open formats" might be, and why they were so important.</p>
			<p>The decision makers in Massachusetts were Peter Quinn, the state's Chief Information Officer (CIO), and his boss, Secretary of Administration and Finance Eric Kriss.  There were good reasons why they wanted to convert to software capable of saving documents using open formats. One was so that citizens could exchange documents with the State no matter what software they chose to use.  As things currently stood, someone in Massachusetts would need to invest in a copy of Office before it could download a document electronically from a state government site.</p>
			<p>But an even more important motivation arose from the fact that Massachusetts, like governments everywhere, was rapidly moving towards a future where public records in paper form would cease to exist.  Soon, government archives would exclusively comprise documents in electronic form, stored in vast banks of servers or on magnetic media.  After thousands of years, traditional hard copy documents were destined to follow the path earlier taken by musical recordings, which in the course of a hundred years had already passed from wax, to vinyl, to tape, to optical disk media, eventually to slip the surly bonds of discrete physical storage media entirely and be reborn as electronic files.  These files were recorded in formats of their own, with interesting names like <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg Vorbis</a>, or more prosaic ones, like <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">MP3</a> (both open formats), as well as the proprietary formats that Apple uses to create its popular iTunes.</p>
			<p>Each time one of these new storage formats (physical and then virtual) had came along, the old one became obsolete.  Within a matter of years, new music couldn't be purchased in the old format at all.  Anyone that wanted to upgrade their equipment while preserving their existing investment in the old format needed to keep their old player in good repair, or else laboriously transfer their old albums, song by song, to the new format, losing fidelity in the process.   Once word processors, each using a proprietary format (Word, WordPerfect and so on), replaced typewriters governments, businesses and individuals faced a repeat of the same experience.  Most had already faced at least one such conversion, typically moving from WordPerfect to Microsoft's Office, after the latter product became dominant in the marketplace.</p>
			<p>Governments that now wished to digitize the millions of hard copy documents lying in their archives faced a far greater challenge due to the sheer size of the task.  And they also felt a greater responsibility as well.  Simply put, Massachusetts wanted to be sure that in five, ten or a hundred years it would be able to access those digitized documents using whatever equipment was then available, rather than having to dust off the equivalent of an eight track tape player &mdash; if it could find one.</p>
			<p>Waters may have used a bit of hyperbole to inflate the commercial importance of Massachusetts in his Financial Times article, but his calibration of the threat that the Massachusetts decision presented to Microsoft was right on the money.  Indeed, Microsoft was already deploying its considerable resources to take all actions necessary to bring about a reversal of the ITD's decision, if at all possible, and to blunt the market impact of the decision otherwise.</p>
			<p>The reason lay not so much in the potential loss of revenue from this large customer, but in the dramatic increase in credibility that the announcement gave to the importance of open formats.  Microsoft owned more than 90% of the global marketplace for office suite software, and had worked long and hard to achieve that enviable position.  Some 400 million customers used Office, and it wasn't likely that Microsoft would lose them, so long as software utilized "closed" formats controlled by individual vendors.  While that state of affairs continued, most customers would remain trapped by the billions of documents they had already created.  Opening, converting and resaving those documents using the software of any other vendor would be difficult, time consuming and expensive.  In the words of economists, these customers were safely "locked in."</p>
			<p>But now an open format standard was available that promised to liberate users from lock in to Office for life.  And a high-profile customer had announced that it was leaving the pack to adopt it.  For the first time, there was a breach in Microsoft's outer defenses.  In response, the vendor was marshalling all of the forces at its disposal to contain the threat before it could spread.</p>

			<h3><span class="red">#52</span> How to Challenge a Virtual Brontosaurus</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>The World Wide Web has now left its first decade of existence well behind it, with the result that untold thousands of stabs in the virtual dark have been attempted.  Most failed after consuming billions of dollars of venture capital.  Out of those wildly disparate ventures (remember pet food on the Internet?), only a surprisingly small number of business models, social sites, and the like found traction, each emulated to a greater or lesser extent by countless imitators.  In most cases, only one or a few of ultimately rose to the top.</p>
			<p>Indeed, during these heady times it seemed the highly evolved ecosystem of bricks and mortar commerce and human society had been annihilated by a technological meteor, opening up endless niches that could be populated by new, nimble on-line ventures and social spaces, each engaged in a frantic, Darwinian struggle rivaling the real-world competition that followed the Pre-Cambrian Extinction.</p>
			<p>In due and rapid course, this fast-forwarding evolutionary process determined the virtual phyla that would be the survivors in the post-impact world &mdash; a process accelerated by a sudden, adverse economic change that ensured that only the very fittest would survive.  After that shakeout, the New World order had been established, with some species very much at the top of the food chain:  on line auctions (eBay) proved to be Boffo at the Internet boxoffice, as were book sellers (Amazon &mdash; after a prodigious outflow of investor dollars).  So also cut-rate stock brokers (eTrade), illegal wagering (R.I.P. &mdash; not every species that flourishes at first sustains when the environment changes), and, of course, that modern-day Tyrannosaurus Rex of the Web &mdash; Search (Google).</p>
			<p>Vegetarians, of course, also rebounded.  Community sites sprang up like toad stools, large (Craigslist &mdash; slightly carniverous, actually) and small (countless open source projects, many flourishing at Sourceforge &mdash; the virtual world has islands with their own unique ecosystems, allowing species to flourish locally).  With time, there also evolved a mighty Brontosaurus (a/k/a the Wikipedia), which flourishes, in various sizes, throughout the world and continues to extend its range.</p>
			<p>Today it seems that all of the available niches are full, or nearly so, with each niche characteristically dominated by one Alpha species.  Only at greater and greater intervals is a new phylum of Web-based potential discovered (when, after all, did the last YouTube explode?)</p>
			<p>As a result, the glorious days of opportunity are largely ended &mdash; at least until the next technology-based meteor strikes.</p>
			<p>Or so it would seem, until we take another evolutionary force into account: symbiosis, conjoined with a bit of incubation, perhaps, to protect the new species from the brutal realities of the real world until it has gained some strength.  With a little help from an already dominant species, there may still be a way for a new contender species to grow and challenge the Internet incumbents after all.</p>
			<p>Google, it appears, thinks that this may be the case, and it's willing to find out by challenging the Brontosaurus.</p>
			<p>It all began with an inconspicuous <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html">announcement</a> posted at the Google Web site on December 13, 2007, in which Google revealed that it was launching a non-public Beta of its own collaborative on-line encyclopedia project.  The project would not, however, be simply a clone of the Wikipedia: significant differences would include single-author control for each entry, freedom for other authors to set up competing pages, bylines for page authors, reader ranking, and &mdash; oh yes &mdash; Google ads.  That's where the symbiosis comes in: authors that wish to permit ads to be displayed at their Knols (GoogleSpeak for "a unit of knowledge") will be entitled to receive a "substantial" share of the resulting revenues.</p>
			<p>Here's how Google introduced the concept:</p>
			<blockquote>The web contains an enormous amount of information, and Google has helped to make that information more easily accessible by providing pretty good search facilities. But not everything is written nor is everything well organized to make it easily discoverable. There are millions of people who possess useful knowledge that they would love to share, and there are billions of people who can benefit from it. We believe that many do not share that knowledge today simply because it is not easy enough to do that. The challenge posed to us by Larry, Sergey and Eric was to find a way to help people share their knowledge. This is our main goal.</blockquote>
			<p>The question is how successfully the Knol project will compete with the Wikipedia, both in attracting author input as well as readers.</p>
			<p>And, of course, how it will compete in quality, a concern that Google may share, given that it has decided to incubate its fledgling competitor out of sight for now.  According to an article published in the  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/technology/15web.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin">New York Times</a> two days after the Google announcement, it is possible that the Knol project may never leave the nest, if early results are not encouraging.  During the first phase, page authors will be admitted by invitation only &mdash; a smart move, as it will not only get the project off to a high quality start, but will also appeal to the egos of other authors that want to join an at least initially exclusive club.</p>
			<p>That said, the sample Knol included in the announcement struck me as being rather intimidating for potential authors &mdash; and perhaps deliberately so, to discourage people from setting up anything less than a print encyclopedia style and quality entry.  Whether Google has aimed too high in doing so will remain to be seen.  That said, Google's announcement says that it will not exercise any editorial control over individual topic entries, and, as a result, "we cannot expect that all of them will be of high quality."</p>
			<p>Google describes the roll out as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>Earlier this week, we started inviting a selected group of people to try a new, free tool that we are calling "knol"&hellip;. Our goal is to encourage people who know a particular subject to write an authoritative article about it. The tool is still in development and this is just the first phase of testing. For now, using it is by invitation only. But we wanted to share with everyone the basic premises and goals behind this project.</blockquote>
			<p>The less rigid approach adopted by Google for the project is what I find to be most intriguing.  In effect, the Knol platform resembles like Sourceforge more than the Wikipedia, since the tools provided will allow different, variously open cultures to evolve under specific topics, with some authors insisting on maintaining total control of their topic, and others acting as project managers, guiding the process in a manner more like an open source project.  In short, the Knol project will be another island where new evolutionary experiments can play out.  Here's how Google described this freedom:</p>
			<blockquote>Knols will include strong community tools. People will be able to submit comments, questions, edits, additional content, and so on.  Anyone will be able to rate a knol or write a review of it. Knols will also include references and links to additional information.  At the discretion of the author, a knol may include ads.  If an author chooses to include ads, Google will provide the author with substantial revenue share from the proceeds of those ads.</blockquote>
			<p>Not only different models of collaboration would be possible, but different types of presentations and areas of focus, making the Knol a less uniform, but more interesting browse, at least in its pioneer phase; over time, a more uniform approach might organically evolve.  Or, who knows, perhaps not &mdash; perhaps the island of the Knol might become more like a library than an encyclopedia, which could be very exciting indeed.</p>
			<p>Assuminig that the Knol project is releasef from the incubator and the public is invited to participate, it will be quite interesting to see which pages become most popular when there are duplicates &mdash; the page written by (for example) a college professor including exclusively her own content, or a competing page constructed and constantly updated through a more Wikipedian process?  The strictly objective essay, or the edgy, screenshot reflection of the sensibilities of the moment?</p>
			<p>All that aside, the question remains: if Google gives a Knol, will authors in fact come?</p>
			<p>Notwithstanding its huge success, it's worth noting that a comparatively small number of people out of the more than a billion potential authors with Internet access actually contribute the great majority of the Wikipedia's content.  Still, it has been able to achieve an enormous breadth of articles, each striving for an objective presentation, based upon available third party material.  Google evidently hopes that it's model will appeal to enough subject matter experts to compete, thereby populating an encyclopedia with thousands of entries.</p>
			<p>Will that happen?  In fact, I'm rather doubtful.  The success of community-based projects has to date seemingly relied on a delicate, and thus far only partially understood set of dynamics.  The factors involved include the power of viral information distribution, the appeal of psychic as compared to monetary rewards, on-line social mores, and equal opportunity balanced with merit-based authority.  The Google plan is sufficiently different in many of these areas that its attraction therefore remains to be demonstrated.</p>
			<p>The final way in which the project appeals to me from an experimental point of view is that it represents a potential solution for one of the more intractible issues that the evolution of the Web to date has posed.  On the one hand, the Web gives anyone the potential to display their works of authorship and attract readers.  On the other hand, it has hugely impacted the ability of writers to make a living from their craft, due to the explosion of high quality, interesting, and diverse content at a multiplicity of sites.  Perhaps Google's willingness to share ad revenue to a more significant extent than in the past may provide sufficient life support to save at least one pre-Internet meteor species from the very brink of extinction.</p>
			<p>Or, at least, so I hope.  My day job is getting in the way of my writing.</p>

			<h4>NEW AT CONSORTIUMINFO.ORG:</h4>
			<h3>A New Look for the Standards MetaLibrary</h3>
			<blockquote><em>Metalibrary: An (abstract) metalibrary is the entire collection of a society's data, information, and techniques, together with the means by which it is stored, accessed, and communicated. (Rick Sutcliffe, The Fourth Civilization, 1998)</em></blockquote>
			<p>In February of 2005, I launched a new resource at ConsortiumInfo.org called the "<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/metalibrary/">Standards Metalibrary</a>." The announcement of the MetaLibrary was included in an issue I dedicated to <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb05.php#announcing">The Study of Standards</a>, which emphasized the increasing importance of standards of all types to modern society. Briefly stated, the purpose of the MetaLibrary was to aggregate the largest collection anywhere of serious works of authorship on standards for the benefit of students, academics, standards professionals and government. As with everything else at ConsortiumInfo.org, the MetaLibrary is available free of charge as a service to my firm's many consortium and corporate clients, as well as for the standards community at large.</p>
			<p>As with everything else at ConsortiumInfo.org, the MetaLibrary is available free of charge for the benefit of my firm's many consortium and other standards clients, as well as for the standards community at large.  the mission of the MetaLibrary was more fully explained in the original <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb05.php#announcing">announcement</a>, which read in part as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>What is the Standards MetaLibrary? Just as "meta information" is "information about information" and not useful data in its own right, and "metatags" are hidden codes that help a browser find a specific webpage, a "metalibrary" is a means to an end, and not the end in itself. In this case, the MetaLibrary is a research tool comprising an ever-increasing number of carefully indexed, sortable and searchable abstracts (1,086, as of this writing) of articles about standards. Each abstract is linked to the full text of the article at its host site.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>The Standards MetaLibrary is not limited to material about standards in a narrow sense. Rather, it focuses on the importance of standards to the modern world and their impact on society, and how they are created, and by whom. The materials included therefore address topics such as how the standard setting process operates, how governments support this process and utilize standards, the economic benefits of standards uptake, legal aspects of the use (and abuse) of standards, and many other subjects that illustrate the role of standards in the world today.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Why is there a need for a Standards MetaLibrary? There are four principal reasons why we have created, and why Sun Microsystems has supported (Sun provided a generous development grant to the project in 2004), the Standards MetaLibrary:</blockquote>
			<ol>
				  <li>To raise the consciousness of society in general, and government in particular, on the importance of standards to society. With the increasing interdependence of the world on the Internet and the Web, the standards that enable communications and information technology are becoming essential to the operation of almost all aspects of modern life. The Standards MetaLibrary will provide a ready, effective and encyclopedic reference for those creating policy and supporting the legislative process.<br /><br /></li>
				  <li>To encourage the proliferation of serious works of scholarship on standards and standard setting. By providing greater exposure for existing work, greater ease for conducting further research, and a broader audience for new work, we hope to provide incentives for more authors to dedicate their efforts to works of scholarship in this area of study.<br /><br /></li>
				  <li>By making a rich and growing body of work readily available (most of which has been made available by the copyright holders without cost), we hope to encourage colleges and universities to offer more courses on standards, and to include more readings on standards in the syllabi of courses on other subjects as well.<br /><br /></li>
				  <li>As the number of pages available on the Web expands more rapidly than the ability of search engines to efficiently filter them, the need for specialized on-line research resources becomes more acute. For example, a search using the relatively narrow request "consortium +standard +technical +internet +society" on the new Google Scholar web browser returned 8,110 items on February 12, 2005. With such riches at hand, how can someone performing research reliably find her way to the particular information needed?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Needless to say, standards are even more important now than they were two years ago.  To give but a few examples, knowledge is becoming increasingly digitized, the world is becoming ever more networked, and confronting global warming will be very dependent upon the development of adequate standards to assess and restrict further damage.</p>
			<p>Now, the MetaLibrary has a new look and feel, carrying over the cleaner, more intuitive style and organization of Standards Today (throughout this year, the rest of the ConsortiumInfo.org site will be similarly updated).  In addition, I have launched an aggressive program of adding new material to the MetaLibrary on a weekly basis (you can follow the additions as they are made by using the RSS feed that you can find <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/metalibrary/rss.php">here</a>).</p>
			<p>Whether or not you are familiar with the MetaLibrary, take a moment to <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/metalibrary/">check it out</a> at http://www.consortiuminfo.org/metalibrary/. If you are the author of articles, or are aware of articles that should be, but are not yet, in the MetaLibrary, I'll be pleased to add them.</p>
