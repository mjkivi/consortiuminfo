                  <p align="center" class="style10"><strong>STANDARDS&nbsp; AND&nbsp;  HUMAN&nbsp; RIGHTS</strong><br>
                  </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The topic of human rights is  very much in the news today, as the UN Security Counsel struggles with how to  deal with the unfolding tragedy in Darfur, Arab states criticize Israel for its  treatment of the Palestinians, the US criticizes Korea, Iran, and other  governments for their treatment of their own citizens, and the same governments  fault the US for its policies regarding captives taken in Afghanistan and  Iraq.&nbsp; Each of the above governments, of  course, defends its own conduct, claiming that it is in compliance with  international law.&nbsp; And as I write these  words, U.S. Senators are acrimoniously arguing over whether to grant the  administration the power to define what constitutes &quot;torture&quot; &ndash; a  debate that not long ago would have been difficult to imagine being held in the  halls of Congress.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Clearly, there are problems  here, not the least of which is the absence of an effective global system  authorized and able to guarantee, and intervene to prevent, abuses of human  rights when they occur.&nbsp; At times, the  very goal of some day ensuring the dignity, livelihood and opportunity &ndash; or  even the safety and freedom from starvation &ndash; of the billions of souls that are  at risk today seems beyond any realistic hope of attainment. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Among the many issues that  make this hope so challenging is one that is too often neglected, but which  falls within the scope of this journal.&nbsp;  That issue involves vitally important standards - the definitions of  human rights themselves.&nbsp; Absent  consensus on the identity and description of human rights, it is impossible to  hold anyone accountable for violating them.&nbsp;  And that is the subject of this month's <strong><em>Consortium Standards  Bulletin</em></strong>.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>,  I recall that one of the principal pillars of belief upon which modern  democracies were conceived in the late 18th century was  &quot;natural law,&quot; a conceptual framework under which every human being  was deemed to be endowed at birth (in the words of the American Declaration of  Independence) with certain &quot;inalienable rights,&quot; among which were the  rights to &quot;Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Today, the moral conviction  that every human being has inalienable &ndash; as compared to only situationally  defined &ndash; rights seems to be weakening.&nbsp;  Instead, we have rights of combatants, rights of citizens, and (some would  contend) no rights at all for some souls unlucky enough to find themselves  without a recognized treaty to protect them.&nbsp;  I suggest that true progress in guaranteeing human rights can only be  made if legalistic distinctions based on circumstance are discarded in favor of  the Founding Fathers' profound belief in an individual's innate right to be  secure in his or her basic human rights.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In this month's <strong><em>Feature  Article</em></strong>, I survey the complex and still growing infrastructure of  global and regional declarations of rights, treaties, conventions, commissions  and courts that has evolved since World War II to recognize and protect human  rights, and the degree to which they can be effective in addressing human  rights abuses today.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">My <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> essay for September asks why the nations of the world have succeeded in  creating a quasi-governmental entity (the World Trade Organization) that  nations go to great effort to join &ndash; even at the expense of subjecting  themselves to economic sanctions if found to have violated WTO rules &ndash; but have  largely refused to grant equivalent power to international courts to sanction  violations of human rights.&nbsp; Sadly, it  would appear that governments are more motivated to facilitate trade, and more  willing to cede a degree of their sovereignty in that pursuit, than they are  confident that they will respect the human rights of their own citizens.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection for this month departs from the human rights theme to provide a  reflection occasioned by the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy, observing  that the Twin Towers did not collapse because they failed to meet applicable  standards, but because the applicable standards failed to support the Towers  against the forces unleashed upon them.&nbsp;  I also reflect on the as-yet unanswered question of whether we should  adapt construction and other standards specifically to meet the potential  dangers of the post - 9/11 world, and whether we are willing to pay the price  to mandate their implementation.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, there is a <strong><em>Story  Update</em></strong> on one of the most important standards litigation stories of  recent years, involving the conduct of the participants in the JEDEC SDRAM  working group in general, and of Rambus, Inc. in particular.&nbsp; This is a saga that I have been following  since <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb03.php">February of  2003</a>, and in which I and my law firm have participated by filing a series  of <em>pro bono</em> &quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs in an effort to  support the integrity of the standards development process.<br>
                    <br>

              <p align="left" class="style2">In  contrast to 1776, the concept of human rights is today often addressed as a  relative rather than an absolute concept.&nbsp;  Despite the fact that the modern concept of democracy was in part based  upon a belief that human beings possess &quot;unalienable rights,&quot; even  democratic governments today disagree on how such rights must be honored in the  breach.&nbsp; As a result, only scattered,  selective, and in some cases haphazard mechanisms exist to permit the global  community to intervene (if so inclined) to protect the rights of the individual  against the powers of the state.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This is  not where humanity hoped it would be as it viewed the smoking wreckage of World  War II, and world leaders embarked upon an effort to rebuild their shattered  nations.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Granted,  one reason for this failure is that the founders of the United Nations decided  not to give the new institution the power to create and enforce its own  laws.&nbsp; In consequence, the United  Nations then, and still today, lacks the capability to determine that  violations of human rights are occurring, and then to intervene with force or  sanctions against the guilty party, except through the cumbersome, slow, and  often unsuccessful means of open debate.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But in a  fundamental sense, such powers would be useless absent agreement on a single  set of standards for determining precisely what rights human beings innately  possess.&nbsp; Much more impressive progress  has been made in this pursuit, but perhaps the effort to stem human rights  abuses is being undermined not by the absence of such definitions, but by the  classic case of having too many standards, each ostensibly applicable to a  different situation, time or place.&nbsp; </p>
              <div align="left" class="style2">For example, while 141 nations have ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (first approved by the United Nations in 1948), there are numerous other conventions in force that have relevance in certain situations (such as the Geneva Conventions, which address human rights in times of war), or with respect to certain practices (e.g., the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment), or within a specified geographical area (such as the European Convention on Human rights, which binds only EU nations).&nbsp;              </div>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The  unfortunate result is that in a given context, the rights of the individual can  become muddied and indistinct, and perhaps lost entirely in a fog of disputed  interpretation.&nbsp; Is a given individual  an enemy combatant, or a &quot;terrorist?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that individual's rights differ with geography, and if so,  can the rules change if the individual is moved?&nbsp; For example, if one set of rules applies at the time of capture  on the battlefield, do those rules change if the individual is transferred to  the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay, and again if transferred to the United  States itself, and yet again if he is finally subjected to rendition to a country  that does not observe international conventions against torture?&nbsp; Can it be contended that a terrorist has no  rights at all, by simply contending that terrorists are not covered by any  identified convention?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Today,  we seem to be in danger of countenancing a retreat from the 18th  century concept of &quot;inalienable rights&quot; in favor of a purely legalistic approach that looks only to the  applicability of identifiable rules to specific situations.&nbsp; The logical result of referring only to  rules of selective applicability is that if a place, or a category (or both)  can be found where those rules do not apply, then the individual is left  totally at the mercy of the state.&nbsp;  Certainly this is inconsistent with the concept of innate human rights  and the values upon which this country was founded.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">It  would seem that the only way to avoid such a result is to restore the concept  of some baseline set of inalienable rights, rights that are unabridgeable under  any circumstance, by any authority, at any time, as originally conceived by  John Locke, Thomas Paine, and, indeed, the draftsmen of the American  Declaration of Independence.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Only  by agreeing upon such a base standard of human dignity can the individual be  protected against the temptations of those in power to justify abridgement of  human rights by the exigencies of the moment.&nbsp;  Hopefully, this is one area of Constitutional interpretation upon which  liberals and strict constructionists alike, upon reflection, can find common ground.</p>

                            <em>Since the Second World War, an increasingly precisely defined and extensive list of individual, and in some cases group, entitlements has been codified that are referred to as "human rights."

That oversight is provided under an expanding  multi-layered, overlapping infrastructure of global and regional commissions, institutions and courts that are still largely supplemental to, rather than empowered to supersede the domestic laws and legal structures of member states.  A variety of non-governmental organizations also play an important "watchdog," role by exposing human rights abuses, and applying public pressure upon governments capable of curtailing such abuses.

              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Introduction: </em></strong>As the world struggled to recover from the impact of two world wars waged over a brief thirty-year period, the urgent need to remake international law to prevent future conflicts was evident as never before.  Numerous initiatives were launched in consequence that were intended to make the world a better and safer place in which to live for all of its peoples.  Initially, most of these initiatives were launched under the auspices of the new United Nations, which was chartered in 1945.</p>
              <p class="style2">Intrinsic in much of the  work of the United Nations was the recognition that its broad goals could not  be attained without first achieving consensus on the parameters of basic human  rights, and then codifying and protecting those rights.&nbsp; Absent such a foundation to inform more  specific efforts, the likelihood of creating a better world might be doomed  from the start.</p>
              <p class="style2">Seventy-one years after the  last shots of World War II were fired, the record and results of these  high-minded initiatives are at best mixed.&nbsp;  Rarely has there been a year when one or more wars have not been in  progress, and invariably there have been ongoing, and too-often egregious,  violations of human rights in multiple countries around the globe.&nbsp; While collective action has sometimes led to  the imposition of sanctions or direct intervention to stem or halt such human  rights abuses, these efforts have never been consistently applied across  equally compelling circumstances, and when action has been taken, it has  typically commenced only after a long and protracted effort to reach consensus  on the right to act and the method to employ, and to gather a sufficient number  of nations willing to participate in order to make the effort effective.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">As a result, human rights  violations have been continuous, and even horrific episodes of genocide have  been all to frequent.&nbsp; The worst abuses  have often occurred in Africa, but Europe, where memories of the events of  World War II remain fresh, witnessed the disintegration of the former  Yugoslavia and the occurrence of human rights abuses that Europeans hoped would  never be seen on that continent again.&nbsp;  Millions have died around the world in consequence, and many more  continue to lead blighted lives of poverty, fear and disease, particularly  where corrupt elites are in power.</p>
              <p class="style2">Nor have allegations of  human rights violations been made only against third world nations or rogue  Balkan leaders.&nbsp; Western nations still  accuse China of violating the human rights of its citizens, and the United  States has been accused not only by foreign critics, but by its own concerned  citizens as well, of violating the human rights of captives taken in  Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
              <p class="style2">It would be easy to conclude  that the challenge of achieving a worldwide guarantee of human rights is simply  the classic one of national sovereignty refusing to cede any real power to  collective action.&nbsp; And in fact this is  part of the problem, as the United Nations was not created with the power to  make laws that it can directly enforce against its own member states.</p>
              <p class="style2">Notwithstanding the fact  that initial post-war hopes have not been fully realized, substantial (if  inconsistent) progress has been made in the effort to secure human rights.&nbsp; Today, there is much to point to that gives  hope for the future, including the ratification of numerous treaties  recognizing and protecting human rights of all types, the formation of regional  bodies able to protect human rights, a growing body of international law to  support the efforts of individuals as well as intervening nations in the  defense of human rights, and perhaps most importantly, an increasingly  consistent global consensus regarding the nature and description of specific  human rights - in effect, the standards by which human rights can be  recognized, and thereby uniformly protected.</p>
              <p class="style2">While not strictly speaking  &quot;standards&quot; in the usual sense, human rights are nonetheless very  similar in concept and creation to other useful products of voluntary,  consensus processes: they are abstractions that have useful meaning only when a  community of interest agrees to define them and apply them; they become more  powerful and useful when uniformly adopted internationally; such adoption is  voluntary; they achieve important societal goals; and they are maintained by  institutions created specifically for that purpose.&nbsp; As a result of these similarities, it can be instructive to view  human rights in the context of standards generally, particularly as regards  what may be learned from the successes (and failures) of those active in the  development, promotion and use of each type of consensus-based end product, and  how the experiences of one discipline may benefit the other.</p>
              <p class="style2">This article will survey the  types of rights that are recognized today, the treaties and authorities under  which they exist, and the principal means by which they are protected.&nbsp; In closing, it will reflect on the adequacy  of this infrastructure to achieve its intended purpose.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognized Human Rights</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">The  primary role of any government is (or should be) to protect the security and  welfare of its citizens.&nbsp; Unfortunately,  that role has rarely, if ever, been perfectly achieved by real-world  governments. <a href="#1">1</a>                This evident and ongoing  failure gives rise to a need for international agreement on the identity and  description of those rights that every government may be expected to respect,  in order to provide a standard against which a government's actual behavior may  be measured.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Human rights categories:</em></strong>&nbsp; Human rights are comparatively easy to agree  upon at the original natural law level of abstraction. <a href="#2">2</a> Concepts such as the right  to be &quot;free&quot; and &quot;secure in one's person&quot; are hard to  contest, and are otherwise consistent with democratic values and the general  understanding of the obligations of a government to protect its citizens.&nbsp; But in the first instance, what does  &quot;free&quot; mean?&nbsp; And in the  second, are their situations in which infringements should be permitted to even  such a basic human right?&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">For example, does  &quot;free&quot; mean both physically as well as politically free?&nbsp; If both, then is incarceration consistent  with the concept of human rights, and if so, to what extent?&nbsp; At what point does duration of incarceration  for a given crime become excessive, and what obligations does the state have to  protect the prisoner from abuse once under the control of his jailers?</p>
              <p class="style2">Distinguishing rights from honorable aspirations  is also challenging.&nbsp; Is equal  employment opportunity an elective concept that a given country is free to  enshrine in law, or a basic human liberty that every country should  guarantee?&nbsp; Perhaps surprisingly,  general agreement on almost all currently identified categories of human rights  (if not consensus on each specific right) was achieved and codified in the  Universal Declaration.&nbsp; Those categories  can be generally identified as follows: <a href="#3">3</a> </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Security rights:</strong>&nbsp; These       are the rights that respect the right of the individual to be secure       against physical abuse, and address dangers such as murder, torture and       rape. Unlike many of the rights that follow, these rights have been       addressed by laws from ancient times.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Due process rights:</strong>&nbsp; These       rights protect the individual from the abuse of the powers of the state,       and prohibit practices such as secret trials, imprisonment without being       charged, and unreasonable punishment.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Liberty rights:</strong>&nbsp; These       rights acknowledge freedoms of movement, speech, association, religious       belief, and the like.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Political rights:</strong>&nbsp; These       address the right of the individual to meaningfully participate in the       political process by voting, advocating and assembling, and to run for       elective office.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Equality rights:</strong>&nbsp; These       are the rights that recognize equality before the law, nondiscrimination,       and similar freedoms.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Social (or &quot;welfare&quot;) rights:</strong>&nbsp; These       rights do not protect the individual from the state, but recognize duties       of the state to its citizens to ameliorate suffering from (for example)       extreme poverty and hunger.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Group rights:</strong>&nbsp; This conceptual category       is not represented directly in the Universal Declaration, but is achieving       attention today.&nbsp; Group rights       address abuses that may be directed at ethnic or religious groups (e.g.,       genocide), and the rights of countries to be protected from foreign       exploitation of their resources.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Individual human  rights:</em></strong>&nbsp; Individual human rights present their own  challenges of definition and reasonability of expectation.&nbsp; One challenge resulting from recognizing so  many different desirable goals as actual rights is the evident impossibility of  guaranteeing equal access to all of them.&nbsp;  For example, few nations in Africa (or, perhaps, anywhere) today could  guarantee full social rights to their citizens, if this would require a  government to feed, clothe, employ, educate and provide modern health care to  everyone of its people.&nbsp; In contrast, it  would be reasonable, and indeed imperative, to expect every nation, regardless  of economic situation, to ensure almost all of the other rights referred to  above.</p>
              <p class="style2">Achieving uniformity of  definition and application of human rights at the national level can also be  problematic:&nbsp; some rights necessarily  include subjective elements (how much punishment for a given crime, and of what  type, is consistent with human rights?), and others may have local cultural or  religious connotations (must all punishments provided for under <em>Sharia</em> law &ndash; such as amputation of the hand or foot of an incorrigible thief - by  definition be consistent with human rights?&nbsp;  If not, does this imply that international law has the right to overrule  the laws laid down by the Prophet?).&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Variations (justifiable or  otherwise) can be addressed through the establishment of regional rights  bodies, and others through the adoption of human rights treaties by individual  national governments with &quot;reservations&quot; (i.e., the reserved right to  take exception to specific provisions of the treaty that would otherwise be  binding).&nbsp; Variations are also  guaranteed by the fact that parties to treaties are usually required to make  their internal laws consistent with treaties, rather than to adopt the type of  specific, mandatory language that could provide more uniform protection of  human rights on a global basis.</p>
              <p class="style2">Even where there is little  difference of opinion over the importance of given rights, situations may  justifiably (or expediently) permit the playing off of one right against  another, as when martial law is imposed by a government under claim of  protecting the security of the people.&nbsp;  Such an action ostensibly honors the obligation of the state to protect  the physical well being of its citizens, but may do so at the expense of  political and other valuable rights.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Notwithstanding such questions of rights  interpretation and relativity, treaties sometimes recognize that some types of  rights are more fundamental than others, and therefore must be more strictly  protected.&nbsp; For example, the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allows certain rights to  be suspended under extreme circumstances (during a time &quot;of public  emergency which threatens the life of the nation&quot; (article 4)).&nbsp; However, this right of suspension does not  permit taking life, engaging in torture, imposing slavery, conviction under  laws adopted after the fact, or the suspension of freedom of religion or  thought. <a href="#4">4</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Infrastructure</strong></p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>International</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Although the global  divisiveness brought about by the Cold War temporarily slowed human rights  progress, the infrastructure of human rights recognition and enforcement has  nonetheless grown substantially from its post-war beginnings.&nbsp; This ongoing proves involves the continuing  adoption of new treaties, increasing recognition of the authority of rights  recognized under older treaties, and the creation of new authorities and  organizations charged with protecting human rights.&nbsp; Today, there is a complex and growing global infrastructure that  seeks to identify, legislate, and protect human rights, comprising courts,  commissions, regional rights organizations, non-governmental watchdogs, and  more.&nbsp; While the failures of this  infrastructure are all too evident in a given case, the forward march of  progress becomes more meaningful and encouraging when the long view is taken. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>The United Nations:</em></strong> <a href="#5">5</a> The fundamental role of  human rights in the mission of the United Nations is recognized in its  Preamble, which directs it &quot;... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in  the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women  and of nations large and small.&hellip;&quot; </p>
              <span class="style2">Although  it cannot create and enforce laws as such, the United Nations does serve as the  venue within which treaties and conventions are negotiated that, when ratified  by any given member state, usually obligate that state to pass and enforce  internal laws that are consistent with that treaty.&nbsp; The United Nations also supports commissions and committees,  among other activities that support the effectiveness of these treaties once  they have entered into force. <a href="#6">6</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treaties and conventions:</em></strong>&nbsp; Many of the most important human rights  treaties in force today have been developed within the United Nations  structure, and these treaties also often act as the reference points for  regionally adopted treaties as well.&nbsp;  They include the following:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><a href="http://www.criminaljusticedegree.net/resources/prevention-and-punishment-of-genocide/">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a> (1948):&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the Genocide       Convention was the earliest human rights treaty finalized after the Second       World War.&nbsp; It was approved one day       before the Universal Declaration was itself adopted.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal       Declaration of Human Rights</a> (1948):&nbsp;       Although not itself binding on all nations, most of the standards       recommended by the Universal Declaration, most of the rights and       principles codified in the Universal Declaration were subsequently       incorporated into other treaties that were ratified by large numbers of       member states.&nbsp; These treaties in       turn require signatory nations to enact legislation that brings their       internal laws into compliance with these individual treaties.&nbsp; The conventions and treaties that       accomplish this result include those listed below.<br>

              <span class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Commissions and Committees</u>:</em></strong>&nbsp; There are two human-rights related  commissions (the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#commission">Commission on Human Rights</a> (1946)  and the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/2/sc.htm">Subcommission on the Promotion  and Protection of Human Rights</a> (1946)) and seven standing committees (<a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#torture">Committee against Torture</a>, <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#social">Committee on Economic,  Social and Cultural Rights, </a><a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#women">Committee on the Elimination  of Discrimination against Women, </a><a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#racial">Committee on the  Elimination of Racial Discrimination, </a><a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#migrant">Committee on the  Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, </a><a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#child">Committee on the Rights of  the Child, </a><a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/#rights">Human  Rights Committee</a>). <a href="#10">10</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">t  is important to note the distinction between United Nations Commissions and  Committees.&nbsp; The former derive their  authority from the Charter of the United Nations itself, and therefore address  all member states.&nbsp; The standing  committees in contrast have been formed to address the subjects of the specific  treaties to which they relate, and the authority of a committee therefore  extends only to the member states that have ratified the treaty or convention  in question.&nbsp; As a result, actions  relating to commissions are subject to full United Nations member voting, while  each of the latter are controlled by the consensus of the relevant signatory  nations.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Agencies and Courts</u>:</em></strong> In addition to the two  treaty-independent human rights commissions, the United Nations also supports a  number of agencies and courts that concern themselves with human rights issues  and abuses.&nbsp; They include:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/">United Nations High Commissioner for       Human Rights</a> (1993):&nbsp; This post       was created to provide a full-time advocate of human rights issues within       the United Nations itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The       Commissioner also coordinates all activities under existing and       contemplated human rights treaties.</li>

              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (2006):&nbsp; This Council succeeded to       the work of the former Human Rights Commission in dealing with egregious       violations of human rights.&nbsp; The       new 47 member council is structured and subject to rules that are intended       to make it less political than its predecessor, and less likely to include       representatives of states with poor human rights records.</li>

              <span class="style2"><strong><em>International Criminal Court:</em></strong>&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/statesparties.html">International Criminal Court</a> came into existence as a result of an initiative that came to fruition at the <a href="http://www.un.org/icc/index.htm" title="this link will open in a new window">United Nations Diplomatic  Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International  Criminal Court</a>.&nbsp; At that conference, the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Rome Statute of  the International Criminal Court</a> was approved, calling for the  establishment of the International Criminal Court as a permanent international tribunal,  modeled on the several tribunals that had been created in the past to address  specific egregious human rights abuses (the Nuremberg Tribunal, International  Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for  Rwanda).&nbsp; The Court came into being in  2002 upon ratification of the Rome Statute by the requisite sixty nations, and  was installed at The Hague.&nbsp; As of  January, 2006, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/statesparties.html">100 nations</a> have ratified the Rome Statute.<a href="#11">11</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">Like  its predecessor tribunals, the International Criminal Court is authorized to  address the crimes of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.&nbsp; Under the Rome Statute, it is also nominally  authorized to address the crime of waging war illegally (&quot;aggression  against another state&quot;), but only after that crime has been defined and  related conditions are formalized and approved.&nbsp; The Court operates under two adopted documents: the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/asp/1stsession/report/english/part_ii_a_e.pdf" title="this link will open in a new window">Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/asp/1stsession/report/english/part_ii_b_e.pdf" title="this link will open in a new window">Elements of Crimes</a>, each of  which was adopted by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/asp.html">Assembly of  States Parties</a>, which oversees the Court.&nbsp;  A third document, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Regulations_of_the_Court_170604-EN.pdf">Regulations  of the Court</a>, was adopted by the judges of the court, completing the  authority for the jurisdiction, function and structure of the Court.</p>
              <p class="style2">The  International Criminal Court is supplementary to, rather than senior to, the  courts of its signatory states, in that it is unable to intervene if the nation  in question has a valid judicial procedure in process to address the same  alleged abuse.</p>
              <p class="style2">Under  the Statute, an Office of the Prosecutor was established, empowered to receive  complaints, investigate and prosecute.&nbsp;  With the establishment of this permanent tribunal, the threat of  possible consequences for egregious actions taken under authority of a state,  with the complicity of a state, or that might otherwise be ignored by the  government of a state, became more credible.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Geneva Conventions:</em></strong>&nbsp; The Geneva  Conventions comprise four treaties and three amendment protocols with a  venerable heritage that precedes the foundation of the United Nations by more  than eighty years.&nbsp; The first Geneva Convention  was adopted in 1864 by sixteen European nations at a conference convened by the  Geneva Society for Public Welfare (which later became the International  Committee of the Red Cross), and the last was adopted in 1949.&nbsp; The two substantive protocols (the third  relates to the adoption of an emblem) were both approved in 1977.</p>
              <p class="style2">The <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/First_Geneva_Convention">first</a> of  the four Geneva conventions addresses the rights and needs of sick and wounded  combatants on the field, and the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Second_Geneva_Convention">second</a> of the  sick and wounded at sea; the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Third_Geneva_Convention">third</a> addresses the humane treatment of <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">prisoners of war</a>; and the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention">last</a> the  protection of civilians &quot;in Times of War.&quot;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm">first</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm">second</a> of the  two substantive protocols relate to the protection of victims of armed  international conflicts and of non-international conflicts, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; The four conventions had been ratified by  194 of the world's 200 countries as of June 27, 2006.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Other conventions and treaties:</em></strong>&nbsp; There are a  variety of other conventions and treaties that could be included under the  general heading of human rights.&nbsp; These  agreements address additional areas of concern, such as the rights of refugees,  the outlawing of <a href="http://www.icbl.org/treaty/text/english">landmines</a>,  and other concerns.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>International Law</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">A growing body  of law is emerging as a result of the various treaties, conventions,  complaints, interventions and other activities taken in support of human  rights.&nbsp; As this body of law grows, it  becomes more persuasive, influential and useful by all of those active in the  protection of human rights.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Various efforts are in process to support the compilation and  institutionalization of international law.&nbsp;  One such effort that focuses on human rights is the <a href="http://www.ihlresearch.org/ihl/portalhome.php">International Humanitarian  Law Research Initiative</a>, which advances the so-called &quot;Alabama  Process&quot; (named after the room in the City of Geneva in which the first  Geneva Convention was adopted in 1864).</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Regional</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">The United Nations (and  particularly its Universal Declaration of Human Rights) remains in many  respects the fountainhead of the modern human rights infrastructure.&nbsp; However, it is neither the only, nor, in a  given case, necessarily the most effective body to secure a given goal.&nbsp; At times, a regional authority has led,  rather than followed, the United Nations in its recognition and protection of  human rights, and the nations of Europe are notable for the degree of authority  that they have ceded to their regional human rights institutions.&nbsp; </p>
              <span class="style2">There  are currently three principal regional authorities that address human rights  issues, each of which has adopted its own declarations, rules, and sometimes  courts to address human rights issues. <a href="#12">12</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Europe:</em></strong>&nbsp; The initial  treaty respecting human rights adopted in Europe is the <a href="http://www.hrcr.org/docs/Eur_Convention/euroconv.html">Convention for the  Protection of Human Rights</a> (1950), a significant document in that it was  the first agreement under which signatory states consented to enforcement of  domestic human rights by an external body.&nbsp;  With the expansion of the European Union, the number of states that are  members of this convention has rapidly expanded.&nbsp; As of this writing, 45 Western, Central and Eastern European  states are members.&nbsp; Social rights are  covered under a separate treaty, the <a href="http://www.hrcr.org/docs/Eur_Convention/euroconv.html">European Social  Charter</a> (1961).</p>
              <p class="style2">Under the Convention, member  states consent to a significant degree of external authority, including  subjecting themselves to the jurisdiction of a standing (since 1998) human  rights court: the European Court of Human Rights, which presides in Strasbourg,  France.&nbsp; Individuals, and less  frequently nations, bring complaints to this court, which first attempts to  mediate a resolution.&nbsp; Failing such a  resolution, the court has the authority to issue a judgment and require  appropriate remedies.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Pan-America:</em></strong>&nbsp; The  Organization of American States came into being with the execution of the <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/charter.html">OAS Charter</a> in 1948  by 21 original member states; 35 countries in the western hemisphere are now  members.&nbsp; All members are signatory to  two relevant documents: the <a href="http://www.cidh.org/Basicos/basic2.htm" target="other">American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man</a> (1948) and the <a href="http://www.cidh.org/Basicos/basic3.htm">American Convention on Human  Rights</a>.&nbsp; Although this declaration  was adopted prior to the Universal Declaration, the Convention, which legally  enabled the rights and duties identified in the declaration, was not adopted  until 1969, and did not take effect until 1978.&nbsp; Unlike the Universal Declaration, the American Convention  recognizes duties (such as the duties to work and pay taxes) of individuals as  well as rights.&nbsp; A third treaty, the <a href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/globalrights/treaties/achr-esc.html" target="other">Protocol of San Salvador</a> (1988), address social rights.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">The rights recognized under these two documents are addressed by two permanent  bodies:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><a href="http://www.cidh.org/" target="other">Inter-American Commission on       Human Rights</a> (1959):&nbsp; the       Commission is empowered to investigate and report on human rights abuses,       but is not authorized to apply sanctions or remedies.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Commission has been       extremely active in investigating many hundreds of cases alleging       individual violations of human rights.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><a href="http://www.cidh.org/Basicos/basic17.htm" target="other">Inter-American       Court of Human Rights</a> (1979): The Court was established under       authority of the Statute of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, has       authority to hear cases submitted by the Inter-American Commission on       Human Rights and by member states, and is emplowered to apply the       provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights to the facts       presented.</li>
              </ul>
              <span class="style2"><strong><em>Africa:</em></strong>&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African  Union</a> replaced the Organization of African Unity in 2000.&nbsp; The underlying <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/Text/Banjul%20Charter.pdf" target="other">African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights</a> (1981) had been  ratified by 53 nations as of 2006.&nbsp; Like  the American Declaration, the African Charter recognizes duties of  individuals.&nbsp; It also recognizes group  rights, including some of particular historical significance, such as the right  to be free of foreign political domination, and the right to protect domestic  natural resources from foreign exploitation.&nbsp;  An <a href="http://www.pict-pcti.org/courts/ACHPR.html">African Court of  Human and Peoples' Rights</a> was established under a protocol adopted in 1998  which took effect in 2004 upon its approval by 15 member states.&nbsp; However, as of this writing, the court has  not yet been established. <a href="#13">13</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Individual Government Action</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Individual countries from time to time include the curtailment of  international human rights abuses in their foreign policy goals.&nbsp; Since such activities are self-determined  rather than obligatory under treaties, however, such goals may change over time  (and particularly as administrations change), may focus on some human rights  over others, and the country in question remains free to turn a blind eye to  the abuses of particular countries that would be diplomatically inconvenient to  offend at any particular point in time.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">International human rights practices can also be incorporated into  legislation, thereby seeking to regularize such practices.&nbsp; For example, in the United States, sections 116(d) and 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance  Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended, and section 504 of the Trade Act of 1974, as  amended require the Secretary of State to supply to the Speaker of the House of  Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, by  February 25 in each year:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">[A] full and complete report regarding the  status of internationally recognized human rights, within the meaning of  subsection (A) in countries that receive assistance under this part, and (B) in  all other foreign countries which are members of the United Nations and which  are not otherwise the subject of a human rights report under this Act. <a href="#14">14</a> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Non-Governmental  Organizations</strong> </p>
              <p class="style2">National, global and  regional Non-governmental organizations (often referred to simply as  &quot;NGOs&quot;) play an important &quot;watchdog&quot; function, providing  multiple points of contact for individuals and groups that have suffered from  human rights abuses.&nbsp; These  organizations investigate and raise public awareness of such conditions, and  the more powerful NGOs that focus on human rights issues can bring significant  public pressure on governments by bringing failures to act, as well as actual  abuses, to world attention.</p>
              <p class="style2">The breadth of approach and  scope of NGOs concerned with human rights issues is suggested by the following  brief summaries of a few well-known NGOs: </p>

              <p class="style2"><strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Since the end of the Second  World War an increasingly comprehensive infrastructure for the identification  and protection of human rights has developed around the world, comprising  overlapping global, regional, national, and private means for protecting the  rights of not only individuals, but to classes and groups of people identified  by criteria such as ethnicity, disability and gender.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Today, this infrastructure  is still largely lacks sufficient power and authority to intervene in the  domestic affairs of individual nations.&nbsp;  However, there is a trend that is flowing in this direction, as  evidenced by the establishment of standing courts and tribunals specifically  created to address the most severe of human rights abuses, consensus on the  identification and description of specific human rights, and a growing body of  international law based upon the actions of the various treaty groups and other  bodies addressing human rights.&nbsp;  Nonetheless, this infrastructure is still almost entirely supplemental,  rather than senior to, the sovereign rights of nations.</p>
              <p class="style2">It remains to be seen  whether the further evolution of this infrastructure will slow and stall at the  boundary of states rights, or will serve as the foundation upon which a more  powerful, global legal system focused on realizing the goals of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights is built.&nbsp;  Today, there does not appear to be sufficient momentum or global outcry  to compel the nations of the world to surrender the degree of domestic control  needed to achieve the latter.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Hopefully, if this impasse  is some day broken, it will not be as a result of human rights abuses that are  even more extreme and horrific than those that have occurred so recently in  Kosovo, Rwanda, Uganda, Liberia, Darfur, and elsewhere.</p>

                <p align="left" class="style56"> <strong> [][][] <strong> September 29, 2006</strong> </strong></p>
                <p><span class="style56"><em>#42</em></span><strong class="style38"><em> Sovereignty, World Trade and Human Rights</em></strong></p>
                <p class="style2">In 1948,  the newly formed United Nations announced a great event with appropriate  fanfare: the unveiling of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal  Declaration of Human Rights</a>.&nbsp; The  dream was that through this and other international efforts, many of the  horrors of the first half of the 20th Century could be left behind  by a world that had much that it wished to forget.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">With  time, 141 nations signed and duly ratified the Declaration.&nbsp; But sad to say, despite the fact that the  Declaration is now acknowledged to be the global consensus agreement defining  human rights, its provisions have been violated on a daily basis in many parts  of the world from then until today.&nbsp;  Over time, the offenses visited by corrupt regimes, violent dictators,  and ethnic majorities seem to be becoming more, rather than less violent and  horrific.&nbsp; Today, each disaster that  goes unpunished is speedily followed by the next.&nbsp; To recite but a few:&nbsp;  Rwanda, Congo, Darfur, Kosovo, Liberia&hellip;the litany of horrors seems  endless.</p>
                <p class="style2">In part,  this is due to the degree of difficulty involved in agreeing upon and engaging  in collective action through the United Nations.&nbsp; Only rarely does the international community achieve the degree  of consensus required to successfully navigate the bureaucracy, veto rights and  process necessary to achieve such a result.&nbsp;  Even the new International Criminal Court, established as a standing  tribunal in 2002, is only designed to address abuses after the fact.&nbsp; Even then, it only possesses the authority  to act with respect to crimes involving the nationals of signatory nations and  such other countries as might consent to its jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="style2">In  consequence, while the actions being taken today on many fronts to secure human  rights are many and honorable, from pressure applied by individual or allied  nations against abusive regimes to the significant activities and initiatives  of a myriad of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the ability of a  government to abuse its citizens remains today largely unchecked.</p>
                <p class="style2">At the  heart of the matter lies the conundrum that has handicapped most post-war  efforts to make the world a better place through collective action: the  reticence of many nations to allow any external force to place any limits on what  it can do, either externally, or (more emotionally) internally.&nbsp; After 71 years of only partial progress in  the face of ongoing and terrible abuses, the cause of human rights can seem  hopeless.</p>
                <p class="style2">Must  this be so?&nbsp; Perhaps not, if one  considers this:</p>
                <p class="style2">On  January 1, 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) replaced the General Treaty  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).&nbsp; GATT was  another international post-war initiative launched in an attempt to build a  more peaceful and rational world.&nbsp; Today  the WTO is not only strong and successful, but nations (such as China)  willingly undergo long, strenuous and difficult transformations of their entire  economies to accede to WTO membership.</p>
                <p class="style2">One  example of efforts undertaken under the auspices of the WTO that is familiar to  readers of this journal is the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/17-tbt_e.htm">Act on Technical  Barriers to Trade</a> (ATBT), which (among other goals) seeks to prevent the  use of standards and conformance testing to unfairly benefit domestic commerce  at the expense of international trade.&nbsp;  As with many other restrictions imposed under the WTO, member states  give up numerous rights at home in order to enjoy a more level playing field  for their own goods and services in the marketplaces of the world.</p>
                <p class="style2">The  WTO/ATBT system, while hardly perfect, does provide a set of rules within which  the standards created through the voluntary consensus process may be given  greater force through quasi-governmental authority.&nbsp; In practice, the WTO operates as a forum within which the rules  of international trade are set, but not one that has the authority to bring  actions to enforce those rules.&nbsp;  Instead, it provides a venue (the Dispute Settlement Body) within which individual  members may bring charges against other members, and resolve their disputes  with the threat of WTO-approved sanctions to back up the rulings of WTO  arbiters.</p>
                <p class="style2">Under  the due process provisions of the WTO/ATBT, complaints can be brought  confidentially, permitting investigation prior to publicity, and decisions can  be appealed.&nbsp; If the dispute resolution  process fails to resolve issues, the WTO can impose meaningful sanctions  against the guilty party, and in favor of the country or countries that brought  the original complaint to the attention of the WTO.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">While  this process has its clear weaknesses (for example, a sanction that favors a  large importer/exporter hits the guilty party far harder than one that benefits  a small country, meaning that sanctions that favor a small country can easily  be ignored by a large one), it nonetheless represents a remarkable achievement  of international resolve and cooperation.&nbsp;  In the less than eleven years of the WTO's existence, about <a href="http://www.wto.org/English/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_subjects_index_e.htm">300  disputes</a> have been brought to its Dispute Settlement Body.&nbsp; Most of these disputes have been resolved,  resulting in a more orderly and fully functional international marketplace.</p>
                <p class="style2">Why is  it that the nations of the world assembled in congress can reach agreement on  the rules of international trade and go to great lengths to subject themselves  to the WTO's authority, but have not set themselves the goal of providing an  equally effective means of protecting elementary human rights?</p>
                <p class="style2">The answers  are not immediately obvious.&nbsp; After all,  the rules endorsed by the WTO are humanistic as well as commercial, including  (for example) the principle of providing greater flexibility to evolving  economies than developed ones.&nbsp;  Similarly, allowing an international body to control domestic trade in  important respects is arguably as great, or greater, a concession to national  sovereignty than agreeing to basic principles of human dignity.</p>
                <p class="style2">Similarly,  the United Nations does succeed on occasion in achieving consensus around the  condemnation of human rights violations, and even on intervention by  UN-authorized peacekeeping forces, despite the hurdles that stand in the way of  such a result.&nbsp; What is needed is a  standing commission with respected, neutral arbiters with the power to act,  rather than a difficult and time-consuming ad hoc process.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">Why then  does the WTO have powers that the United Nations does not?&nbsp; It seems both tragic and comic that a system  exists that can provide meaningful sanctions for trade abuses involving music  in bars, pet food and solid urea, while the United Nations can only dither  while children starve in Darfur.</p>
                <p class="style2">The  reasons, sadly, are several.&nbsp; Among them  are that commercial forces have traditionally been more politically influential  than humanitarian ones, and that repressive regimes traditionally have more to  fear from their poor than from their commercial upper classes.</p>
                <p class="style2">Still,  the WTO experience demonstrates that the goal of achieving consensus around  enforceable constraints, and even socially informed rules, can be  achieved.&nbsp; It's long overdue for the  same dedication that has been directed at achieving fair trade to be focused on  protecting human dignity as well.</p>

              <p align="left" class="style56"><strong>Monday, September 11, 2006, @ 8:13 AM, EDT</strong></p>
              <span class="style2"><img border="0" width="48" height="48" src="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/images/icons/earth.jpg" align="right" alt="Standards and Society"></span>
              <p class="style2"><em>Nova</em> aired an excellent program last night called <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=27203&episode_id=2909563%20">Building on Ground Zero</a>, and has    what may be a long-term page set up <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/wtc/">here</a>, with a variety of stories, slideshows and interviews    on the same topic. The show was memorable for many reasons, one of which was    its focuson  both the importance as well as the economic calculus of standards. Another was  the degree to which the US is lagging in the upgrading of crucial standards  identified in the wake of the 9/11 catastrophe, although a number of Asian  nations have apparently taken to heart the lessons learned five years ago  today.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">It's  rare that standards are featured so prominently in a documentary, and even more  unusual for them to be dealt with so clearly and intelligently. The WGBH team  behind the <em>Nova</em> program derived much of its data from the detailed  investigation performed by the National Institute of Science and Technology  (NIST) and the final recommendations of that agency. The 30 detailed <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/recommendations/recommendations.htm">recommendations</a> offered by NIST  cover a broad range of topics, including upgrading of materials, reexamining  existing safety margins, improving communications, providing for more effective  evacuation capabilities, and much more. <em>Nova</em> reports that implementing  all of the engineering-related recommendations, if I recall correctly, would  add a total of about 5% to total building costs.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Tellingly,  the experts interviewed on the program conclude that the Twin Towers were not  only adequately designed, but indeed had been engineered with a degree of  ingenuity that permitted them to withstand the infernos that raged within them  quite well before the towers ultimately collapsed. What failed, therefore, was  not the design &ndash; but many of the standards to which the design was built.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Many of the standards evaluated by NIST involved matters as simple  as the width of emergency stairways (44 inches), which may have been adequate  decades ago at a time of narrower Americans, but which on 9/11 led to far fewer  people walking side by side than might have been the case had the stairs simply  been required to be wider. And had communications standards enable more  effective&nbsp; communications, more fireman  would have known after the first tower collapsed to turn and head downwards  with the flow, rather than to continue upwards to their deaths against it,  thereby also slowing the escape of those inside.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Other standards that could be changed and implemented without the  development of new processes or materials relate to fireproofing materials.  Current standards still allow the type of spray-on foam that is presumed to  have been extensively dislodged by the impact of the jets that struck the  towers. <em>Nova</em> reports that there are existing processes and materials  that adhere far more tenaciously, but which are more expensive. Will they be  required in the future? <em>Should</em> they be?</p>
              <p class="style2">                That last question may seem surprising, in light of the horrors of  9/11. But, as one engineer bluntly stated during the program &quot;I want good  value for my standards.&quot; His point was that to engineer every building to  withstand the impact of a terrorist-piloted plane would flunk a cost/benefit  analysis. And clearly, he is right &ndash; the likelihood, or even the possibility &ndash;  that such a plane would hit a tall building that does not stand high above  those that surround it is almost nil. That being so, why spend the extra 5%?</p>
              <p class="style2">                The question, then, is partly one of assumptions. Prior to 9/11,  the assumption was that sprinkler systems and other design features would  contain a fire in a tall building, limiting its effects to one or at most a few  floors, and that full evacuation of the building would not even be necessary as  a strict matter of safety.&nbsp; As <em>Nova</em> reports, that assumption has historically been borne out by facts, with c.  53,000 people per year dying in residential fires, but only hundreds in total  perishing in all large building catastrophes that occurred prior to 9/11.</p>
              <p class="style2">                So how much should the standards change? NIST concludes that the  standards applicable to all buildings should prevent the type of failure and  loss of life that occurred on 9/11. <em>Nova</em> does not seek to answer that  question, but does an honest job of presenting it, as well as reporting on  those buildings that are being constructed today that are electively adopting  some of the same NIST recommendations.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Clearly, of course, the matter need not be one of all or nothing.  Wider and more greatly dispersed stairwells, redundant standpipes serving  sprinkler systems and other design elements that might have the greatest impact  and could be implemented using existing technology, as well as reexamination of  the types of fire resistant materials available and their virtues, deserve  consideration, at least for those buildings that are demonstrably at risk.</p>
              <p class="style2">                More troubling is the fact that in five years not all of the  needed communications standards have been developed and deployed, despite the  myriad initiatives launched, and the billions of dollars of government funding  that have already been spent upgrading communications equipment.&nbsp; It seems incredible that this should be the  case, and there can be no question that enabling the effective communication of  first responders is a matter of daily, rather than only exceptional need.</p>
              <span class="style2">Sadly, it seems that in  standards, as in so many other areas, the lessons of 9/11 have been strangely  difficult to agree and act upon. One would have hoped that five years on we  would have managed to make better progress, given the starkness of the wake up  call.</span>

                <p class="style2">                  The FTC is now in the process of deciding what penalties should be  levied against Rambus.&nbsp; In support of  that process, it may hold additional hearings at which Rambus and the FTC  prosecuting attorney may present arguments on that issue.&nbsp; The FTC also announced that it would welcome  industry advice on the penalties, setting a deadline of September 18 for  presentation of <em>amicus curiae</em> (friend of the court) briefs, four of  which were filed (including one filed by Gesmer Updegrove LLP and myself on a <em>pro  bono</em> basis, the fourth such brief we have filed in relation to this  case).&nbsp; The <em>amicus</em> briefs, together  with the briefs on the penalty question filed by the FTC and Rambus, may be  found at the FTC <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/adjpro/d9302/index.htm">Rambus  docket page</a>.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  The most recent decision by the FTC is only the latest in the  series of dramatic reversals that has typified the course of the web of  lawsuits that have been filed by Rambus against four DRAM manufacturers  (Infineon Technologies, Hynix Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics, and Micron  Technologies); by the same manufacturers against Rambus; by antitrust  regulators against Rambus; and by the same regulators against the same DRAM  manufacturers, charging them with a price fixing conspiracy against Rambus  relating to the same technology.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  The  decision by the FTC represents a vitally important ratification by the FTC of  the need to enforce rules of trust in standard setting, and follows on a series  of early victories by Rambus that threatened to undermine the credibility of  the standard setting process.&nbsp; In  response to those victories, scores of standard setting organizations  reexamined and amended their intellectual property rights policies, in an  effort to make it more difficult for those with ill intent to &quot;game&quot;  their processes.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  While a detailed review of the complete, tangled history of the  Rambus litigation would require many thousands of words, the following  describes the principal events to date.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  All of the litigation and investigations arose from the conduct of  the same participants in the same standard setting effort within the Joint  Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) in the 1990s.&nbsp; The standards  under development in that effort would dictate the designs of hundreds of  millions of DRAM chips worth billions of dollars in revenues &ndash; and even  billions of dollars in royalties to anyone owning patents essential to those  designs.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  Rambus, it was alleged, dropped out of the standard setting  process prior to the time when it would have been required to disclose any  patents that would be infringed by the implementation of the standards being  developed.&nbsp; After the standard was approved and widely adopted (or, in the  words of antitrust law, after the market had become &quot;locked in&quot;), it  began to contact the chip vendors that were implementing the standards, and  demanding royalties from them &ndash; in short, surfacing and threatening to fire the  torpedoes after setting a classic &quot;submarine patent&quot; trap.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The four vendors referred to above refused to pay up, and all were  sued by Rambus.&nbsp; The case that advanced  most quickly was the suit brought against Infineon Technologies, a German  semiconductor company.&nbsp; At trial, Rambus's conduct came to light &ndash; as did  the fact that it had destroyed large&nbsp;numbers of documents, presumably in  an effort to avoid the disclosure of its actions.&nbsp; The judge presiding in  the Virginia federal district court in which the document destruction was  revealed was greatly angered, and as a result refused to honor the  attorney-client privilege between Rambus and its counsel, allowing other  written evidence to reach the jury.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  Those materials included notes from Rambus's own counsel, advising  Rambus that it was violating JEDEC's rules by not disclosing its patents.&nbsp;  Not surprisingly, the jury found for Infineon, and the judge directed Rambus to  reimburse Infineon for millions of dollars in attorney's fees, in addition to  other monetary damages.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The standard setting world heaved a sigh of relief when the  decision was announced, because the standard setting process is built primarily  on trust.&nbsp; After all, if one can gain more by cheating than by obeying the  rules, then there are only two ways to react &ndash; either by cheating as well, or  by refusing to adopt standards at all.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  But the relief was short lived.&nbsp; Rambus appealed the trial  court decision to the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent-related  appeals.&nbsp; Most observers expected the same judgment in that venue, and  were therefore shocked when the first reversal occurred: a three-judge panel  found in favor of Rambus in a two to one split decision (the third judge filed  a strong dissent in favor of Infineon).&nbsp; One basis for the panel's  decision was a finding that the JEDEC process was not sufficiently clear to  hold Rambus accountable &ndash; even though the opinion also acknowledged that Rambus  found the JEDEC policy clear enough to conclude that it was violating those  same rules at the time.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Infineon then appealed the decision to the whole bench of the  Federal Circuit.&nbsp; A number of &quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs were  filed in support of Infineon.&nbsp; But the  full court declined to re-hear the case.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  Infineon next sought review by the US Supreme Court, and again  supporting briefs were filed on behalf of standard setting organizations,  industry participants, and others.&nbsp; Many  State Attorneys General also wrote and filed their own brief as well.&nbsp; But  the Supreme Court, which accepts only a very small percentage of all cases that  seek their attention,&nbsp;also declined to hear the case.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Then the next reversal occurred: the Federal Circuit had remanded  the case (i.e., sent it&nbsp;back) to Judge Payne, the Virginia Federal Court  judge who had originally found in favor of Infineon&nbsp;&ndash; and Judge Payne  proceeded to&nbsp;throw the case out of court, citing Rambus's document  destruction, and leaving Rambus with no choice but to either begin the appeal  process all over again, or to settle with Infineon.&nbsp; Rambus chose to cut  its losses at this point and entered into a settlement with Infineon that was  widely viewed by its stockholders as a disappointment: Infineon would pay its  damages over time, and would receive favorable licensing terms on other Rambus  technology.&nbsp; However, there were three more defendants to which Rambus  could now turn its now undivided attention, which it proceeded to do.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Rambus was by this time also asserting additional&nbsp;claims  against these vendors in addition to those relating to their refusal to pay  royalties.&nbsp; In these new claims, Rambus  alleged that the four vendors had entered into a price fixing scheme against  Rambus relating to the same patented technology.&nbsp; The antitrust regulators  then brought a suit against the vendors, eventually extracting some of the  largest antitrust penalties ever collected in connection with the settlements  agreed to by these companies.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  In the third major litigation thread, the FTC brought an  investigation against Rambus in June of 2002 in connection with Rambus's  behavior in JEDEC.&nbsp; As noted above, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)  found in Rambus's favor on every count in February of 2004.&nbsp; Like the Federal Circuit judges, the ALJ  based his opinion in part on what he found to be defects in the JEDEC process.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The FTC complaint counsel appealed that decision to the  Commissioners of the FTC, and once again supporting briefs were filed.&nbsp; The Commissioners both heard testimony as  well as reviewed the&nbsp;complete trial record of the earlier trial, and as  further disclosures were made in the concurrent private litigation, delayed  issuing an opinion to permit further investigation.&nbsp; Close to two years  elapsed, until the release of the Commission's opinion in August.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Certainly, the Rambus disputes represent one of the most  convoluted and contradictory cases of standards-related litigation in recent  technology history.&nbsp; In effect, it is as if two separate bands of  criminals arrived at the same time, to rob the same bank, with each thinking  that they had successfully raided the vault.&nbsp; Only later, when each side  began suing the other, and when each was charged by antitrust regulators in  turn, did each side learn that it was as much a victim as a victor.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Over the course of these events, Rambus became a day trader's  darling, as its stock experienced huge swings over the years, depending on its  fortunes in court (Rambus sells no products &ndash; it only develops and licenses  technology). The situation in many ways was similar to the contemporaneous  claims made by SCO, also a small company, in the Linux market, where SCO  continues to assert claims (unsuccessfully) against IBM and others, resulting  in active speculation in SCO's stock.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, one quarter of  Rambus's market capitalization disappeared on the day that the FTC announced  its decision.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Of course, the saga is still not complete.&nbsp; In Rambus's suit against Hynix, the judge  has stayed further action, pending the results of the FTC's decisions on  penalties.&nbsp; Meanwhile, multiple class  action suits have been filed against Rambus, seeking damages for the  incremental increase in SDRAM prices over the past many years during which some  vendors were passing along Rambus royalties to their customers.&nbsp; And Rambus will be waiting to see what penalties  the FTC decides to impose, before deciding whether to appeal or settle &ndash; a  decision complicated by the effect that one decision or another will have on  the hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties that it may (or may not)  receive as a result in relation to its suits and settlements with the four  semiconductor vendors.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  For now, the standard setting world may feel more secure, knowing  that the FTC has supported the standard setting process, sending a clear  message to the industry that the antitrust regulators will punish those that  take actions intended to manipulate that process in pursuit of anticompetitive  goals.</p>

                <p class="style2"><em>The following are excerpts from the FTC's announcement of its  decision.</em> </p>
                <p align="center" class="style2"><strong>FTC  Finds Rambus Unlawfully Obtained Monopoly Power</strong> <br>
                                  <strong><em>Deceptive Conduct Fostered  &quot;Hold-Up&quot; of Computer Memory Industry</em></strong> </p>
                <p class="style2">                  By a unanimous vote, the Federal Trade  Commission has determined that computer technology developer Rambus, Inc.  unlawfully monopolized the markets for four computer memory technologies that  have been incorporated into industry standards for dynamic random access memory  - DRAM chips. DRAMs are widely used in personal computers, servers, printers,  and cameras. </p>
                <p class="style2">                  In an opinion by Commissioner Pamela  Jones Harbour, the Commission found that, through a course of deceptive  conduct, Rambus was able to distort a critical standard-setting process and  engage in an anticompetitive &quot;hold up&quot; of the computer memory  industry. The Commission held that Rambus's acts of deception constituted  exclusionary conduct under Section 2 of the Sherman Act and contributed significantly  to Rambus's acquisition of monopoly power in the four relevant markets. The  Commission has ordered additional briefings to determine the appropriate remedy  for &quot;the substantial competitive harm that Rambus's course of deceptive  conduct has inflicted.&quot;&hellip;</p>
                <p class="style2">&quot;We find that Rambus's course of  conduct constituted deception under Section 5 of the FTC Act. Rambus's conduct  was calculated to mislead JEDEC members by fostering the belief that Rambus  neither had, nor was seeking, relevant patents that would be enforced against  JEDEC-compliant products. . . . Under the circumstances, JEDEC members acted  reasonably when they relied on Rambus's actions and omissions and adopted the  SDRAM and DDR SDRAM standards.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">&quot;Rambus withheld information that  would have been highly material to the standard-setting process within  JEDEC,&quot; the opinion continues. &quot;JEDEC expressly sought information  about patents to enable its members to make informed decisions about which  technologies to adopt, and JEDEC members viewed early knowledge of potential  patent consequences as vital for avoiding patent hold-up. Rambus understood  that knowledge of its evolving patent position would be material to JEDEC's  choices, and avoided disclosure for that very reason.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">&quot;Through its successful strategy,  Rambus was able to conceal its patents and patent applications until after the  standards were adopted and the market was locked in,&quot; states the opinion.  &quot;Only then did Rambus reveal its patents - through patent infringement  lawsuits against JEDEC members who practiced the standard.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Analyzing Rambus's conduct under the  standards of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the Commission found that  &quot;Rambus engaged in exclusionary conduct that significantly contributed to  its acquisition of monopoly power in four related markets. By hiding the  potential that Rambus would be able to impose royalty obligations of its own  choosing, and by silently using JEDEC to assemble a patent portfolio to cover  the SDRAM and DDR SDRAM standards, Rambus's conduct significantly contributed  to JEDEC's choice of Rambus's technologies for incorporation in the JEDEC DRAM  standards and to JEDEC's failure to secure assurances regarding future royalty  rates - which, in turn, significantly contributed to Rambus's acquisition of  monopoly power.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">&quot;Rambus claims that the superiority  of its patented technologies was responsible for their inclusion in JEDEC's  DRAM standards,&quot; the opinion states. &quot;These claims are not  established by the record. Nor does the record support Rambus's argument that,  even after two JEDEC standards were adopted and substantial switching costs had  accrued, JEDEC and its participants were not locked into the standards. Rambus  now claims that we can and should blind ourselves to the link between its  conduct and JEDEC's adoption of the SDRAM and DDR SDRAM standards, as well as  to the link between JEDEC's standard-setting process and Rambus's acquisition  of monopoly power. These claims fail, both as a matter of fact and as a matter  of law. To hold otherwise would be to allow Rambus to exercise monopoly power  gained through exclusionary conduct. We cannot abide that result, given the  substantial competitive harm that Rambus's course of deceptive conduct has  inflicted.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">&quot;Questions remain regarding how the  Commission can best determine the appropriate remedy,&quot; the opinion states.  &quot;Now that the Commission has found, and determined the scope of liability,  the Commission believes it would exercise its broad remedial powers most  responsibly after additional briefings and, if necessary, oral argument devoted  specifically to remedial issues.&quot; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  In a separate concurring statement,  Commissioner Jon Leibowitz wrote, &quot;Rambus's abuse of JEDEC's  standard-setting process was intentional, inappropriate, and injurious to  competition and consumers alike.&quot; He adds that Rambus's conduct not only  ran afoul of the antitrust laws, but also constitutes an unfair method of  competition in violation of the broader reach of the FTC Act. </p>
                <p class="style2">                  The Commission vote to issue the opinion  and order was 5-0&hellip;.</p>

              <p class="style2">If innovation were a footrace, would it be viewed as a  marathon, a relay, or a sprint? <br>
                <br>
                Business icons, experts and scholars from Bill Gates to  Thomas Friedman are questioning whether the U.S. is positioned today to compete  successfully on the global scene tomorrow. How is innovation affecting national  health and safety, the acceleration of emerging technologies, or development of  trade strategies? What is the impact of innovation on organizations that are  engaged in standards setting and conformity assessment activities? <br>
                <br>
                The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) will  present an examination of these questions during the 2006 ANSI Annual  Conference: Standardization and Innovation, on Wednesday, October 11, at the  Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC. Speakers  and panelists from government, business, industry and academia will describe  the impact of innovation on business planning and global trade. Case studies  will highlight how the future is being changed in business and trade practices,  healthcare, nanotechnology and more. <br>
