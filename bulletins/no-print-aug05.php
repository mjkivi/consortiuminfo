                <p align="left" class="style2">In this issue I highlight the interdependencies of two systems that have much in common, but too often work in total isolation (at least in the United States): government and standard setting organizations (SSO's). Europe and China, among others, see standard setting as an extension of regional and national policy, and integrate these two systems closely, to national advantage. I believe that the United States government, SSO's and industry should recognize the value of greater collaboration as well, and work towards optimizing the relationship between these two allied, but too-often independent systems. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In this month&rsquo;s Editorial, I note that the interconnections between government and SSO's will increase, as will the margin between success and failure in remaining competitive in the global marketplace. As a result, I call for more cooperation and dialogue between government and SSO's in the United States. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In the Feature Article, I examine the ways in which government and SSO's are the same, and in which ways they are different, and offer suggestions on how the two can better work together for greater mutual benefit, and greater benefit to the end user. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In this month&rsquo;s excerpt from the Standards Blog I depart briefly from this issue&rsquo;s theme, and describe how one mechanism for simplifying intellectual property matters &ndash; the patent pool &ndash; can be used to favorable effect in the software arena as well. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In this month&rsquo;s excerpt from Consider This&hellip; I explore the relationship between standards (in this case definitions) and legislation by comparing the many popular definitions of &ldquo;Wilderness&rdquo; to that which was included in the 1964 Wilderness Act. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> I also have two announcements to make this month. In the first, I take pleasure in announcing that we have helped plan, and are co-sponsoring a seminar in Washington, D.C. on October 5, in conjunction with World Standards Week and the ANSI Annual Conference. The seminar will analyze the impact that the close coordination between government and SSO's in Europe and China is having on their national competitiveness, the specific areas in which that impact is being felt, and what can be expected in the future. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> I also take personal pleasure in announcing that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) will be bestowing their 2005 President&rsquo;s Award for Journalism on me in recognition of the role that ConsortiumInfo.org and the Consortium Standards Bulletin have played in helping &ldquo;to raise the profile of standards and highlight their importance to commerce and daily life, as well as encourage greater support for their use and development.&rdquo; </p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style2">While standards are important tools, it is worth recalling that they coexist with another rule set that is in many ways similar, but which is created through a different process. That other set of rules, of course, comprises the many sets of local, state and federal laws and regulations that govern our lives. </span></p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> When setting standards (or drafting legislation) in the breach, it is all too easy to forget about the other system of rules and skills. But the interconnections between these two systems (as explored in greater detail in this month&rsquo;s <a href="#feature">Feature Article </a>) are many, such as the incorporation of consensus standards into regulations (such as building codes). </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> By keeping this big picture in focus, it is easier to understand the often related roles that standards, laws and regulations play in the grand scheme of things, and therefore to do a better job of creating them. It can also enable the creation of more sophisticated and predictable business strategies. Similarly, by recognizing how much is held in common between consensus-based standards and legislated standards, those that create each type of tool may learn from the experiences of those that work in the other system. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> Recognizing that voluntary and mandatory standards have much in common, and that they often serve the same ultimate goals, will be increasingly important in the future, as technology assumes an ever greater role in just about everything. If there is too little communication between those that set governmental policy and those that set standards, each is likely to work at cross purposes rather than towards achieving common goals. In today&rsquo;s highly competitive global marketplace, those nations that maintain the closest ties and achieve the greatest synergies between public and private standards efforts will doubtless gain a meaningful competitive advantage. Most knowledgeable sources would conclude, we believe, that the United States does not enjoy such an advantage today. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> Traditionally, standards and government policy have intersected most often in areas such as trade (where nominally mechanistic standards can be used to favor local industry), procurement (where both government-unique and consensus standards may be used together), and health and public safety (where all manner of standards exist, some of which are created within one system, and some within the other). But now new intersections (or collisions, depending on your point of view) are emerging. For example, Internet governance has become a major focus of the ongoing World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which has created a Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) to consider what action, if any, should be requested in light of the United States&rsquo; continuing oversight of ICANN, which controls the global Internet root directory. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> In fact, both governments as well as the standards bodies that maintain the standards, registries and protocols that enable the Internet to operate all wish to have an efficient, effective system. But each has separate concerns as well. Those that set Internet and Web standards have a technical focus and strong vendor involvement, while those that are concerned with Internet &ldquo;governance&rdquo; worry over who controls this essential resource, especially if it is another government. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> And what of the end-user? On the standards body side, those that have technical expertise may participate in organizations such as the IETF, but someone who simply wants to use the Internet (and whose life is increasingly dependent upon how it operates) has no effective voice at all. In the WSIS process, the interests of the end-user (and particularly those in the Third World) are at the forefront, but the agendas of some participants may also include other goals that are not as admirable. And, as the transitory WSIS process demonstrates, there is currently no effective, standing, trusted system in place to permit both sides to discuss and agree on how to achieve the best results for humanity as a whole when standards and public policy intersect on a global basis. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> Nor is this an isolated example. With increasing globalization, environmental pressures and international tensions, it will be particularly important for each person that plays a role in setting the rules and creating the tools that will control and enable our lives to understand how the pieces fit together. What, for example, will we agree that concepts such as &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; mean, and who will create the laws, regulations and standards that will allow us to define, measure and achieve that goal on a case-by-case basis? Will there be communication among those that set policy and those that create standards, and how will that be achieved? </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"> If we are to live in the type of world that we would wish, greater identification of the role of standards, and the interplay of laws and standards, will be important &ndash; as will greater understanding on the part of those that work in each system about the work and goals of the other. Perhaps greater compromises will be needed by each system in order to achieve the best results. Focusing greater attention on how this dual system can be optimized, and setting up well thought out channels for regular dialogue today will doubtless make creating the world that we hope to live in tomorrow more achievable. </p>

              <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style71">Introduction:</span></em></strong> <span class="style2">When we think of a standard, we typically think in terms of the specific purpose for which that standard was created: the performance required by a product, the requirements needed to establish interoperability between two devices, and so on. In a sense, standards are examples of &ldquo;Thou shalt&rdquo; requirements. </span></p>
              <p class="style2"> When we think of laws and regulations, we typically think in terms of rules that specify what cannot be done (e.g., trespassing), or the limits within which things may be done (e.g., speed limits). In other words, laws and regulations usually constitute &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; rules. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Of course, the dividing line between these two types of standards, one of which relies upon the power of the state, and the other of which is consensual, is hardly so simple, and one need not look too far to begin to find areas where the two types of rules begin to intersect. For example, laws and regulations are frequently created to protect public health, safety and welfare. But many non-governmental standards are created for the same purpose. And, indeed, local, state and national governments frequently incorporate standards created through the consensus process into their own laws and regulations (e.g., the repurposing of electrical and construction standards into building codes). Similarly, governments are huge purchasers of goods and services, and until recently, &ldquo;government unique&rdquo; standards were the norm in the United States rather than the exception in the procurement process. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The concerns that motivate legislators and regulators, on the one hand, and standards development organizations (SDO's) and consortia <a href="#1">1</a> (referred to collectively below in this article as &ldquo;standard setting organizations&rdquo;, or &ldquo;SSO's&rdquo;), on the other hand, are in many ways similar. But they are also in many ways dissimilar, as are the processes by which they are created. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Besides overlaps in subject matter and the incorporation of standards into laws and regulations, there are other intersections between these two spheres as well. For example, two of the global &ldquo;Big I&rsquo;s&rdquo; (the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and the International Electrotechnical Commission, or IEC) are private organizations in which there is national participation. But the third Big I (the International Telecommunication Union, or ITU) became a special agency of the United Nations in 1947. Consequently, while vendors and others may also participate as members, countries participate in the ITU as member states at the governmental level. Within individual countries, SSO's may be highly distributed and include government agencies only as individual members (as in the United States), or the standards function may be carried out entirely by government agencies, or by government-chartered organizations (e.g., DIN, the German Institute for Standardization). </p>
              <p class="style2"> The number of other interrelations is legion (e.g., the World Trade Organization&rsquo;s rules prohibiting the use of standards to erect barriers to trade, and the various regional European standards agencies created under the governmental authority of the EU itself). These interrelations could be the subject of an extremely lengthy article in their own right. </p>
              <p class="style2"> There are thus not only distinct roles played by both governments and SSO's, but also extensive interconnections and interdependencies between these two sources of the rules that govern our behavior, environment, products, health, safety and virtually every other aspect of our lives. Acquiring an understanding of the ways in which these two standard systems are different, as well as the characteristics, dynamics and goals that they have in common, can therefore be useful in charting how the most useful outcomes for society may be achieved through both approaches working in cooperation. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Since many specific needs can as effectively be addressed through either the legislative or the consensus process, it is also important to appreciate which venue would be most appropriate in a given circumstance, so that the governments know when to act, and when to defer, to the private sector. Similarly, since legislative resources are limited, it is important to be able to demonstrate why public resources should be allocated to a given purpose that ostensibly could be addressed through a private sector response. Finally, where both systems must work in tandem, it is important to understand the unique abilities (and weaknesses) of each in order to make the most effective and efficient use of the resources of each, and to ensure that the efforts of one are not wasted due to the unwillingness of the other to become involved in a supporting role. </p>
              <p class="style2"> The purpose of this article is not to present a comprehensive treatment of this subject (which would require a work of far greater length), but to selectively highlight some of the aspects of this symbiotic relationship in order to raise awareness and to encourage greater dialogue and collaboration between those that operate in these two separate but necessarily related systems. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Areas (and degrees) of commonality:</em></strong> Both governments and SSO's share many goals, concerns, and areas of focus. But in most or all of these instances, there are also important distinctions that arise as a result of the process that each system employs, the backgrounds of those that make the decisions, the constituencies that they represent, and the motivations that bring them to pursue their individual goals. These areas of commonality, and the relevant distinctions between them, include the following: </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em> Subject Matter (e.g., Health and safety):</em></strong> </em></strong>Protecting the lives and promoting the health of the citizenry is one of the acknowledged roles of government in the modern world. In the United States, this became increasingly true over the last 100 years, and a vast network of laws and supporting regulations and enforcement agencies have been created in areas such as workplace safety (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA), food and drug efficacy, safety and purity (the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA) and pollution abatement and remediation (the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA). </p>
              <p class="style2"> But many of these same concerns have been addressed by private industry, although the motivations that bring private companies together for that purpose may be rather different. For example, industries can attract government regulation if they are not considered to be sufficiently safe and responsible, and industry therefore often acts out of self-interest in setting the rules by which it will operate. Similarly, before insurance coverage can be obtained for a new industry, standards are often needed in order to provide insurance providers with the level of certainty upon which actuarial calculations can be based. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Finally, the advent of consumer product safety laws and regulations and the judicial development of the concept of imposing strict liability for injury upon everyone in the distribution chain, from manufacturer to point of sale, has engendered strong economic reasons for manufacturers to build safe products, and for those downstream to carry products that are certified to be safe. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong> <strong><em> Representative nature:</em></strong> </em></strong>In a free society, anyone may vote, and anyone (subject to elementary requirements, such as citizenship and age) may run for elected office, allowing all voices to be heard -- at least theoretically. Typically, regional interests are also typically represented. Thus, although each party tries as hard as it can to play the system to its maximum advantage, a well-conceived government system will permit all interests to be heard, if not ultimately satisfied. </p>
              <p class="style2"> By definition, SDO's must be open to all who wish to participate, although those that do in fact choose to become involved may not be representative of all that have a stake in the final work product that an SDO may produce (consumers being the perennial example, due to lack of interest on their part). In the case of consortia, there is a greater propensity to structure membership classes to accommodate those that are expected to have an interest (e.g., vendors, government, academia, and commercial end-users), although there is frequently an inexpensive informational membership class available to individuals. Consortia also typically require higher membership fees than do SDO's from those that wish to have the greatest influence on the work product of the organization, since consortia garner almost 100% of their operating budget from membership dues, rather than from the sale of their standards. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Even though these differences between governments and SSO's are nominally significant, the results tend to be more similar than might otherwise be expected. This is due in large part to the fact that while governments may require compliance with law, the implementation of standards is voluntary. Hence, if a standard is not created by a representative group, it will be difficult to educate and inspire non-participants to adopt it, and if the SSO has not been successful in attracting a representative group of members, it is more likely that their work product will lack important features that are needed to ensure its final success in the marketplace. As a result, SSO's are well motivated to recruit a representative group of members as a way of achieving their ultimate goals, and to be mindful of the requirements of non-participants, if their adoption of resulting standards is crucial to success.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Process: </em></strong> Process is as important to the success of a law or standard as is the representative nature of the body that creates it. In order to have lasting utility, both laws and standards must be created through a process that is viewed by those that will be affected by the results to be fair, transparent and consistent. Where this is not true, the effort ultimately often fails, either eventually (in the case of laws, which can be repealed by future legislative sessions, or overturned in the courts) or immediately (as occurs in the case of voluntary standards, which may simply not be adopted at all. </p>
              <p class="style2"> At the same time, each system has its own shortcomings. In a legislature, the majority ultimately rules, and therefore even a nominally representative legislature can pass a law that favors one group at the expense of another, or even oppresses one group for the satisfaction or bias of the other. Still, governments act under the harsh light of public scrutiny, which tends to be a moderating factor (at least in a free society), and a well-constructed government will have checks and balances that help to restrict abuse by any single governmental body. </p>
              <p class="style2"> In SSO's, the situation is far different, although the result will generally be the same, through different dynamics. Most obviously, SSO's strive for consensus, since a standard that is not adopted even by its members is not likely to benefit those that carry a vote. As with attracting a representative membership, SSO's also need to employ a process that persuades would-be implementers (members and non-members alike) that they will be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and better off implementing a standard than pursuing a proprietary alternative. If one member believes that another member is able to cheat successfully, then it will conclude that it is better off cheating as well, or perhaps ceasing to participate at all. In either case, the standard (and the SSO) is likely to ultimately fail. In order to avoid that result, a well-constructed and well-administered process is crucial. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Transparency:</em></strong> Both SSO's and governments derive a good measure of their legitimacy and influence from the degree of trust that inspire in the eyes of those that are impacted by their actions. A key element in earning such trust in each system is by maintaining transparency in process and actions, as well as by accepting and considering public comments on work product that is in draft form. </p>
              <p class="style2"> In the case of SSO's, practice varies, with some operating entirely in full public view, and others limiting access to standards in process throughout part of the process as a privilege of membership (and an incentive to pay membership fees). At some point, however, an SSO will typically post a draft for public comment, and then consider all comments received to whatever extent it&rsquo;s rules provide. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Government operates under a much more formal process, with extensive rules regulating what must be where, when and how; what discussions will be held in open session; how and when transcripts are created and how they will be made available; how proposed regulations will be posted for comment and where, and so on. This legislative and regulatory record is not only relied upon as the process continues, but may be consulted later (and cited in court) to indicate what was the legislative intent where ambiguity is later found to exist. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Game Playing : </em></strong> Even when attention is paid to designing and administering a process that minimizes opportunities for abuse, both systems are sadly subject to game playing of various types. Procedurally, government has more mechanisms (both formal and informal) to facilitate such activity than do most SSO's, such as the ability to add unrelated &ldquo;riders&rdquo; to legislation in order to secure often wasteful appropriations for the home districts of individual senators and congressman. On the other hand, there are various forms of formal oversight over both the legislative and the rule making processes, as well as a broad and attentive public press. </p>
              <p class="style2"> The game playing within some SSO's (SDO's as well as consortia) can also become intense, including actions taken to ensure that a finally approved standard will require the payment of a royalty to a participant, either for implementing a standard, or for making practical use of a standard through the need to practice additional patented inventions. Such abuses of process may incur the ire of those directly involved, but rarely achieve wide attention or detailed reporting in the technical press, unless actual litigation ensues (as in the case of <em>Rambus v. Infineon</em>) or if the stakes are very high (as in the case of the Eolas patent cited against some aspects of the Microsoft Explorer browser). </p>
              <p align="left"> <span class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong> <strong><em> Necessity of Compromise</em></strong>:</em></strong> Both the legislative process and the SSO consensus process often rely on compromises among those involved. In the case of government, the need for compromise can be absolute, where a law must be passed, or relative, where action (such as an Executive Order) does not require formal legislative approval, but the party in power&rsquo;s fortunes at the polls may suffer in the future, or when &ldquo;pay back&rdquo; on the floor of Congress on other initiatives may result from overplaying one&rsquo;s hand. </span></p>
              <p class="style2"> In the world of SSO's, the need for consensus is either formal (as in the SDO's&rsquo; and consortia whose rules require it) or practical, as in those consortia that do not have such a formal rule, but operate in that fashion nonetheless in order to secure broad member adoption of the standards that the SSO develops. </p>
              <p class="style2"> But the distinctions between the two systems are also marked. There may be less horse-trading in many SSO's, and truly unrelated riders on standards are unknown. Similarly, most of those individuals that actually participate in SDO's (and virtually all of those that participate in consortia) do so as a function of a job that they already have. As a result, in contrast to the political system, how one votes in an SSO is unlikely to have any impact on one&rsquo;s future livelihood (assuming that a vote is cast in a manner consistent with critical aspects of the business strategy of one&rsquo;s business strategy). </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em> Areas of difference: </em></strong> While various qualified differences have already been described, there are additional ways in which governments and SSO's are totally different, or nearly so. These include the following: </p>
              <div align="left"><span class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mode of representation</em></strong>: </em></strong>To use classic terminology, democratic countries (such as the United States, France and Canada) are republics, while SSO's are Athenian democracies. What this means is that while the power of government derives from the governed in each case, that power is exercised by elected officials and representatives, and it is these individuals that create policy and vote on outcomes. In SSO's, this intermediate layer is eliminated at the technical voting level. Instead, those that have a stake in an outcome and sufficient interest in affecting it are free (as were the citizens of Athens) to become directly involved in determining outcomes. 
                </span>
                <p class="style2"> What the two systems share in common is that the success of an SSO is typically affected by its success in recruitment. If a sufficiently large and diverse membership is secured, then those that are directly involved tend to act as effective proxies for those that are not. Still, there is an important difference: being representative of an interest group as a factual matter is far different from being responsible to that group in an electoral sense, and outcomes may therefore be less predictable. </p>
                <p class="style2"> SSO outcomes may also be less broadly representative, since a representative in each system may be expected to act out of self-interest. In the governmental setting, that self-interest is reelection (a product of being responsible to her electors), while a representative in an SSO will act solely out of her employer&rsquo;s best interests, which may (or may not), for a variety of reasons, be representative of all other companies similarly situated. What saves the system in the case of an SSO is that the goal is wide adoption of the standard, and therefore the self-interest of the member, and the self-interest of non-involved stakeholders is often sufficiently aligned to produce the right result. </p>
                <p class="style2"> The great weakness in each system is not that too many players play to &ldquo;win&rdquo;, but that too many players believe that winning means achieving their desired specific outcome, rather than an outcome that is most beneficial to all (in the case of governments) or most likely to be broadly adopted (in the case of SSO's). </p>
              </div>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Constituencies:</em></strong> Although SDO's are supposed to keep the interests of all stakeholders (involved and uninvolved alike) in mind &ndash; and many make a genuine effort to do so, as do a few consortia (such as the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C) -- there is a broad gap between the governmental and SSO systems in this regard. Even with the best of intentions, it is hard to work actively in the interests of a group that has not chosen to participate. More seriously, under-representation of specific groups can occur by design (e.g., if recruiting efforts or fee structures are targeted at certain groups to the exclusion of others) or through negligence or lack of resources (e.g., for a consortium, when recruiting efforts beyond the national borders of the host country are weak). </p>
              <span class="style2">The innate differences between the two systems that can lead to variations in serving all stakeholders are too numerous to mention, but would include the following: SSO's have limited recruiting budgets, and only the barest semblance of a Bill or Rights or Constitution that institutionalizes the rights of the individual or any specific interest group against the work of the SSO. At the same time, however, SSO's are more open than governments to direct participation by anyone that chooses to do so, <a href="#2">2</a> while a small interest group in a governmental system may find it almost impossible to be effectively heard.

              </span>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Priority:</em></strong> One of the prime reasons that a given need is addressed within one system or the other is the priority that is placed upon that need by the participants in each potential venue. Thus, where a subject area is identified closely with a government&rsquo;s mission (e.g., health, safety, and creating public infrastructure), governments are likely to become involved, and even preempt the field (as in setting and allocating the telecommunications frequencies that are utilized by standards set by SSO's such as the IEEE). But government has many concerns to address, and its attention to setting standards (by law and regulation) is therefore severely limited. <a href="#2">3</a> Where a given need is relevant to only a small sector of society or industry, there must be a compelling reason why government should become involved. </p>
              <span class="style2">The result is that, areas of overlap and intersection aside, there are relatively clear lines that separate where government takes the leading role and where it is content to be a follower. How this occurs on a nation by nation basis varies widely, with some countries (such as China) and regions (such as Europe) taking an active governmental interest, while others (such as the United States) play a very limited and episodic supporting role. <a href="#4">4</a> </span>              <p align="left" class="style2">The boundary between government and SSO's is not only one that is blurred, but also one that can be moved by circumstances and events. For example, in the area of professional or safety standards, when a scandal or tragedy leads to the public perception that private industry is doing an inadequate job of policing itself, government may be forced by public opinion to step in, either effectively, or (as in the case of the CANSPAM legislation) ineffectively. Similarly, the importance or strategic value of standards in a given area may rise, leading government to assign a higher priority to an area going forward (the WSIS initiative to explore Internet &ldquo;governance&rdquo; issues is one such example). </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong>Knowledge:</em></strong> Government is often at a distinct disadvantage to SSO's in many situations where standards need to be created by law or regulation. In some cases, large and knowledgeable government agencies already exist, with deep domain expertise (as in the case of securities regulation). But in others, as often is the case of trade policy when the United States is called upon by industry to assert U.S. rights and interests as a member of the World Trade Organization, it may find that it needs to turn to outside experts for education on arcane technical matters. </p>
              <p class="style2"> One result of this reality is the rise of the lobbyist: the professional that is paid to gain access to and &ldquo;educate&rdquo; influential legislators, but whose employer has an interest in advocating a particular result. When government makes too much use of lobbyists and expends too little effort on independent fact finding and contacting of disinterested experts, results suffer. SSO's provide one source of information for Congress that is representative of the views of industry broadly, rather than the self-interested advice of a single company with a large lobbying budget. </p>
              <p class="style2"> In contrast, the work of SSO's is typically staffed (at the technical level) with both dedicated and volunteer staff that are very knowledgeable, and that can therefore accurately understand both the need as well as craft an appropriate solution. On the other hand, SDO's are variously knowledgeable and able to support efforts (and consortia are typically clueless and inadequately funded) to influence or educate governments in order to advocate pursuing international standards-based strategies. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong> <strong><em> Unique capabilities</em></strong>:</em></strong> While SSO's can create standards, they have only limited abilities to persuade non-members to adopt them. This is, for the most part, a good thing, as it forces SSO's to offer quality and openness as incentives to adoption. Still, when international crises arise (as when China last year sought to require usage of a domestic wireless standard rather than the IEEE &ldquo;Wi-Fi&rdquo; standard) a government possesses powers of persuasion that no mere SSO can command. Similarly, although the CANSPAM law that was intended to abate the nuisance of junk email was structurally flawed from the outset, it is also likely that an effective response to spam, phishing and other abuses will ultimately only be achieved through coordinated international effort at the governmental level. </p>
              <p class="style2"> While governments mandate compliance with their laws, SSO's, for their part, can (at least at times) achieve broad industry buy-in, resulting in faster and more enthusiastic uptake of standards than might occur if the same requirements were established via the regulatory process. Also, the SSO process, while appearing slow to those that wish for instant gratification, is almost always more rapid than the tedious legislative process. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em> Strengths and weaknesses:</em></strong> Clearly, there are meaningful differences between the legislative and the consensus standards process. On a composite basis, some of the most notable may be summarized as follows: </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governmental</em>:</strong> Laws and regulations are backed by the power of the state, meaning that uptake is generally assured, so long as enforcement is practical and government has the determination to put its resources behind assuring compliance. Governments also have domestic and international credibility and powers that SSO's do not, as well as rigidly transparent (and scrutinized) processes. Hence, the government venue is optimized for situations where: compliance cannot otherwise be assumed without the ability to levy penalties; the stakes are very high; compliance testing is expensive or burdensome; transparent, documented process is crucial; and/or international cooperation is required and not likely to automatically occur out of self-interest. However, the government process has a price: the legislative agenda is crowded, the process is slow, the outcome is unpredictable, and the costs of enforcement are great. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>SSO's:</em></strong> Relative to government, SDO's in general, and consortia in particular, are very light-weight and inexpensive affairs. While the fully burdened cost of producing a single standard (when member travel and time costs are included) is still substantial, it is rapidly decreasing, as standard setting increasingly becomes an on-line activity. The relevance of any individual standard created by an SSO is also likely to be far narrower than many matters typically addressed by a legislature. SSO's by their nature are therefore optimized for achieving relatively fast, cheap results that are of importance to specific interest groups (and that will not adversely impact other interest groups). While there can be needless duplication of effort between SSO's, there can also be concurrent beta testing of multiple new ideas and approaches in competing organizations, with the marketplace ultimately deciding which approach is preferable for what purpose (a luxury that the governmental process is not constructed to allow). <a href="#5">5</a> </p>
              
              <p align="left" class="style2">SSO's also have the signal advantage of relying on consensus rather than the brute force of an &ldquo;up or down&rdquo; legislative vote. When the process works poorly, the result is a watered down, ineffective, ignored standard (which is still better than a watered down, ineffective &ndash; but nevertheless enforced &ndash; regulation). When the process works well, however, broad and rapid adoption follows. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong><em>Lessons to be learned: </em></strong> Neither process is ideal, and each system could productively borrow specific strategies and features from the other, as well as work with the other on a more advantageous basis. Here are some examples of such possibilities, based upon the observations made in this article: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> SSO's are typically far more successful at achieving voluntary, global buy-in than has been (for example) the United Nations in many cases. Similarly, the process of creating a standard is often more smooth and constructive than is the often adversarial process of constructing and passing legislation. Perhaps national governments and international treaty organizations could productively examine the consensus process to learn how to improve the success and speed of their own efforts. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> The most significant difference between SSO's, on the one hand, and governments and treaty organizations, on the other, is that the SSO process is based on creating standards that the members will <em>want</em> to implement, as compared to the political process, in which legislators and diplomats ultimately come up with a compromise that the legislators or treaty parties ultimately <em>agree</em> to respect. The result is that standards become adopted on their own merit, while laws and treaty obligations must be policed, and sometimes enforced. While certainly not all actions considered by governments are susceptible to consensus approval (that, after all, is one reason that we have governments), this does not mean that identifying those situations that are appropriate at an early stage would not be productive. The distinction to be made is that the SSO process assumes the need for consensus, while the legislative process assumes the need for a majority vote &ndash; and that makes all of the difference. In the United States, for example, the increasingly adversarial, &ldquo;winner take all&rdquo; atmosphere that currently exists in Congress ensures that consensus decisions will all too rarely be achieved. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> Government and industry sectors should maintain the type of closer working relationships that would enable high-level forward planning. By agreeing upon goals, and then establishing guidelines for allocating which tasks can most productively be achieved through the efforts and support of each system, better domestic results, and greater international influence, might be achieved (in this regard, the United States government could learn a great deal from the example presented by Europe). A first step in creating such a system could be to create a working group of representatives of SDO's, consortia, industry experts, and relevant government agencies that could make recommendations for creating such a system. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> Closer collaboration between SSO's and governments could allow government to make more effective and efficient use of SSO work product and knowledge. At the same time, such collaboration could provide SSO's with new avenues to increase uptake of that work product. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> While consortia play an increasingly important role in the United States technology-based economy, there is virtually no communication or collaboration between these hundreds of organizations and the U.S. Congress or agencies, nor any organization to act on their behalf, as does the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) on behalf of SDO's The result is a near-total disconnect between the knowledge and activity base represented by consortia and the U.S. government. Only when individual companies act to bring a consortium standards-based situation to the attention of government does such a link become established. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> Minimal economic support from governments could greatly help in harmonizing SSO and government efforts in order to avoid needless duplication and to speed government awareness of available consensus standards. For example, there is a chronic (and increasing) need for a master registry of standards efforts in process, as well as completed standards and other work product. There is not sufficient will or resources within any existing SSO to create such a comprehensive resource today (although some more limited efforts are in process), but a government grant of modest proportions could easily reverse the situation. </li>
              </ul>              
              <p class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Summary</span>:</em></strong> Governments and SSO's share much in common &ndash; and each has distinct features, strengths and weaknesses not shared in full with the other. While there has always been cooperation and awareness between these two systems, closer study of the dynamics and attributes of each could lead to greater successes and strategies for each system and its stakeholders. Similarly, government agencies and legislative staff and SSO's should take greater interest in maintaining closer, and more collaborative, relationships to their mutual advantage. A first step in achieving a more efficient and productive relationship between government and SSO's in the United States would be to form a working group to study opportunities for change, and to make specific recommendations. </p>
              <span class="style2">As standards become of ever greater societal and strategic importance in the future, the nation that most effectively optimizes the relationship between its legislative, regulatory and consensus based standards efforts will enjoy a competitive advantage in the global marketplace. Those that neglect to do so will suffer accordingly, as the margin for error between successful competition and unsuccessful efforts to remain competitive in the global marketplace becomes ever smaller.</span>              <p align="left" class="style2"><a href="/subscribe/"><img src="/images/subscribe-csb.gif" width="130" height="25" border="0"></a></p>

While the range of organizations that could fall under the general label &ldquo;consortium&rdquo; is broad, ranging from small, closed, self-selecting organizations to large, global associations that are indistinguishable from SDO's, for purposes of this article I define a consortium to be an organization that has all of the commonly accepted attributes of an organization that sets &ldquo;open standards&rdquo; (e.g., membership is available to all, there are clear and fair policies and procedures that are in fact followed, resulting specifications may be implemented by members and non-members alike under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, and so on). There are hundreds of non-accredited organizations that meet this definition today. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><a name="2"></a>2. 


A hopeful recent development in this regard is the decision by the W3C to encourage greater Third World participation through offering reduced membership fees to representatives of poorer nations.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><a name="3"></a>3.  It is in large part for this very reason that the thousands of SSO's that are in existence today originally came into being. With the advent of the modern industrial age, someone needed to decide how far apart the railroad rails would be, and how close together the screw threads. The eventual result was the creation of the modern, global consensus-based standards system. Luckily, the effort was a success, which explains why government and SSO's have evolved such a successful and symbiotic relationship. </p>

                  An excellent current example of this dynamic is demonstrated by the various wireless standards that have been, are, and doubtless will in the future continue to be proposed by one interest group or another. Some early competing standards have been abandoned (e.g., HomeRF), while others (such as Blue Tooth and Wi-Fi) have become established, but for the separate uses to which each is best suited. Presumably, this is a good result for the end-user, given that the marketplace was able to sort itself out effectively before many devices were purchased, and therefore few end-users were abandoned. </p>

                              <strong><em> </em></strong></p>
              <p> <span class="style2">In times gone by, children in London would trundle scarecrow-like figures in wheelbarrows through the streets on November 5, and beg passersby for &quot;A penny for the Guy?&rdquo; The scarecrow was meant to represent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes"> Guy Fawkes</a>, the ringleader of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, who sought to annihilate both King James I and the British Parliament as well. You wouldn't actually get anything in return for your largesse, but a penny would keep the children happy, and away from worse mischief. </span></p>
              <p class="style2"> Cut to the present. A long-running drama has taken a new and relatively unusual turn that is worth noting. The saga to which I refer is the protracted (and ultimately unsuccessful) struggle waged within EPC Global to maintain a royalty-free environment for RFID standards. And that new turn is the announcement today that a patent pool is being formed by some 20 companies in order to establish royalty rates and manage royalty payments on implementations of EPC Global RFID standards. </p>
              <p class="style2"> The announcement was made in a <a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20050809005368&newsLang=en"> press release</a> with a headline that could win an award for prolixity: &quot;RFID Industry Group Proposes Patent Licensing Consortium; Group Invites RFID Patent Holders to Join; Modeled after MPEG-2 and DVD IP Licensing Programs; Conference Call Scheduled for Today at 12:30 p.m. ET.&quot; [Added Wednesday AM: An <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/10/technology/10tags.html?"> article in the New York Times</a> today contradicts this headline, stating that Intermec Technologies -- which claims that it owns 145 RFID technology patents and is already in litigation involving some of them -- was not asked to join the new group.] </p>
              <p class="style2"> The press release tries to put the best face on the announcement that such a large group of patent owners will be charging a fee for the use of readers, and (more significantly) the billions of RFID tags that a mature industry could be expected to purchase per year. For example, the words &quot;patent pool&quot; are never used in the release (it speaks of the formation of a &quot;patent consortium&quot; instead). Similarly, the release states in part: </p>
              <p class="style2"> This consortium will be modeled after the successful patent licensing consortium formed and implemented around essential technologies in the MPEG-2 and DVD industries. As with those successful models, the RFID consortium is intended to provide a structured approach for holders of essential RFID patents to receive fair compensation for those patents, at a reasonable cost to the end-user, thus promoting rapid adoption of RFID. This approach offers competitive benefits by integrating complementary technologies and reducing transaction costs. It offers an effective alternative to time-consuming and expensive individual licensing agreements. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Is this all just self-serving spin, following on the failure of EPC Global to achieve a royalty free result? The answer will depend on whether you look at the world ideologically or pragmatically. </p>
              <p class="style2"> If you are in the former camp, and especially if you favor the open source model, then this is a great disaster, and the Dark Side has triumphed, because a new technology will be taxed. But let's look at the other side for a moment and see if the future is really all that bleak. </p>
              <p class="style2"> First, let's look at how a patent pool operates, when all owners of relevant patent claims agree to participate. When that happens, the following results can follow: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> The participants decide on what royalty the market can bear without slowing adoption. Let's say that amount is one cent per RFID tag. </li>
                <li class="style2"> The participants then agree on a formula for dividing that one-cent among them. </li>
                <li class="style2"> They also agree on one licensing agreement, and appoint one licensing agent to administer the program. Implementers thus can have &quot;one stop shopping&quot; rather than having to negotiate agreements with multiple vendors. </li>
                <li class="style2"> Because there is a single point of licensing, the terms really are RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory), because there are no one-on-one negotiations and private deals between vendors and implementers. </li>
                <li class="style2"> When other companies are awarded patents, they simply join the pool, and the royalty that implementers are charged doesn't go up. Thus, there are still rewards for continuing innovation, while the price remains unchanged. </li>
                <li class="style2"> Because everyone is on the bus, the patent landscape is cleared, and all of the patent owners have an incentive to get behind the effort. </li>
                <li class="style2"> Most significantly, there is less likelihood of a destructive battle between two competing standards, because everyone can get a piece of the action (possibly on different parts of the technology chain, with one company making their profit on tags, and another on readers), even though there is only one standard. </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"> The result, therefore, can be rapid adoption of inexpensive technology, with no threat of a standards war, but with continuing R&amp;D and ongoing upgrading of the initial architecture. In other words, a new technology can enter the marketplace more quickly, more pervasively, and even more cheaply due to greater volume sales and price competition, and end-users can adopt that new technology with less risk. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Of course, in the best of all possible worlds, patent owners would make their patents available for free to achieve exactly the same result, and content themselves with a vast new market, competing with each other to offer valuable features and superior quality and service. </p>
              <p class="style2"> But we live in a different world, and it's not likely that we'll be able to do anything about that in the near future. For now, maybe a penny a tag for the Guy is a small price to pay to know that you're buying a VHS video player, and not a Betamax. </p>

              <span class="style56">#31</span> <span class="style103"><strong><em>How do you Define a Wilderness? </em></strong></span><span class="style2">There are many different tools that qualify (in my mind, at least) as standards. One of the oldest is the humble definition, a simple device that establishes the exact meaning of a given word so that both the speaker as well as the listener can understand that word in the same way. In its oldest form, a definition was the answer to a child&rsquo;s question &ldquo;What does that word mean?&rdquo; </span></p>
              <p class="style2"> Definitions can be simple and useful tools, or they can be powerful instruments of policy, because he who controls a definition has already won the first battle, and sometimes perhaps the war as well. </p>
              <p class="style2"> For example, consider this: what does (or should) the word &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; mean? </p>
              <p class="style2"> Most of us would likely summon an image like this when hearing that word in a sentence: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> An area of undeveloped land affected primarily by the forces of nature; an area where humans are visitors who do not remain.<br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=3&oi=define&q=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070294267/student_view0/glossary_s-z.html"> highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070294267/student_view0/glossary_s-z.html</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> This is a contemporary definition, however, that reflects a modern appreciation of nature. A thousand years ago, when wolves roamed all over Europe and most people throughout the world lived in isolated communities separated by untamed terrain, wilderness had a far different connotation, and represented a place of fear and danger, rather than a desirable area to be preserved. In times gone by, the word would have been defined as follows: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> Area between cities, whether inhabited or not. Also called the Wilds.<br>
                      <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=17&oi=define&q=http://home.comcast.net/~TheGM/SE/glossary.html"> home.comcast.net/~TheGM/SE/glossary.html</a></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> As I write this, I am on a hiking and camping vacation in Northwestern Nevada, one of the emptiest parts of the United States. In an area 120 by 160 miles, there are only 12 ranches and a 575,000 acre wildlife refuge. Besides the ranch buildings, there is not a home, gas station, or (needless to say) cell phone tower or fast food emporium. In fact, there is not even a paved road, except for state route 140, a two-lane affair that cuts through one corner of the refuge. The land is stark, big and beautiful, with much wild game, no cultivation, and, on any given day, only a handful of people present. The silence is enduring, unmarred even by the sound of a plane. But does that make it wilderness? </p>
              <p class="style2"> The answer depends, of course, on the definition. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Almost all of this land is public, but this public land is also committed to specific uses. The majority is controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which means (in these parts) that each of these acres has been leased to a rancher, in some cases several generations ago. These valuable rights to graze cattle have been handed down from generation to generation. Still, if you visit you will likely drive for many miles without seeing a single steer (they are likely at higher, cooler elevations at this time of year). But don&rsquo;t be deceived: all of the land through which you are traveling has been profoundly altered as a result of over a hundred years of grazing (as has been the case with virtually every other acre of land west of the Mississippi that is not cultivated or part of a city, town or National Park). </p>
              <p class="style2"> Once, this land was covered with grasses and wild flowers that retained and made the most of the fertile earth and the sparse rainfall of the Great Basin, and grew four feet high. Today, as a result of grazing and fire suppression, the land grows primarily what cattle won&rsquo;t eat. Characteristically, that means sagebrush, which periodic fires sparked by summer lightning would ordinarily suppress, and a sparse growth of cheat grass and a few other plants that grow sporadically in between the woody sagebrush bushes, provided that the land is not being over-grazed. Much of the soil has long-since washed away from most non-level areas, and the volcanic rock that forms the underlying geology of most of the state is often plainly visible through the cracks of the parched ground that remains. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Does that mean that this land is therefore undeniably not wilderness? To my surprise, I found a definition that clearly predates our modern usage of the word: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> (1.) Heb. midhbar, denoting not a barren desert but a district or region suitable for pasturing sheep and cattle (Ps. 65:12; Isa. 42:11; Jer. 23:10; Joel 1:19; 2:22); an uncultivated place. This word is used of the wilderness of Beersheba (Gen. 21:14), on the southern border of Palestine; the wilderness of the Red Sea (Ex. 13:18); of Shur (15:22), a portion of the Sinaitic peninsula; of Sin (17:1), Sinai (Lev. 7:38), Moab (Deut. 2:8), Judah (Judg. 1:16), Ziph, Maon, En-gedi (1 Sam. 23:14, 24; 24:1<br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=6&oi=define&q=http://christianity.about.com/library/weekly/blT0003800.htm"> christianity.about.com/library/weekly/blT0003800.htm</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> For some, the argument might begin and end right there. Bring on the cows! </p>
              <p class="style2"> As I drove on a dirt road into this isolated tract, I happened to pass one of the few ranchers that live here, the owner of 20,000 acres of high, rugged mountains and broad and empty valleys. We had quite an interesting conversation and I learned a number of things that are germane to what a wilderness may, or may not be, depending upon your point of view. For one, he&rsquo;s found 16 of his bulls (much more valuable than cows) shot dead and left on the spot so far this year, presumably by ecoterrorists that want the land to return to it&rsquo;s original state. Clearly, their definition would run something like this: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> Land that, together with its plant and animal communities, is in a state that has not been substantially modified by, and is remote from, the influences of European settlement or is capable of being restored to such a state, and is of sufficient size to make its maintenance in such a state feasible.<br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=9&oi=define&q=http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/publications/strategy/gloss.html"> www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/publications/strategy/gloss.html</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> He also told me that he is planning to spray his entire ranch with an herbicide that would kill the sage brush, and that he would then burn the terrain every five years or so to keep the sagebrush from reestablishing itself, so that his ranch could return to grasslands of a more traditional character. He was also enclosing a large area of his land to keep his cattle out, in an effort to encourage it to return completely to its original natural state. Even without such intervention, however, state wildlife officials estimate that his land already supports 75 antelope, 25 mountain sheep and several mountain lions (all animals that tolerate little human interference, and that we associate with wild, isolated, natural habitats), not to mention herds of deer and many other types of wildlife. He also hopes to share his land with more people, inviting them in as visitors. Clearly, to him, &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; (if that is a word he would use at all) would have a more nuanced meaning, perhaps as follows: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> An area of land that has been least modified by modern technological society; the most intact and undisturbed expanses of our remaining natural landscapes. Also see Forest Management Zone.<br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=11&oi=define&q=http://www.forest.nsw.gov.au/education/glossary/default.asp"> www.forest.nsw.gov.au/education/glossary/default.asp</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> When I moved on from his ranch and into the Charles Sheldon Antelope Range, I expected to see a significant difference in vegetation, since the Range has not been grazed by cattle in many decades. To my surprise, there was more, rather than less sagebrush, and as I hiked I often found that the juniper trees that were attempting to re-colonize part of their traditional habitat had been cut down. </p>
              <p class="style2"> I learned the reason for these discoveries from the only person that I met during the several days that I hiked and camped in the wildlife refuge: a fire marshal who I found parked with his rig and crew on a cliff overlooking a wide valley of the Range, pre-positioned over the area that an approaching thunderstorm was most likely to ignite with its lightning strikes. He told me that sagebrush provides excellent cover for sage grouse, deer and antelope (he was right &ndash; I repeatedly flushed deer and grouse as I hiked), and that the Range was being managed to maximize game production for hunters. As a result, the fires that would normally help maintain the natural mix of plant (and therefore animal) life were being suppressed as quickly and consistently as possible, so that sagebrush, and therefore this small number of (literally) target species, could flourish. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Further, the wild horses that roam this state in their thousands are viewed as unwelcome competition for available grass. More than a third of the herd in the refuge, some 860 animals, are culled each year (hopefully to be adopted rather than slaughtered, provided that sufficient new owners can be found and qualified). </p>
              <p class="style2"> Superficially, the wide and empty Range must look and feel to its hunters (provided that they are not aware of the area&rsquo;s historical flora and fauna) didn&rsquo;t think too hard about it) as if it conforms to the following definition, something to make you feel like a good steward of our common natural heritage: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> Land remaining in basically wild (i.e., undisturbed) condition, with few if any traces of human activities.<br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=4&oi=define&q=http://www.nrdc.org/reference/glossary/w.asp"> www.nrdc.org/reference/glossary/w.asp</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> But once again, the reality is that while the refuge is an enormous, empty haunting landscape, in fact it is being managed like any pasture. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Not surprisingly, there is a legal definition of the word &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; in the United States today, and this definition controls what type of most-wild landscapes will survive for us and our children to enjoy. It is with this statutory usage that the exact definition of &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; becomes critical, as well as contentious. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Legal definitions for statutory and regulatory purposes rightly incorporate the public goals that are being served by the legislative effort. For example, if preservation of natural habitats is a desired goal, then criteria such as sustainability become important, since islands of habitat that are too small cannot sustain the full complement of their native species, which go locally extinct. Here is one non-government definition that incorporates this concern: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> An area of land generally greater than 1000 hectares that predominantly retains its natural character and on which the impact of man is transitory and, in the long run, substantially unnoticeable.<br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=5&oi=define&q=http://www.borealforest.org/nwgloss13.htm"> www.borealforest.org/nwgloss13.htm</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> Similarly, if human enjoyment of wilderness is a goal, or if making critical decisions about what terrain will be preserved and what will not, then these criteria must be included as well. Here is an example: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> A part of our natural landscape that is sufficiently large and varied to constitute a more or less self-regulatory ecological unit, where human interference with the land, plants and animals is minimal, and where the beauty and character of the landscape has aesthetic, cultural or scientific significance.<br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=12&oi=define&q=http://www.ccfm.org/ci/gloss_e.html"> www.ccfm.org/ci/gloss_e.html</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              
              <p class="style2"> What Congress eventually adopted as a definition of wilderness, as with any other piece of legislation, represented a balancing of the demands of competing interest groups. In this case, one of the issues that was in play was the ongoing struggle between those that wish to make economic use of public lands (typically these are people that live in proximity to the lands in question) and those that wish to enjoy the same lands first-hand while on vacation, or simply know that they are there and can read about them or see them on television (in the same way that fans of space exploration follow missions avidly, but do not expect to ever board a space ship). The great majority of these people live many hundreds of miles away. Naturally, as fate would have it, it&rsquo;s also true that the former group (and most public lands) are located in &ldquo;Red&rdquo; states, while the latter live in the &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; ones, making the debate even more difficult and spirited than might otherwise be the case. </p>
              <p class="style2"> The definition contained in the statute that was eventually passed in Washington is summarized by one source as follows: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><em> Wilderness:</em> Areas designated by Congressional action under the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness is defined as undeveloped federal land retaining its primeval character and influence without permanent improvements or human habitation. Wilderness areas are protected and managed to preserve their natural conditions, which generally appear to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature with the imprint of human activity substantially unnoticeable; have outstanding opportunities for solitude or for a primitive and confined type of recreation; including at least 5,000 acres or are of sufficient size to make practical their preservation, enjoyment, and use in an unimpaired condition; and may contain features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historic value as well as an ecological and geologic interest. <br>
                      <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=10&oi=define&q=http://www.reo.gov/general/definitions_n-z.htm"> www.reo.gov/general/definitions_n-z.htm</a></em></p>
              </blockquote>              <p class="style2"> The Wilderness Act was indeed a great accomplishment that has resulted in the preservation of many priceless landscapes. But one (to me) regrettable result of the compromises required to achieve its passage is that federally protected wilderness land may (and invariably is) leased for grazing purposes. Of all categories of public land, only National Parks and Monuments are off limits for leasing &ndash; National Forests and all other types of federal land are fair game (with a small number of specific exceptions made for particular pieces of land) for grazing, logging and mining, subject to compliance with other relevant laws and regulations. As administrations change, rules are added and subtracted, depending on the goals of the then-current administration. A recent example is the barring of construction of new access roads for logging and other purposes on certain lands by the Clinton administration, which was later reversed by the current administration. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Given the profound effect that grazing has on ecosystems (and especially so in the dry areas where most federal land is found), this means that the landscape may be empty, beautiful and a joy to visit, but it will never approximate what the same land looked like in its original natural state, nor will it have the full richness of biodiversity that once existed and could, for the most part, exist again. Only in a National Park or Monument may you see that type of landscape beginning to reemerge (Sequoia National Park is a splendid example, especially when the desert flowers are in bloom). </p>
              <p class="style2"> But solitude is harder to achieve in such places, given the heavy usage that many of these parks receive and the non-wilderness infrastructure of roads, campgrounds and interpretive facilities that have been put in place to support such heavy visitation. In other words, the landscape may be more faithful to the original ecosystem, but it is in other ways less of a wilderness. </p>
              <p class="style2"> So how much can a definition matter? At times, a definition can matter greatly, because a definition is a standard upon which laws can be based that determine which precious resources will be preserved, and how, and what we and our children will be able to experience in the course of our lives. </p>

                On August 15, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the organization that accredits United States standards development organizations and represents the United States in the global standards organizations ISO and IEC, announced its 2005 Leadership and Services Awards, which recognize individuals &ldquo;for their significant contributions to national and international standardization activities and ongoing commitment to their industry, their nation and the enhancement of the global voluntary consensus standards system.&rdquo; </span></p>
              <p class="style2"> Included in the press release was the announcement that the 2005 President&rsquo;s Award for Journalism would be given to Andrew Updegrove, the founder, editor and publisher (not to mention sole author) of the Consortium Standards Bulletin, now in its 31st issue, and ConsortiumInfo.org. This is the first time that the award has been given to someone that is not a professional, full-time journalist (previous winners include  Brandon Mitchener of <em>The Wall Street Journal Europe</em>, and David Berlind, of Ziff-Davis <em>ZDNet.com</em>). </p>
              <p class="style2"> The Leadership and Service Awards will be given at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. on October 5, in connection with World Standards Day events. The <a href="http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=1008">press release</a>  reads in part as follows: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p> <span class="style2"><strong> Andrew Updegrove</strong> has been awarded the President's Award for Journalism, which recognizes outstanding journalistic work that helps to illuminate the role that standardization and conformity assessment activities play in improving the health and safety of Americans, while strengthening the competitiveness of U.S. business in a global marketplace. Mr. Updegrove acts as editor and publisher of the <em>Consortium Standards Bulletin</em>, which offers a wealth of information on standards and standards-setting, both online and in print. <em>The Bulletin</em> and website, ConsortiumInfo.org, have helped to raise the profile of standards and highlight their importance to commerce and daily life, as well as encourage greater support for their use and development. </span></p>

              <p class="style2"> On October 5 from 2:00 &ndash; 5:00 PM, Kavi Corporation, ConsortiumInfo.org/ Gesmer Updegrove LLP, Virtual Management, and Jennings Strouss Salmon, will present an interactive analysis of the growing influence of Europe and Asia on technology standard setting organizations. The program takes place during <a href="http://www.ansi.org/meetings_events/wsw05/wsw05.aspx?menuid=8">World Standards Week</a> October 3-7 in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the ANSI Annual Conference. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Attendance is free but <a href="https://seminar.kavi.com/apps/bestpractice/register_contact.php">registration</a> is required. </p>
              <p>The program will feature two sessions, each with its own panel of experts, on the following topics: </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong> Session I: Focus on Europe:</strong><br>
  This session will analyze the most important recent developments in European standard setting policy and practice, including: <br>
  <br>
  ETSI Investigation: Recently it came to light that the antitrust arm of the EC has been conducting a formal investigation into ETSI's IPR policy, seeking to determine if the policy creates an undue risk of &quot;patent ambush&quot; (i.e., the assertion of so-called submarine patents), and/or favors the interests of certain corporate members over others. </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> What are the issues driving the EC action? </li>
                <li class="style2"> Will the EC apply the same scrutiny and criteria to standard setting organizations, whether or not they are headquartered in Europe? </li>
                <li class="style2"> Who may be next on the EC's list? </li>
                <li class="style2"> What should your organization or corporate representatives do (and not do) in the future to steer clear of anti-trust or IPR policy trouble in Europe? </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"> Open Source: The EU and European national governments have been moving much more forcefully in favor of open source software than their counterparts in the United States. From cities (like Munich) to countries (like Norway) to EU agencies, the commitment to open source software has been rising. At the same time, the EU has finally defeated an attempt to amend its patent laws to permit &quot;American style&quot; software patents. </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> How far will this trend go? </li>
                <li class="style2"> What does it mean for U.S. software vendors and users? </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"> The panel will analyze the effect of these events and trends and will attempt to paint a clear picture of what it these developments mean for international vendors, and the standards development community as a whole. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Session II: Focus on China</strong><br>
  After years of relative uninvolvement in global standard setting, China, Korea and Taiwan have awakened to the strategic importance of technology standards, Each country, and China in particular, has become very active in pursuit of alternatives to paying royalties to western companies. </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"> Is their strategy solely one of using standards to create trade barriers? </li>
                <li class="style2"> How effective will/can the WTO process be to influence China's standards policies? </li>
                <li class="style2"> How important is it to actively engage Asian players in existing SSO's? </li>
                <li class="style2"> If Asian governments and companies do become more involved,, what are the risks and rewards of engagement? </li>
                <li class="style2"> What are the practical and operational issues SSO's will face as they reach out to Asian member companies and make them equal partners in developing technology standards? </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"> The panel will review the history of several current Asian standards initiatives (WAPI, TD-SCDMA) in detail in order to illustrate the impact of events to date, and predict what can be expected in the future. </p>

              <strong>eWeek, July 18, 2005&nbsp;-- </strong>The fight to keep software patents out of Europe could change the patent landscape in the United States, too. The last few months have been mainly filled with bad news for those who support innovation in technology and fight against bad laws and policies that mainly serve to prevent innovation. Things were looking pretty bleak, and the fight to keep software patents out of Europe looked like it was going to go down for the count as well. But then finally it happened: good news! The members of the European Parliament stood their ground, showed up in force and soundly defeated the software patents proposal (648-14, with 18 abstentions). <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1836687,00.asp"> ...Full Story</a> </p>

                CNETNews.com August 6, 2005 --</strong> &nbsp;Lawyers, companies, inventors and politicians all agree that the nation's patent system is in desperate need of reform. They cite concerns about proliferating litigation, questionable licenses and a potential decline in American competitiveness. The question is how to reform: For all the complaints, little consensus has emerged on how to fix the system. In the worst-case scenarios, misguided reform efforts could unleash unintended consequences.... The issue is coming to a head in Washington, where committees in the House and Senate are planning hearings on a host of proposals to change the nation's patent law and how the Patent and Trademark Office operates. The ideas being proposed run a wide gamut, from forcing patent holders to license their inventions to others, to the elimination of software patents altogether. <a href="http://news.com.com/Invention+intervention--fixing+the+patent+system/2009-7343_3-5817175.html?tag=st.prev"> ...Full Story</a></p>

The patent application, filed last year and published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, marks the online retailing giant's latest attempt to make inroads into consumers' wallets.

              <p class="style2"><strong>Gesmer Updegrove July 20, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- On July 12, 2005, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in a case that has had patent attorneys holding their collective breath. In Phillips v. AWH Corp., the Federal Circuit attempted to clear up years of confusion and inconsistent rulings, explaining how the operative language in patents is to be interpreted. The Court also spoke to the standard to be used on appeal, when deciding whether trial courts have interpreted &ldquo;patent claim&rdquo; language correctly. While the topic seems to be one only an inventor or his lawyer could love, viewed in context, the Phillips decision represents an important milestone in a ten year journey that has transformed patent jurisprudence. The journey started in 1995, with the Federal Circuit Court&lsquo;s decision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. The Federal Circuit concluded in that case that the scope of a patent should not depend on facts and circumstances particular to the inventor, but rather, it should be divined exclusively from the official patent documents themselves and from objective references, such as treatises and dictionaries. Divorcing patent claim interpretation from traditional factual inquiry meant two things. First, it meant that judges, not juries, were responsible for deciding what the terminology used in a patent claim actually meant. Second, it meant that a court hearing an appeal of that determination (i.e., the Federal Circuit) need not give any deference to the trial court&rsquo;s conclusions. The appeals court was to reach its own conclusions de novo &ndash; a Latin term essentially meaning &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/advisory/072005.php"> ...Full Story</a></p>

                  <strong>BusinessWire, Wakefield, MA, August 1, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- The Smart Active Label Consortium (SAL-C), a non-profit group that promotes the benefits and uses of Smart Active Label technology, today announced that the global standards body ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has authorized a new work program based on SAL-C's contributions. ISO's IEC JTC1 SC31 committee, the body responsible for the creation of the RFID air interface and data structure standards used in supply chain and asset management, approved a work program that will add battery assist and sensor functionality to the existing ISO 18000 series of RFID standards. The new initiative is a direct result of SAL-C's input to SC31 describing the benefits of this functionality to the RFID community, together with a Technical White Paper outlining how the extension could be achieved. <a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20050801005638&newsLang=en"> ...Full Story</a></p>

The appearance of the Debian initiative, called the Debian Core Consortium (DCC) is a blow to the Linux Core Consortium (LCC), announced last summer and backed by Progeny, MandrakeSoft and Turbolinux. However, the LCC says it is forging ahead with its own plans. The DCC, is to be formally announced in August at the LinuxWorld conference, according to Progeny Linux. Progeny, whose chairman Ian Murdock also founded Debian, is spearheading the DCC, with other members including Credativ, Knoppix, LinEx, Linspire, Mepis, Skolelinux, Sun Wah Linux, UserLinux, VA Linux and Xandros.

                  <strong>By: Richard Goering<br>
                Electronic Engineering Times, July 28, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- Is &quot;open&quot; hardware a disruptive technology that will foster the kind of collaboration that Linux brought to the software world? Despite the recent demise of one prominent open-source programmable-logic effort, advocates think so. Given the increasingly prohibitive costs of developing hardware from scratch, open hardware is an attractive possibility. But the road is not easy, and new business models will be needed to support it. <a href="http://www.eetasia.com/ARTICLES/2005JUL/C/2005JUL_ART_WK4.HTM"> ...Full Story</a></p>

                eWeek, August 8, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- IBM plans to release as open-source a sophisticated new search and text analysis technology that is able to find relationships, trends and facts buried in a wide range of unstructured data, including e-mails, Web pages, text documents, images, audio and video. Called the UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture), the technology is able is able to go beyond the keyword analysis typically used by most search engines to discern the semantic meanings within text and other unstructured data, said Nelson Mattos, vice president of information integration with IBM in San Jose, Calif. IBM implemented UIMA in its WebSphere Information Integrator OmniFind Edition as part of its enterprise search platform, which Mattos said was the first commercially available application for this technology. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1844710,00.asp"> ...Full Story</a></p>

Or perhaps you were one of those struggling to grasp new concepts being explored while the instructor raced on to new, additional material. A new training system developed through an EU project will soon change all of this and bring the instruction down (or up) to suit individual students' needs. The Diogene system uses advanced semantic Web technologies, such as metadata and ontologies, to manage the training information. This allows it to intelligently infer when a student is showing signs of struggling and automatically recommend remedial coursework to get a student back on track or to fill in gaps that may have occurred in the student's normal coursework progression. <a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/1004/Default.aspx"> ...Full Story</a></p>

That's the single greatest takeaway I found in a recent study offered up in support of HD-DVD, one of two competing formats in the race for a next-generation disc format with the capacity required for high-definition content. And according to this study, HD-DVD's familiar sound is going to serve it well in the coming format war--which is not a surprising conclusion, considering the study was commissioned by HD-DVD's backers.In July I looked at research released by the Blu-ray Disc Association, the group pushing HD-DVD's rival format. Unlike the more abstractly focused Blu-ray Disc study, which for the most part asked consumers to express general preferences regarding next-generation optical technology without getting into specific formats, the Warner study specifically pitted HD-DVD against Blu-ray Disc. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,122211,00.asp"> ...Full Story</a>

                <strong>Open Geospatial Consortium August 12, 2005</strong> &nbsp;-- There's a bit of invisible magic enabling the mapping website that shows the current positions of the sailing vessels in this year's Rolex Fastnet race from the Isle of Wight to Plymouth. Visitors to http://www.netandsea.com/fastnetrace/ see colorful maps from Netency with regularly updated data on 10 of the 250 yachts. But what pulls all the data together underneath? Elegant open geospatial standards. Netency has covered a series of races on its website since January of this year. The Rolex Fasnet Race is the fifth. How does the company &quot;custom build&quot; a website for each race? It takes advantage of Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC) standards that make calling one map as easy as calling another, no matter what software in the background. Netency can call different background maps for different races from different servers across the world. The real time data on boat locations and winds are automatically overlain to create the real time maps. &quot;OGC specifications were really an important part of the architecture from its conception, in particular the OGC Web Map Service (WMS). The standard provides such flexibility to the website architecture. We can change the rendering of map by just referencing another WMS server!&quot; noted Didier Caillon, the technical lead at Netency. <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/press/?page=pressrelease&year=0&prid=234"> ...Full Story</a></p>
