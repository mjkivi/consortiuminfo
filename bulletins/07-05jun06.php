                  <p align="center" class="style10">HUMAN NATURE AND STANDARD SETTING<br>
                  </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">There are two themes to this issue of the CSB.&nbsp; The overt one is the early (&quot;<em>ex ante</em>&quot;)  disclosure of licensing terms, a new concept that many would like to  incorporate into the standard setting processes of some standard setting  organizations (SSOs), and that others object to on commercial grounds or out of  concern over potential legal risks.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The more subtle theme acknowledges the fact that when something  new and unknown is being considered, people innately split into two camps:  those that focus on the potential benefits, and those that fixate on all  conceivable risks.&nbsp; The result is that  achieving consensus can at times become unusually challenging, since each side  is looking at the same prospect (as it were) through the opposite end of the telescope.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">I introduce both of these themes in this month's <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>,  which focuses on the invitation by the Chairman of the Department of Justice to  SSOs to embrace &ndash; with care &ndash; <em>ex ante</em> disclosure rather than to dismiss  it out of hand.&nbsp; This invitation appeals  to the innovators, who see the benefits that can be gained from greater  certainty of outcome in standard setting, and are willing to accept the risk in  order to secure this reward.&nbsp; But the  same process that appeals to the innovators is threatening to those that react  to the unknown by retreating to the security of established boundaries,  accepting less satisfactory, but safer outcomes.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong> for June provides an in-depth  examination of what <em>ex ante</em> disclosure is all about, what the range of  possibilities of implementation are, and how such practices fit within the  existing menu of mechanisms that are available to achieve the same goals.&nbsp; By taking this approach, I hope to make <em>ex  ante</em> disclosure seem less threatening and monolithic, as well as to suggest  when it, or another alternative, could be most useful for a given SSO.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection this month provides an  example of how deficient traditional RAND (&quot;reasonable and  non-discriminatory&quot;) licensing commitments can be, using the breakdown of  licensing negotiations between Adobe and Microsoft, using the current  example.&nbsp; When negotiations were  abandoned, Microsoft was left without the right to include a &quot;save to  PDF&quot; function in its upcoming Vista release of its popular Office suite,  despite the fact that Adobe has made elements of the PDF specification  available to ISO/IEC under a RAND licensing obligation.&nbsp; In this context, the appeal of ex ante  licensing, in contrast to the vagueness of difficult to enforce RAND obligations,  becomes more clear.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">My <strong><em>Consider This&hellip;</em></strong> essay this month returns to the  theme of human nature, and focuses on how our behavior has evolved over the  millennia to engender two very different political philosophies (conservative  and liberal), examines why this makes sense under evolutionary theory, and  suggests that this process provides an excellent example of what could  reasonably be considered to be the first open source project in human history.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As usual, the issue ends  with <strong><em>The Rest of the News</em></strong>, being a selection of what I thought  were the most interesting and important stories of the last month.&nbsp;</p>
                  <div align="left" class="style2">Finally, and as  always, I hope you enjoy this issue.&nbsp;</div>

                <p align="left" class="style2">It seems  intrinsic to human nature that innovation is inevitably followed by  ossification.&nbsp; Each new idea is more  likely to be challenged than welcomed, but once it becomes incorporated into  accepted wisdom, it becomes the new normative referent &ndash; what has become  fashionable today to call a &quot;paradigm.&quot;</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Both of  the personality types that set up this paradox make sense in their own  ways&nbsp; &ndash; the innovator takes greater risks  and, when successful, reaps greater rewards, while the average Joe plays it  safe, settles for less, and supports the status quo that has been proven to  work in the past, at least well enough.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Why  ossification, though?&nbsp; Perhaps because  there are more technicians than innovators in the world, and because the former  values security.&nbsp; But whatever the  reason, when new ideas come along, there is a tendency to attack the risk of  change simply because it is change, and with change comes uncertainty.&nbsp; Better to shoot something down and take no  chances than to put something on the line in the hopes of gaining the benefit  of those changes that prove to be beneficial.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">For  better or worse, lawyers are particularly well equipped as well as apt to  defend the status quo when innovative suggestions are made in many contexts,  one of which is the further evolution of intellectual property rights  policies.&nbsp; The stakes are high (e.g.,  gaining the maximum return on valuable patent rights, and strict antitrust laws  that provide for severe penalties), and the law is complex.&nbsp; It is very easy to paint things in black and  white, and to offer dire predictions based upon extreme cases rather than to  dissect a situation or proposal, isolate the problematic elements, develop a  prudent strategy to address each issue, and allow the innovation to be tested  in the marketplace and succeed or fail.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Currently,  there is a debate in progress in a number of standard setting organizations  (SSO) that provides an excellent example of this dichotomy in action.&nbsp; The subject of debate is so-called &quot;<em>ex  ante</em>&quot; disclosure (and even negotiation) of licensing terms, meaning  that those that hold patent claims that would be infringed by the  implementation of a new standard could not only announce (as they do today in  many SSOs) the existence of such claims and their willingness to make them  available on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms before the standard  in question is adopted, but would also be permitted (or required) to reveal the  specific economic and other terms upon which they would make those claims  available to implementers.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">The  value of such disclosures is clear, since there would be greater predictability  of result in standards creation, with fewer laboriously created standards later  becoming handicapped by excessive royalties or other fees or terms that inhibit  broad adoption.&nbsp; Of course, <em>ex ante</em> disclosure would not be a total panacea, since it would have no impact on  non-members of the SSO creating the standard, but there have been many examples  of valuable standards that have been excessively encumbered by the demands of  those that have participated in the development process itself.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">How  risky would such a procedure be under the antitrust laws?&nbsp; In fact, full negotiation of pricing terms  among direct competitors would be dicey indeed.&nbsp; While not out of the question, it would require care and  additional infrastructure.&nbsp; But less  radical proposals &ndash; such as mandatory disclosure of licensing terms, and in  particular simply enabling voluntary disclosure &ndash; can readily be addressed with  reasonable and non-burdensome process controls, even when pricing terms are  included.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In fact, <em>ex ante</em> disclosure is no more problematic than many other practices that  are already accepted as part of the current standard setting paradigm, such as  the formation of patent pools (where price negotiations already occur) and the  adoption of intellectual property rights policies that forbid royalties  entirely.&nbsp; Each has its own antitrust  risks, and in each case, these risks have been analyzed and addressed to the  satisfaction of those involved.&nbsp; Both  are accepted practices today, although each was seen as threatening (both  commercially as well as legally) when first proposed.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Significantly,  the antitrust regulators in the United States &ndash; the Department of Justice and  the Federal Trade Commission &ndash; have gone out of their way to encourage  innovation in this regard.&nbsp; Most  notably, DOJ Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras issued a policy statement last  December that was dedicated to reassuring industry with respect to the  viability of <em>ex ante</em> disclosure under the antitrust laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; That statement did not suggest that the  enforcement agencies would turn a blind eye to improper behavior.&nbsp; But it did send a clear signal that the agencies  recognize the procompetitive effects that <em>ex ante</em> disclosure could have,  and offered assurance that experiments in this area would be assessed by  regulators using the &quot;rule of reason&quot; test, which balances such  procompetitive results with any related anticompetitive impact.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">It  should also not fail to be noted that the Chairman's statement was made in  response to the requests of major corporate participants in standard  setting.&nbsp; This prompt and productive  action represents a rare and commendable example of government acting in  support of industry to facilitate the competitiveness and efficiency of  American production.&nbsp; </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">It would  be a regrettable example of ossification if American SSOs did not embrace the  opportunity that has been offered to it.&nbsp;  The advancement of technology is all about innovation, and lawyers must  be as willing to innovate as their clients.&nbsp;  Otherwise, they are working against, rather than in support of, the best  interests of those that they serve.&nbsp;  Happily, many, if not all, of those engaged in the current debate are of  this opinion as well.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">It's  time for the rest of those involved, whether they are business people or  attorneys, to get on the <em>ex ante</em> bus.&nbsp;  Together, they can work towards crafting the type of prudent and  non-burdensome policies and safeguards that can help assure that those that are  doing the real work of creating technical specifications will release standards  that are not only technically useful, but commercially viable as well.</p>

              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Introduction:</em></strong> On June 27 and 28 of 2005,  representatives of five of the largest technology companies in the world met  with senior members of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade  Commission.&nbsp; Those five companies were  Apple, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Sun Microsystems, and their common  objective in seeking an audience with the top antitrust regulators in the  country was to encourage the federal authorities to offer public support for  so-called <em>ex ante</em> disclosures of patent licensing terms in accredited  and unaccredited standard setting organizations (SSOs). </p>
              <p class="style2"><em>&quot;Ex ante&quot; </em>is the  Latin phrase that antitrust lawyers and economists use to describe discussions  of licensing terms that occur &quot;beforehand&quot; in the standard setting  process, as compared to <em>ex post</em>, or &quot;afterwards.&quot;&nbsp; The point in time to which both relate is  the formal adoption of a standard, and the significance of such timing is that  disclosures made prior to adoption can be taken into account in creating a  standard, while those that follow cannot.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">While the owner of a patent  claim that would necessarily be infringed by implementing a standard (a  &quot;Necessary Claim&quot;) has long been encouraged or required in many SSOs  to disclose <em>ex ante </em>whether it would commit to license the Necessary  Claim on &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory&quot; (RAND) terms, it has  almost never been required to disclose the specifics (e.g., the royalty rate)  of such a license.&nbsp; Those discussions  today only occur outside the SSO (usually <em>ex post)</em> on a one-on-one,  confidential basis between the owner of the Necessary Claim and the would-be  implementer.&nbsp; In some SSOs, <em>ex ante</em> disclosures of licensing terms within the standard setting process are  specifically prohibited.</p>
              <p class="style2">The primary reason for  avoiding all but the most general <em>ex ante</em> disclosures has been  trepidation over the possibility of violating the antitrust laws - or even  being unsuccessfully charged with such a violation, given the high cost of  defending such a charge. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">2</a> Moreover, the available penalties for antitrust infractions include not only  treble damages and payment of the opposition's attorney fees, but criminal  penalties for individuals as well.&nbsp;  Given that such discussions by their nature are among competitors,  sometimes comprising the great majority of the &quot;market power&quot; in a  given situation under the antitrust laws, the legal counsel of those involved  have been understandably leery of permitting their companies to risk crossing  over a line which is at best blurred.</p>
              <p class="style2">At the same time, there are  also costs to avoiding such discussions, most obviously when someone that has  promised a RAND license does not make the size of its required royalty known  until well after the marketplace has become &quot;locked in&quot; to that  standard through wide adoption &ndash; and then demands what implementers believe to  be an exorbitant fee, resulting in the marketplace being &quot;held up,&quot;  in the parlance of economists and antitrust experts.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">The situation can be still  worse, when multiple patent owners each assess royalties or other fees.&nbsp; In such a case, the result can be the total  (or near total) failure of the standard setting process, as in the case of the 3GPP  telecommunications standard.&nbsp; That unhappy  specification, by multiple accounts, is encumbered by royalty obligations that  exceed 100% of the nominal price of the products it enables.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">3</a>&nbsp; In the face of such stark realities, those  impacted understandably go in search of a solution, especially in those  industry sectors where participants believe that the frequency of hold ups is  increasing.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">4</a></p>
              <p class="style2">The solution that the five  companies that met with the antitrust authorities in the summer of 2005  proposed was that a greater degree of tolerance should be shown for, at  minimum, the disclosure by owners of Necessary Claims of the economic and other  licensing terms that they would require from implementers.&nbsp; Absent such knowledge, they contended, those  that set standards are incapable of creating the most &quot;economically  efficient&quot; standards: i.e., the specifications that provide the best  balance between technical excellence and total cost of implementation.&nbsp; This would especially be so when multiple  technical avenues (each with Necessary Claims owned by different SSO members)  are available to achieve the same desired result, and when deciding whether to  make a given feature mandatory or optional in a compliant implementation.</p>
              <p class="style2">The result of the June  meetings between the technology companies and the regulators was not  random.&nbsp; Rather, discussions (sometimes  heated) over whether or not to permit <em>ex ante</em> discussions were already  under way in multiple venues, including the Patent Policy Working Group of the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Patent Committee of the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association  (IEEE-SA) and the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""> 5</a></p>
              <div>
                <p class="style2">The result of that meeting  and other input from the marketplace was a speech by FTC Chairman Deborah Platt  Majoras, delivered on September 23, 2005 via pre-recorded video to a conference  held at Stanford University.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">6</a>&nbsp; In that speech, Chairman Majoras sought to  reassure the marketplace that, while no blank check would be written for  competitors to negotiate licensing terms, the antitrust authorities did  recognize the potential value of <em>ex ante</em> disclosures and discussions,  and would employ the &quot;rule of reason&quot; if called upon to assess such  conduct.&nbsp; Under that rule, regulators  balance the pro-competitive benefits that can be anticipated from the behavior  in question with any anticompetitive impact that could also result.&nbsp; Broadly speaking, if the former outweighs  the latter, then the practices in question are held not to violate applicable  law.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">7</a></p>
                <p class="style2">With that encouragement, the  debate over <em>ex ante</em> disclosures broadened and deepened, but did not  become any less difficult.&nbsp; In fact, the  debate has become more heated, since a breakthrough on <em>ex ante</em> disclosures now seems within the realm of possibility.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">8</a>&nbsp; Many lengthy email debates have been waged  in consequence on list-serves hosted by the American Bar Association Section of  Science and Technology, ANSI, IEEE and elsewhere.&nbsp; These debates have sometimes assumed an all or nothing, black or  white dynamic, making agreement on any actual plan of action extremely  difficult to reach.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">9</a>&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">As of this date, the  discussions in several venues have matured to a point where it is useful to  anticipate what the first changes to SSO intellectual property rights (IPR)  policies to accommodate <em>ex ante</em> disclosures are likely to be.&nbsp; While these changes are apt to be modest  rather than radical, they nonetheless provide a public proving ground that will  demonstrate &ndash; or disprove &ndash; the value of <em>ex ante</em> disclosure, thus  providing a model for other SSOs to evaluate in considering whether or not to  modify their own IPR policies and rules of procedure.</p>
                <p class="style2">At the same time, it is  important to note that permitting <em>ex ante</em> discussions is only one tool  that can be used to approach, or indeed to surpass, the same goal of achieving  satisfactory results.&nbsp; In this sense,  the <em>ex ante</em> debate is to some degree of greater significance to  accredited standards development organizations (SDOs) rather than consortia,  since the latter have engaged in a greater degree of experimentation in  licensing and disclosure requirements than the former, and the members of  consortia have often been willing to accept a more stringent set of  requirements as regards Necessary Claims than has traditionally prevailed in  SDOs.</p>
                <p class="style2">As a result of this  experimentation, there exists a variety of alternative mechanisms that SDOs and  other SSOs can consider in addition to <em>ex ante</em> disclosures in order to  achieve not only greater predictability of outcome, but also lower final cost  to implementers, and therefore end-users and other consumers.&nbsp; The <em>ex ante</em> disclosure mechanism  should therefore be seen as an important addition to the standard setting  toolkit, but not as the only tool available to achieve the same ends, nor as  the final and ultimate refinement of the SSO process. </p>
                <p class="style2">In this article, I will  review the context within which the <em>ex ante</em> debate is occurring, the  range of <em>ex ante</em> techniques that can be considered, and the first IPR  policy modifications that are likely to see the light of day.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">10</a>&nbsp; I will also review the currently available  alternative mechanism that SSOs may wish to consider that represent less  radical (and in some cases more dramatic) changes to their policies and  procedures that may provide meaningful relief while incurring limited risk and  not unduly burdening the standard setting process.</p>
                <p class="style2"><strong>I.&nbsp; The current system</strong></p>
                <p class="style2"><strong><em>The problem with RAND:</em></strong>&nbsp; The most  frequent, and perhaps most imperfect, example of <em>ex ante</em> disclosure in  use today is the commitment to license Necessary Claims on &quot;reasonable and  non-discriminatory terms.&quot;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">11</a>&nbsp; While simple in concept, this phrase has  many shortcomings in practice.&nbsp; Most  significantly, the words &quot;reasonable&quot; and  &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; have no precise meaning.&nbsp; Somewhat counter intuitively, some that  participate in the development of SSO policies have often resisted defining  these terms more precisely.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">12</a>&nbsp; The concept of a &quot;reasonable&quot;  royalty or other fee is particularly problematic.&nbsp; Is a royalty &quot;reasonable&quot; if it is based upon the  monopoly value that inclusion in a standard can convey, or should the  reasonableness of the royalty be based upon its value on a non-inclusion  basis?&nbsp; Similarly, where multiple  Necessary Claims, owned by multiple owners, are infringed by a single standard,  is the royalty demanded by an individual owner of a Necessary Claim  &quot;reasonable&quot; only if the total of all royalties relating to the  standard does not exceed what the market will bear?&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">A further difficulty is that  the terms of the actual licenses entered into between the owner of a Necessary  Claim(s) and any individual implementer are likely to be confidential,  especially if a royalty is involved.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">13</a>&nbsp; How then is one implementer to know whether  it has in fact been granted &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; terms?&nbsp; And even if the terms agreed upon in all  cases were to be known, would both the licensor and the licensee agree on  whether the facts were comparable in two different licenses, after all volume,  underlying cross-license, non-economic license terms, and other variables had  been taken into account?<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">14</a>&nbsp; Moreover, antitrust regulators in the United  States are loath to become involved in whether or not a given royalty is too  high.&nbsp; As one regulator cautioned:</p>
                <div>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">Bringing  a complaint to the Antitrust Division about &quot;excessive&quot; royalties, without  more, is a losing strategy. Antitrust enforcers are not in the business of  price control. We protect a competitive process, not a particular result, and  particularly not a specific price. In fact, if a monopoly is lawfully obtained,  whether derived from IP rights or otherwise, we do not even object to setting a  monopoly price. A high patent royalty rate, after all, might just reflect that  the Patent Act is functioning correctly and the market is rewarding an inventor  for a pioneering invention. When a complainant begins a presentation by telling  the Antitrust Division that a royalty rate is &quot;excessive,&quot; the staff  responds that the complainant is putting the cart before the horse. A  complaining party must first identify some anticompetitive conduct beyond a  mere unilateral refusal to license and beyond the mere attempt to charge, where  a lawful monopoly exists, a monopoly price.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style2">Why then do some SSO members  not simply define the RAND obligation more exactly?&nbsp; There are several reasons why this does not appear to offer a  palatable alternative to <em>ex ante</em> disclosure.&nbsp; The first is that while vendors do not wish to be charged  extortionate fees when they are licensees, neither do they wish to have their  freedom of action systemically limited when they are on the opposite side of  the licensing equation as patent owners.&nbsp;  Further, opening up the RAND Pandora's box would lead to discussion of  such difficult questions as what to do about existing cross licenses?&nbsp; Frequently, there are underlying licensing  agreements already in existence between the largest vendors.&nbsp; When a new standard is approved that  involves the Necessary Claims of some subset of such a group, there may be few,  if any, royalties that actually change hands among the group.</p>
                  <p class="style2">In such a situation, what  should &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; mean?&nbsp;  That smaller companies that lack an existing cross license agreement  with the owner of Necessary Claims should receive a royalty-free license as  well?&nbsp; Currently, that is not the case,  and many large companies would doubtless prefer to maintain that state of  affairs, as it provides at minimum an advantage over, and at times perhaps an  effective barrier to entry by, smaller companies that might otherwise wish to  build competitive implementations of the same standard.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Because even the largest  companies in the information and communications technology sectors are today  feeling the pain of a spate of what are perceived to be excessive royalty  demands by the owners of Necessary Claims under important standards, these companies  are seeking an alternative solution to refining the RAND definition in order to  relieve their stress.&nbsp; And that solution  is <em>ex ante</em> disclosure.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">16</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong>II.&nbsp; The <em>Ex Ante</em> Alternative</strong></p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Why ex ante?&nbsp; </em></strong>While the potential value of <em>ex ante</em> disclosures is accepted by  most (if not all), there are costs as well as benefits to be considered in  adopting an IPR policy that permits, or requires, such revelations.&nbsp; Further, due to antitrust concerns, the  optimal timing, degree, and process of disclosure is a matter of debate, with  some advocating for conservatism and others for aggressiveness.&nbsp; Thoroughly understanding these costs and  benefits is essential, given that standards development is a consensus-based  process, and the value proposition supporting any type of <em>ex ante</em> disclosure must therefore be clear to at least a significant majority of the  decision makers of any given SSO before the necessary process changes can be  approved.</p>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Benefits: the arguments in favor:</em></strong>&nbsp; Proponents of <em>ex ante</em> disclosure cite  the following motivations (some of which have been already mentioned above) for  advocating such disclosures:</p>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Chaos:&nbsp; </em></strong>The current disclosure system represents a       disorderly bazaar, rather than an orderly marketplace.&nbsp; If an economically efficient result       occurs, it is only by accident.&nbsp; As       a result, the likelihood of efficiency is very low.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Variations in experience:</em></strong>&nbsp;       Different industries have widely divergent practices, to the       disadvantage of those that are not versed in the ways of that       industry.&nbsp; For example, in some       standard settings, there are active contemporaneous one-on-one       negotiations among patent owners and would-be implementers &quot;in the       halls,&quot; resulting in advantages for those that are skilled in       horse-trading</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Certainty:</em></strong>&nbsp; In some SSOs, it is common       to make blanket statements that reserve the right to assert a patent and       require a royalty, without requiring the respondent to disclose the       Necessary Claims themselves.&nbsp; As a       result, would-be implementers not only cannot evaluate whether a royalty       may need to be paid (does the respondent actually have a Necessary Claim       at all?), but whether it agrees that the claim in question is in fact an       enforceable Necessary Claim.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Avoidance of total failure:</em></strong>&nbsp;       Developing a high quality, useful standard is lengthy and time-consuming       process.&nbsp; If one or more patent       owners later set unduly high royalty rates or impose other burdensome       licensing terms, even the best standard, from a technical perspective, may       totally fail.&nbsp; In such a case, not       only the investment in the standard itself, but the much higher value to       vendors, service providers and end-users alike of the failure to       effectively fill a standards gap may be very high indeed.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Slow adoption:</em></strong>&nbsp; Every       standard must survive a critical period during which the market decides whether       or not to adopt it, with many implementers adopting a &quot;wait and       see&quot; attitude.&nbsp; Where       licensing terms are known in advance, early adopters can enter the market       more quickly, without the need to engage in licensing negotiations where       each side may be testing the other, and all would-be implementers can make       more intelligent assumptions about whether adopting the standard will       prove to be a good bet or not.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Avoidance of RAND non-discrimination risk:</em></strong>&nbsp; Where       licensing terms are out in the open, each participant has a much higher       level of assurance that it is getting fair terms relative to other       similarly-situated industry players, and that it is getting the vendor's       &quot;best price&quot; as well &ndash; somewhat akin to buying from a &quot;no       haggling&quot; car dealer.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Effect:</em></strong>&nbsp; Not every standard setting       participant would welcome even the &quot;social pressure&quot; of a       voluntary disclosure policy, since the hoped-for result of such a policy       would be to provide incentives to owners of potential Necessary Claims to       not only lay their cards on the table, but perhaps to engage in a reverse       auction as well.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="style2">While recognizing the  validity of these concerns, it is worth noting that many of the issues  associated with <em>ex ante</em> disclosures already exist &ndash; they simply arise at  other points and outside the process that begins with the chartering of a  working group, and ends with the wide deployment of a standard.&nbsp; In short, in order to decide on a net basis  whether <em>ex ante</em> disclosure provides a net benefit or a net cost in  comparison to the current regime as to a single standard, the entire standards  creation and deployment cycle must be taken into consideration, including the  costs, delays and negative effects in the current system that would be reduced  or eliminated by the introduction of <em>ex ante</em> disclosures.&nbsp; When conversion to <em>ex ante</em> disclosure  is considered on a systemic basis, the development and opportunity costs of  those standards that failed due to hold-ups should be factored into the  calculations as well.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Ex ante variations:</em></strong>&nbsp; There are a  variety of ways that one could imagine introducing an <em>ex ante</em> element  into the standard setting process.&nbsp; The  following examples are presented in ascending order of complexity and risk, but  not in sufficient detail to more than suggest the types of process elements and  antitrust risks that would need to be considered before any of them were to be  actually put into place.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Removing prohibitions on voluntary disclosure:</em></strong>&nbsp; The simplest alternative is simply to remove  any prohibitions in an IPR policy that would prohibit one member from informing  other participants in the standard setting process about its specific licensing  intentions.&nbsp; Since any such act would be  voluntary, neither the SSO nor the other members of the SSO would be forced to  disclose, nor, assuming the absence of additional facts, would there be any  collusion between members to establish either a ceiling or a floor on what a  member could demand.&nbsp; Only some SSOs  currently have such a prohibition, but one of them is the IEEE.&nbsp; As a result, this is one approach that is  currently under discussion there.&nbsp;  However, without providing any additional process steps, such voluntary  disclosures might arise at less useful times, and there might be additional  process requirements that would diminish, rather than increase both the effectiveness  of the disclosure as well as lower the risk of antitrust slipups by others  responding to the disclosure.</p>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Permitting and enabling voluntary disclosure:</em></strong>&nbsp; If the hope would be that voluntary  disclosures would become a regular and useful adjunct to the standard setting  process, they could be channeled in a way that was most likely to result in the  benefits desired.&nbsp; For example, the time  when such disclosures were permitted to be made could be restricted to a point  in the standard setting process that was far enough along that the likelihood  of infringement could be well assessed by both the owners of would-be Necessary  Claim as well as by the other members of the standards working group, and yet  early enough that a decision could be made to design around Necessary Claims of  patents, the terms of which were not deemed to be acceptable.&nbsp; In those processes that commonly begin with  the offer of multiple proposals, each of which could form the basis for the  resulting standard, the disclosures could be required at the time of  submission.</p>
                  <p class="style2">In order to be maximally  useful, any SSO that did not already require the disclosure of Necessary Claims  would wish to introduce that requirement as well, even if <em>ex ante</em> disclosure of licensing terms was not mandatory.&nbsp; Absent such a rule, the goal of predictability and the  opportunity to make economically efficient choices between technical value and  costs would be defeated, and the prospect would remain that a working group  member could later assert a Necessary Claim and require payments that would  have been avoided had they been disclosed in timely fashion.</p>
                  <p class="style2">For the same reason, it  would be highly desirable to have strong assurances that all participants in a  standards development working group had, in fact, disclosed all Necessary  Claims.&nbsp; Unfortunately, SSOs members  have not historically been willing to provide this level of certainty.&nbsp; For example, patent disclosures and  assertions are most often made in SSOs under a fairly lax &quot;to the  knowledge of the individual participant&quot; basis.&nbsp; Tightening this requirement, while still not requiring formal  patent searches or imposing penalties for inadvertent failures to disclose,  would increase the predictability of the final result.&nbsp; In fact, the IEEE is currently revising its  standard patent disclosure form (which it calls a &quot;Letter of Assurance for  Essential Patent Claims) to accomplish just this result.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">20</a>&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2">Absent a desire to be more  selective, disclosure of Necessary Claims could still be done within the  context of the traditional three basic choices (RAND or non-assertion without  charge; RAND with right to charge royalties reserved; or no assurance of RAND  licensing at all).&nbsp; By combining a  strong Necessary Claim disclosure obligation with the ability to make <em>ex  ante</em> disclosure of specific licensing terms, there would be a degree of  &quot;social pressure&quot; for all owners of Necessary Claims to announce  terms if they had a strong desire that their patent claims be included rather  than excluded in the final specification.&nbsp;  Those owners of Necessary Claims that were not highly motivated to have  their IPR included could either disclose high royalty requirements, not  disclose terms, or not elect to license their Necessary Claims at all.&nbsp; In each of these cases, other working group  members would be on notice that inclusion of these claims would be, as  appropriate, too expensive, too risky, or not possible at all.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                    Such a system could provide  lower costs of implementation as well as greater certainty in SSOs where there  are perceived indirect benefits to inclusion of Necessary Claims, since a  combination of strong disclosure obligations and <em>ex ante</em> disclosure  could be expected to lead to a competitive sealed bid environment.&nbsp; This would be particularly true if all  disclosures were required to be made on a simultaneous basis, providing an  incentive for an owner of Necessary Claims to put its lowest, best offer  forward.&nbsp; At the same time, no specific  disclosure, or indeed any disclosure at all, would be required, easing,  although not eliminating, antitrust concerns.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Necessarily, if price and  other terms are introduced at a time that collective action can be taken to  select among alternatives, or to change the design of a draft specification to  avoid infringement (and therefore payment), care would need to be taken in  designing the process in such as way as to forbid inappropriate discussion,  bargaining or other behavior that could be problematic under the antitrust  laws.&nbsp; The simplest and safest approach  would be to prohibit any discussion among working group participants regarding  the specific licensing terms disclosed, but permit the knowledge of those terms  to inform the voting decisions of individual members.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Permitting and enabling disclosure and  rebidding:&nbsp; </em></strong>While a &quot;sealed  bid&quot; system would provide real advantages over a merely RAND process,  providing Necessary Claim owners with the opportunity to rebid would permit a  &quot;reverse auction&quot; dynamic to arise, leading in some cases to yet  lower implementation costs without appreciably increasing antitrust risks.&nbsp; The best way to minimize antitrust risks  would be prohibit all discussions relating to terms among those disclosing  Necessary Claims, as well as between other members and those making  disclosures, until the bidding process was complete, following which voting  would immediately commence.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Permitting and enabling disclosure, rebidding and discussion:</em></strong>&nbsp; While  permitting <em>ex ante</em> disclosure and rebidding would provide real  advantages, it would be unfortunate if this was to be at the cost of permitting  working groups to discuss whether specific Necessary Claims could be designed  around entirely.&nbsp; As a result, an  optimized process would specify what topics were fair game to discuss, and what  topics were off limits, with (at minimum) the refinement of designs to avoid  Necessary Claims being on the list of permitted discussion topics.&nbsp; Working groups could also be allowed to  formulate alternative proposals (each with a different mix of Necessary Claims)  for member voting, leaving each member to individually decide which alternative  provided the best balance between cost and technical result.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Permitting and enabling disclosure, rebidding, discussion and  negotiation:</em></strong>&nbsp; Adding the ability for working group members  to actually negotiate licensing terms would be a much more delicate process to  police, since the potential exists for a group of members to inappropriately  pressure an individual member, opening the way to conspiracy and other  charges.&nbsp; In addition, antitrust  regulators in some countries might view such a process unfavorably regardless  of any safeguards that were put into place.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Requiring disclosure:&nbsp; </em></strong>Requiring, rather than permitting, the <em>ex ante</em> disclosure of terms by all holders of potential Necessary Claims could be added  as an additional term in most of the scenarios discussed above.&nbsp; Doing so would, of course, increase the  completeness of the economic IPR landscape for a give standard under  development, but would present its own antitrust issues, as well as perhaps  leading to some patent owners deciding not be join the SSO with that policy at  all, or not to join in as many working groups, if only direct participants  would be become subject to this requirement.</p>
                  <p class="style2">It would appear unlikely  that the first SSOs to adopt policies with additional <em>ex ante</em> features  would choose to begin with as adventurous a list of changes as those that  appear towards the end of the above list, rather than opting to pursue a more  limited and conservative approach</p>
                  <p class="style2">In any situation that does  not involve actual discussion, it should be possible to design a process that  would not require immediate supervision by lawyers.&nbsp; Even where discussion would be involved, there is no reason to  assume that individual members would need to arrive at meetings with lawyers in  tow.&nbsp; In each of the scenarios short of  actual negotiation, all member-related legal and economic decisions could be  made at the facilities of individual members by appropriate business and legal  personnel, and submitted in writing as part of a clear and controlled process.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">21</a></p>
                  <p class="style2">No matter what process was  adopted, the chairs of technical committees and others in charge of the process  would need to be carefully instructed regarding which types of behavior would  be permissible and which would not, and any existing antitrust policy  (typically general rather than specific) would merit review and revision to  provide more helpful and detailed guidance.&nbsp;  Of course, technical chairs should in all cases be well coached on basic  antitrust rules, since there are many other situations that are apt to arise  that can present equivalent, or greater antitrust risk.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>III.&nbsp; <em>Ex Ante</em> Alternatives</strong></p>
                  <p class="style2">As earlier noted, <em>ex ante</em> disclosure represents only one among a number of procedures that may be  employed to better flesh out the IPR landscape underlying a given standards  development effort.&nbsp; Each of these  procedures has its own advantages (and shortcomings) that may lead it to be a  superior technique to use instead of, or a useful tool to use in addition to, <em>ex  ante</em> disclosure.&nbsp; Accordingly, every  SSO should consider the entire range of options available to it when  considering any change of its process to incorporate <em>ex ante</em> disclosure.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Current disclosure practices  in fact vary widely, ranging from IPR policies that forbid disclosure of licensing  terms to policies that mandate royalty free licensing, or indeed impose blanket  prohibitions on asserting patents at all.&nbsp;  Consequently, the concept of <em>ex ante</em> disclosure does not  represent the bleeding edge of IPR policy evolution, but rather a refinement of  practice that may overlay an intermediate section of the spectrum of current  SSO IPR policy practice.&nbsp; These  disclosure practices (in addition to the widely-used, and already discussed,  RAND disclosure regime) and the terms that may attach to them <em>ex post</em> include the following:</p>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>The patent pool:</em></strong>&nbsp; Nominally the formation of a patent pool should provide relief to  the problem of excess royalties, while simultaneously alleviating the burden to  implementers of engaging in multiple license negotiations. &nbsp;In brief, a patent pool imposes a voluntary  license cap on all patent owners, and includes a mutually agreeable formula for  allocating royalties received among the patent owners, based upon importance  patent claims, remaining life of patent, and so on.&nbsp; However, patent pools are difficult to form, can be ineffective  unless all owners of Necessary Claims participate, and have their own antitrust  sensitivities, among other challenges.&nbsp;  As a result, there usage has not been widespread.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Nevertheless, the patent  pool is interesting in the current context, since the formation of such a pool  is an exercise not only in complete <em>ex ante</em> disclosure (or <em>ex post</em>,  if the standard in question has already been approved), but in <em>ex ante</em> negotiation as well, since all patents are disclosed, each is frequently  evaluated by a neutral third party, and all owners then decide whether they  will join the patent pool on terms offered or not.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Patent pools are also  instructive in the context of other <em>ex ante</em> mechanisms, because they  provide something of a model for SSO-imposed license fee caps, a concept that  has been reported to be currently under discussion within ETSI.&nbsp; Patent pools formed in the United States  typically obtain a business review or advisory opinion from the antitrust  regulators, and there is therefore a degree of public record on how such  mechanisms are viewed under applicable law that could be consulted to  advantage.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>The Royalty Free Commitment:</em></strong>&nbsp; Some consortia and forums adopt  policies that moot the <em>ex ante</em> issue entirely by simply providing that  participants agree not to assert royalties at all.&nbsp; This goal is typically difficult to obtain, however, because the  perceived value of participation to each member must outweigh the opportunity  of leveraging its patent portfolio against the resulting standard.&nbsp; For companies with very large patent  portfolios, the tradeoff is more difficult to assess absent an expensive and  time consuming review of its patent portfolio, and the danger remains that the  SSO may in the future enter technical territory that was not initially  anticipated.</p>
                  <p class="style2">As a result, royalty free  commitments are most typical in situations where the membership is small, and  is made up of highly-committed participants with a unitary and often more  limited scope of work.&nbsp; Often, these  arrangements are created on an unincorporated &quot;promoter-adopter&quot;  model that is closer to a cross license agreement than a by-laws and IPR policy  regulated, incorporated SSO.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">22</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where such a rule is adopted by an SSO, it  is typically the result of a conviction that the imposition of royalties (and  sometimes of other types of licensing terms) would effectively thwart the goals  of the SSO.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">23</a>&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2">Because there is no freedom  to charge a royalty, <em>ex ante</em> disclosure of specific patent claims is  largely unnecessary, although some organizations include a provision that  allows a member to either place a patent claim off limits early in the process,  or the opportunity to resign as a member to avoid capture of its patent claims  by the royalty free obligation.</p>
                  <p class="style2">An increasingly popular  variation in practice is the use of the &quot;non-assertion covenant&quot; in  place of a commitment to license without a royalty.&nbsp; This mechanism is elegant in its simplicity: the owner of potential  patent claims simply states that it will not assert the patent claims (if any)  that it may own against any compliant implementation of the standard in  question.&nbsp; The SSO member therefore need  not search for nor identify any Necessary Claims, and the implementer has no  license agreement to negotiate and accept.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">24</a></p>
                  <p class="style2">The royalty free commitment  is a superior and more complete alternative to <em>ex ante</em> disclosure for a  variety of reasons.&nbsp; Notably, there is  no recurring need to disclose license terms, to make adoption decisions based  in part on price considerations, or any need (or temptation) to engage in  price-related negotiations, all of which substantially obviates (absent  additional facts) much of the antitrust risk that worries those considering <em>ex  ante</em> disclosure.&nbsp; Instead, there is  a single, voluntary, up-front decision by each participant whether or not to  agree to a unitary set of licensing terms.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Unfortunately, this  mechanism is not suitable for situations in which the participation of a broad  array of stakeholders is required, and the value of the standards to be  developed has low importance to some of those stakeholders.&nbsp; Were the same commitment to be required of  all, some categories of participants whose input or support is crucial would  simply not join.&nbsp; The result is often  that a more lenient, RAND-oriented IPR policy is adopted instead.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>The open source project:</em></strong>&nbsp; The greatly accelerating popularity of open  source software has brought added urgency not only to royalty-free licensing  commitments, but also to agreeing to forego a variety of other otherwise  acceptable licensing terms.&nbsp; While  originally a commitment to such terms arose only as a result of participating  in such a project, the proliferation of open source software has put pressure on  software-developing SSOs to adopt IPR policies that permit implementation of  their standards in open source software.&nbsp;  Once again, adoption of such a policy can remove the need for <em>ex ante</em> disclosure of licensing terms entirely, if instead a commitment is made to  provide a license on the open source (GPL or other) terms required.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Permitted or required implementer license terms:</em></strong>&nbsp; There are a  number of specific terms that are commonly explicitly permitted by IPR policies  as being consistent with a RAND licensing obligation, and those with Necessary  Claims could be required or permitted, as part of the standing IPR policy, to  include such terms in their license agreements.&nbsp; These terms include:</p>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Defensive suspension:</em></strong>&nbsp; Under       this term, an implementer that sues another implementer for infringement       of its own Necessary Claim(s) may have its implementation license revoked,       thus providing a negative incentive to sue, and, if the licensee has sued       the owner of another Necessary Claim(s), leveling the playing field       between the parties in the infringement litigation.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Reciprocity:</em></strong>&nbsp; While       less often used than the defensive suspension, some SSOs permit the owner       of a Necessary Claim to require a license back of any Necessary Claims of       an implementer.&nbsp; Sometimes this       license extends to all other implementers (member and non-member alike),       resulting in an expanding IPR safety zone.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="style2"><strong><em>Detailed assertion forms:</em></strong>&nbsp; Many       consortia require their members (or at least those involved in a specific       development working group) to use, uniform, detailed response forms prior       to the adoption of a standard.&nbsp;       These forms not only require that the member state whether it will       or will not license on RAND terms, but whether or not it will require       payment of a royalty.&nbsp; They also       typically require identification of the specific claims that the member       believes are Necessary Claims (and even, in a more general way, any claims       under non-public patent applications), and the section of the draft       standard to which each Necessary Claim relates.&nbsp; As a result, other members can evaluate whether they agree       with the infringement assertion, and if so, to assess the feasibility of       designing around the infringement.&nbsp;       Thus, while the exact amount of any royalty is not disclosed, a       member is permitted to disclose that no royalty at all will be required, providing       a clear advantage to including the Necessary Claims of that member over       those of another member that has reserved the right to charge for its       patent claims.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Other prospective  options:</em></strong>&nbsp; In addition to those alternatives that have  already been implemented, there are others that could be imagined that could be  deployed in order to increase certainty and lower implementation costs.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Overall royalty caps:</em></strong>&nbsp; One mechanism that is currently under  discussion (in addition to <em>ex ante</em> alternatives) is the imposition of a  cap on royalties by the SSO in which a standard is developed.&nbsp; In effect, this would represent the merging  of the concept of a patent pool with the development process itself, with the  total royalty being set in advance, rather than as a result of an agreement  reached outside of the SSO during, or after, the standards development process  is complete.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Nominally, such a procedure  would solve all of the same problems that <em>ex ante</em> disclosure and  negotiations could achieve, and with greater up-front certainty.&nbsp; If the mechanics of a patent pool were also  to follow (whether within or outside the SSO), implementers would also benefit  from needing to enter into a single license covering all Necessary Claims, rather  than negotiating and entering into multiple, unique licenses with each  Necessary Claim owner.&nbsp; Finally,  non-discriminatory licensing would be far easier to ensure.</p>
                  <p class="style2">Conceivably, such a plan  would also increase the likelihood that more owners of Necessary Claims would  enter the patent pool, since only by participation could a patent owner  influence the inclusion of its patent in the resulting standard.</p>
                  <p class="style2">There are, inevitably,  disadvantages to such an approach as well.&nbsp;  First, the owners of likely Necessary Claims would need to not only be  members, but would also need to conclude that they would in fact be better off  being bound by the royalty cap obligation than staying outside the process, in  order to retain the right to levy a higher tax on implementation.&nbsp; Further, managing a patent pool-like  situation requires a far greater degree of attention to antitrust risks than  would providing for a simple voluntary <em>ex ante</em> disclosure option, as  well as ongoing administrative tasks (although these could be outsourced).&nbsp; As a result, the degree of infrastructure,  management, legal attention other requirements may result in few SSOs in fact  having the appetite to be innovators in this regard.</p>
                  <p class="style2">In fact, a proposal for some  type of royalty cap mechanism was proposed last year by a group of mobile  operator members in ETSI, in reaction to their perception that royalty demands  had gotten out of hand.&nbsp; However, as of  this writing it appears that discussion within ETSI is focusing now on the  possible adoption of rules that would permit <em>ex ante</em> disclosure rather  than the imposition of royalty caps.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">25</a></p>
                  <p class="style2">Nevertheless, such a concept  does have merit, and in some respects would involve less risk than would novel <em>ex  ante</em> mechanisms, given the fact that antitrust regulators have issued  advisory opinions in the past on the structure and operations of patent pools,  providing a useful reservoir of guidance upon which SSOs could draw in  designing their own procedures.</p>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Defining reasonability:</em></strong>&nbsp; Another alternative would be for an SSO to  define what &quot;reasonable&quot; means in the context of a patent  royalty.&nbsp; While not offering the  security of a total royalty cap for all Necessary Claims on a single standard,  members could agree on a standard formula to value Necessary Claims that would  then operate automatically, thus ensuring a maximum economic burden per claim  without the requirement of discussion.&nbsp;  Such a formula could take into account the total number of claims  asserted, automatically decreasing the maximum allowed per claim as the number  of claims increased.&nbsp; As there would be  no requirement that any patent owner would be required to become a member, or  if a member, to actually participate in a given working group, antitrust  concerns would be reduced, although not eliminated.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Establishing terms: </em></strong>&nbsp;An SSO could also further define the  non-economic terms that an implementer license could include, or even mandate  the exact language of a set of terms that such a license would be required to  use if the Necessary Claims owner wished to include those types of terms  generically.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong>&nbsp; The current  debate over <em>ex ante</em> alternatives has suffered to a degree from being  addressed in a vacuum, without regard (on the one hand) to all of the existing  issues outside of the standard setting process itself that it could help  resolve, or (on the other hand) to the other methods that could also be  considered to achieve similar ends.&nbsp;  Similarly, proponents of <em>ex ante</em> process additions have not  always appreciated some of the complexity and risk that could be involved with <em>ex  ante </em>disclosure and/ornegotiations, while the opponents have  painted an unduly dire picture of the risks of even simple disclosure  proposals, and ignored the fact that more challenging programs, such as patent  pools, already exist and operate without frequent calamitous antitrust  consequences.</p>
                  <p class="style2">It is to be hoped that one  or more SSOs will in fact implement an <em>ex ante</em> disclosure program in the  near future, and obtain a business review letter or advisory opinion from the  antitrust regulators to provide a degree of comfort, not only for their  members, but for the standard setting community at large.&nbsp; Once SSOs and their members gain experience  with designing and operating such programs, confidence will grow, and the  benefits of this logical and innovative concept, conjoined with other existing  and new techniques, will presumably spread.</p>

              <p class="style2">                There are, I think, two logical explanations.&nbsp; One is  relatively straightforward,&nbsp;while the other represents a convoluted and little-discussed  weakness in the traditional way of creating standards.&nbsp; In  this&nbsp;entry, I'll describe both possible explanations,&nbsp;but I'm betting  that the convoluted alternative will&nbsp;prove to be the explanation for what  is happening here.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Let's knock off the easy explanation first, which relates to  exactly what it is that Microsoft would like to license from Adobe.&nbsp; At  one end of the spectrum, Microsoft may only be interested in licensing  those&nbsp;Adobe patent claims that would&nbsp;be infringed if Microsoft were to  write software&nbsp;to implement the PDF specifications that have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A">adopted  as standards</a> by ISO/IEC.&nbsp; Next up the value chain would be  wanting to license the actual code that Adobe itself uses in Acrobat to&nbsp;save  documents in the PDF format (not too likely a scenario, given that Microsoft  has written a few lines of code&nbsp;itself over the years).&nbsp; And finally  there would be a Microsoft request to license the rights to include additional  features in Vista that are included in Acrobat, but which are not described in  the ISO/IEC standard.&nbsp; Such &quot;<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060605074812177">proprietary extensions</a>,&quot; as I  discussed in my last blog entry,&nbsp;can be quite desirable - as Microsoft is  well aware.</p>
              <p class="style2">                In the first case, Adobe would have an obligation to license the  patent claims to Microsoft on RAND terms (on which more below).&nbsp; But in  the latter two cases, Adobe would be fully justified in imposing whatever unique  requirements it wished on the extra code and/or patents, as the case may be,  since it is not bound by the specific undertakings it&nbsp;entered into with <a href="http://aiim.org/standards.asp?ID=25013">AIIM&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(the actual standards body that described  and adopted the PDF elements that it then submitted to ISO/IEC) with respect to  actual code or any additional functionalities. </p>
              <p class="style2">                So  the first possibility is simply that Microsoft wants more than&nbsp;Adobe is  required to&nbsp;give it under its standards-related undertakings.</p>
              <p class="style2">                This possibility underlines the difference between a <em>de facto</em> standard and a <em>de jure</em> standard.&nbsp;Broadly stated, a&nbsp;<em>de  facto </em>standard describes something that&nbsp;the market has overwhelmingly  decided that&nbsp;it wants to use in order to achieve the same result as an  official standard (such as&nbsp;the interoperability that exists among users of  Windows and applications that run on Windows).&nbsp; Such a <em>de facto</em> standard can deliver a degree of interoperability that is far superior to that  achieved by <em>de jure</em> standards, but at a cost:&nbsp; with a <em>de  facto</em> standard,&nbsp;everything is&nbsp;controlled by a single vendor (or  group of vendors).</p>
              <p class="style2">                In the case of PDF,&nbsp;there is, in effect, a <em>de jure</em> standard (ISO PDF) nested within a <em>de facto</em> standard, the latter being  the Adobe Acrobat product with its added features.&nbsp; Another example of the  same situation would be Microsoft Office, in comparison to Open XML if it is  approved by Ecma and ISO/IEC.&nbsp; Anyone would be free to implement Open XML  (just as anyone can implement ISO PDF, whether Adobe likes it or not), but they  would not be free to simply reverse engineer and sell Office (or  Acrobat)&nbsp;in its entirety. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Now let's look at the second possibility, which is that Microsoft  and Adobe are arguing about exactly what terms Adobe is obligated to offer to  Microsoft, in these specific circumstances,&nbsp;under a typical  &quot;RAND&quot; licensing obligation.</p>
              <p class="style2">                RAND stands for &quot;<strong>R</strong>easonable <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>N</strong>on-<strong>D</strong>iscriminatory&quot; (in Europe, an &quot;F,&quot; for  &quot;Fair,&quot; is often added, without really changing the meaning).&nbsp;  When a participant in a standards process agrees to RAND licensing, that  obligation relates to&nbsp;any patent claims it owns that would be infringed by  an implementation of the standard in question.&nbsp;The obligation itself has  three principle elements: to provide a license&nbsp;to these patent  claims&nbsp;to everyone that requests a license, to provide that license on  reasonable terms, and to ensure that the terms one implementer are the  same&nbsp;as&nbsp;those that are offered to every other implementer under  substantially the same circumstances.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Sort of.</p>
              <p class="style2">The reason for the &quot;sort of&quot; is that while  &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory&quot; sounds all very fine and clear,  exactly what that phrase means is in fact never strictly spelled out, and would  be difficult to impossible to define with precision in any event.&nbsp; What,  for example, is &quot;reasonable?&quot;&nbsp; Would a reasonable royalty under  a standard be lower, because of the volume that will result from wide adoption  of the standard, allowing a handsome profit even if the per-product rate was  low, or higher, because of the value that standardization provides to the  licensee on top of the normal value of a patent license?&nbsp; And would it be  reasonable for a patent owner to require an implementer to provide a license  back to the licensor to any of the implementer's own patent claims that would  be infringed by an implementation of the standard?&nbsp; Historically, the answer to this last question has been  &quot;yes&quot; - but that was before open source licensing began to  proliferate.&nbsp; If the standard was  relevant to open source software, then the answer from the open source  community would be a resounding &quot;no!&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">                The meaning of &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; is even more  difficult to nail down, for the same reason&nbsp;that a &quot;most favored  nation&quot; clause in a legal contract is hard to define (and therefore  enforce).&nbsp;&nbsp; Under a most favored nations clause, a vendor (for  example) agrees that if it ever gives another customer a better deal under  &quot;substantially similar circumstances,&quot; the contract will  automatically readjust to give the same deal to the &quot;most favored&quot;  customer.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                But what does that really mean?&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;could  someone under a RAND obligation (or a most favored nation clause) charge a  lower royalty per unit from someone that orders 100,000 units than one that  orders 1,000 (pretty clearly yes, in the most favored nation clause  example)?&nbsp; How about 90,000 units?&nbsp; What if they both order 100,000  units, but one is an OEM and the other isn't?&nbsp; Or if they are both the  same, but one agrees to include mention of the vendor's product in&nbsp;a  national marketing campaign?&nbsp; And how about if there is an&nbsp;underlying  patent cross license between the vendor (or RAND patent owner) and one party,  and not the other?&nbsp; Could the patent owner under the RAND obligation  charge the person ordering only 1,000 units no royalty at all?&nbsp; In short,  are any of these factual settings really &quot;substantially  similar?&quot;&nbsp; Or are they sufficiently  &quot;dissimilar&quot; to justify offering different terms in each case?&nbsp; And if so, is there any limit on how  different they can be?</p>
              <p class="style2">                If in fact Microsoft is only interested in the ISO/IEC elements of  the PDF product, then this is what I assume Adobe is relying on to justify its  refusal to provide a free license.&nbsp;  After all, in the real world of bundled functionalities there can  be&nbsp;as many&nbsp;apples to oranges comparisons as apples to apples.&nbsp;  Perhaps there's an existing agreement between Microsoft and Adobe that  Microsoft wants&nbsp;to modify at the same time, and Adobe is tying that  negotiation to the PDF negotiation, attempting to take it outside its RAND obligation.&nbsp;  Or perhaps Adobe is saying that the Vista situation is different than the  OpenOffice.org arrangement in some as-yet undisclosed way.&nbsp; Or perhaps  Adobe is saying that asking Microsoft to charge more is &quot;reasonable&quot;  - after all, it doesn't appear that Adobe is asking that Microsoft pay  anything, just that Microsoft make a bigger profit (what could be unreasonable  about that?)</p>
              <p class="style2">                The reason that this type of ambiguity represents a weakness in  the standards system is that there's no easy way to resolve a dispute if an  implementer believes (or suspects) that it is being treated unreasonably or  discriminatorily. Standard setting organizations don't have the budget or  resources to act as arbitrators to settle disputes, and therefore refuse to do  so.&nbsp; And the implementer never knows what kind of a deal another  implementer got in any event, because the vendor has no obligation to disclose  those terms or report back to the standards organization on whether or not it  is meeting its RAND obligations.</p>
              <p class="style2">                This sort of dispute would easily explain two things:&nbsp; how  Microsoft and Adobe could have negotiated for four months over something that  should have been automatic, and how Adobe could have felt safe digging in even  though it is under a RAND obligation.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Is this in fact what is going on?&nbsp;  We may&nbsp;never find out, since it appears that Adobe is not in fact  planning to file a complaint with the European Commission after all.&nbsp; Late  yesterday, according to <a href="http://www.connectitnews.com/story.cfm?item=3269">ConnectIT.news</a>, Adobe made its first&nbsp;statement&nbsp;on  this topic:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">&quot;As a matter of  policy we do not comment on discussions with customers, partners or  competitors,&quot; stated Adobe officially in an email via its public relations  company. </p>
                <p class="style2">&quot;However, in  response to allegations made by Microsoft to the press, Adobe has made no  determination to take legal action against Microsoft. Further, with regard to  any discussions we have had with Microsoft about Office and Vista, our sole  motivation is to maintain a fair, competitive landscape in the software  industry,&quot; Adobe added. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                Interestingly, I haven't been able to confirm this Adobe statement  anywhere else on the Web.&nbsp; But if this&nbsp;report is accurate, it fits  the second alternative scenario perfectly.<strong> </strong></p>

              <p><span class="style56"><em>#39</em></span><strong class="style38"><em> Evolution, Standards, and Open Source  </em></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">As long-time Consortium  Standards Bulletin readers will be aware, the <em>Consider This</em> essay is the  part of the CSB where I allow myself to range as freely as I wish across the  standards landscape (<em>very</em> broadly construed), utilizing the concept of  the standard as a vehicle rather than chafing under it as a constraint.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">While many <em>Consider This</em> essays have in fact addressed traditional standards topics, others have ranged  as far afield as the flatness of Kansas, using pancakes as the  &quot;standard&quot; of flatness (<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/blog.php?ID=3">Standards, Similes, Pancakes  and Kansas</a>), Internet conspiracy theorists and RFID chips (<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/blog.php?ID=14">Dan Mullen, Andrew  Jackson, and the Dark Side of the Internet</a>), nationalism and food standards  (<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/blog.php?ID=21">Soy Sauce, Kimche  and the Golden Rule</a>), and, more recently, the thickening of Americans and  resulting need to update the dimensions of the &quot;standard American&quot; as  used by engineers (<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/blog.php?ID=36">Body  Type Standards, Crash Test Dummies, and Sleeping with Big Agnes</a>).</p>
              <p class="style2">As a result, I feel on  fairly safe historical grounds in offering the following proposition this  month, as we approach the November elections: </p>
              <p class="style2">Evolution has seen fit to  develop in the human species two standardized, instinctive approaches to  dealing with society, which in America we call the &quot;Republican&quot; and  &quot;Democrat&quot; approaches, one of which or the other great majority of  Americans resonate with, regardless of whether they consider themselves to be a  formal member of the party identified by that name.</p>
              <p class="style2">From the process point of  view, the evolution of these two standardized ways of dealing with the  competing priorities of self and society represents the longest running open  source project in human history. </p>
              <p class="style2">Let's cover the easiest part  first.&nbsp; Are political affiliations &ndash; or,  more properly, those specific underlying characteristics commonly that we lump  together as being either &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;&nbsp; - the result of nature or nurture?&nbsp; If not nature, then how does one explain the  fact that two equally intelligent people, often raised in the same household,  can hold such diametrically opposed and comparably deep-seated convictions,  each firmly convinced that they are possessed of revealed truth?</p>
              <p class="style2">I would submit (in all  seriousness) that it is highly likely that it is genetic predisposition and not  life experience that has led to both the instinctive depth of feeling as well  as the dichotomy.&nbsp; In support of that  conclusion I would offer that there are so many different aspects of human and  animal behavior that are clearly hardwired (from the flight response, to the  urge to protect one's children at the expense of one's own welfare, to the  building of distinctive nest shapes by different species of birds), that there  is little reason to assume that conservatism and liberalism should be any  different.</p>
              <p class="style2">In fact, I would go further  to observe that the stereotypical outlooks of conservatives (take care of  yourself; resist impositions on personal freedoms and high taxes) and liberals  (take care of everyone; accept impositions on personal freedom and higher taxes  in exchange for promoting the welfare of society) are each perfectly viable  survival strategies, and hence unlikely to have developed into two such  pervasive and ongoing outlooks in the absence of a clear relation to survival.</p>
              <p class="style2">But if this were true, why  would taking care of others (what environmental theorists refer to as  &quot;altruism&quot;) represent a survival skill?</p>
              <p class="style2">This quandary has been a  matter of debate for evolutionary theorists for some time.&nbsp; The arguments supporting altruism as a  survival strategy were perhaps best summarized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, a  brilliant Oxford don with a flair for making complex scientific theories  accessible to the layman.&nbsp; In his  seminal work of 1976 titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199291152/qid=1151574520/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/104-4467654-8316758?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">The  Selfish Gene</a>, he explicated the concept that all life forms exist for the  sole purpose of transporting their genes down through time, making you and I  akin to self-centered drivers that are oblivious to the fact that we are simply  taxi drivers that have forgotten about the passengers in the back seat.</p>
              <p class="style2">Although the selfish gene  theory, when stated so bluntly, sounds both absurd as well as disquieting, it  is downright spooky how accurately it predicts all aspects of human behavior &ndash;  including altruism, particularly as regards the protection of close relations  in addition to immediate family members.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                Returning to conservatism  and liberalism, then, how can these two very different outlooks each be  explained in evolutionary terms, and in particular, how do we explain an urge  to take care of someone outside of our family (i.e., our immediate gene pool?)</p>
              <p class="style2">Dealing with conservatism  first, it is easy to understand that taking care of oneself and one's family is  mostly likely to result in genetic continuation.&nbsp; And, in fact, it is only slightly less intuitive to reflect that  there would be many situations over the course of evolution under which one's  personal survival might be dependent on the survival of the tribe, band or clan  in which one lives.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">But assuming that this is a  sound conclusion, why would nature preserve two strategies in the long term  instead of one?&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">The evolutionary theorist  would respond that a single strategy would only make sense under constant  conditions.&nbsp; Because there is little  that is constant, either in the near term (plenty and famine, flood and drought)  or in the long term (global climatic shifts), a species with only a single,  highly refined survival strategy is vulnerable to be exterminated when  conditions change such that the strategy no longer works.</p>
              <p class="style2">As an example of conditions  that could select to conservatism or liberalism, one could observe that in  times of famine, watching out for one's own could be the best strategy, while  in times of drought, only the collective might of a band might secure rights at  a water hole, and later in evolution, survival during time of tribal war would  be dependent on being part of an internally loyal and strong defensive  force.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Similarly, for  hunter-gatherers, members of a tribe enduring a time of want in one area might  only survive if they have maintained cordial relations with adjacent bands,  each of which is entitled to rely on the other in times of need.&nbsp; While one strategy may be superior for a  while, with the result that one type of behavior begins to manifest itself more  frequently in the gene pool, eventually conditions change.&nbsp; In that case, but for the remaining  reservoir of genes favoring the opposing behavior, it might go badly indeed for  the survival of the species.&nbsp; Given the  vicissitudes of environment and human aggression, both behaviors doubtless  remain about equally viable at any point in time.</p>
              <p class="style2">As a result (except at  cocktail parties), society generally benefits from the perpetuation of two  strategies rather than one, albeit at the expense of a certain amount of  stomach lining.&nbsp; Sometimes, two  standards really are better than one.&nbsp;  They can even lead to the evolution of new parasitic species, such as  lobbyists, talk radio hosts, and authors of political rant books.</p>
              <p class="style2">Having made, I hope, my  first point, let me turn to my second contention.&nbsp; If indeed we have evolved two biological standards of political  outlook, is this result in fact the product of a biological open source  project?</p>
              <p class="style2">I think so.&nbsp; Let's compare what makes an open source  project what it is with how the human race (or any other species) evolves in  the wild, and see if you agree, using a simple table to make the point.</p>

              <p class="style2">.&nbsp; <br>
  So, as you can see, if  conservatives and liberals can be fairly seen as naturally evolved standards  (or, better yet, as living, breathing reference implementations of these  standards), then the process by which they have been created &ndash; and by means of  which they continue to be modified &ndash; seems to be very like an open source  project.</p>
              <p class="style2">Of course, the analogy can  be taken too far.&nbsp; Still, it is  interesting to note just how far it can be taken, because apparently the same  sensible rules that make evolution a successful process also work in a consciously  collaborative environment.</p>
              <p class="style2">All of which demonstrates  yet another example of fractalism in nature, as something as seemingly modern,  synthetic and intellectualized as standards and open source development seem,  after all, to be but unconsciously derivative human replications of timeless  evolutionary processes. </p>

RuBee is a bidirectional,  on-demand, peer-to-peer, radiating, transceiver protocol operating at  wavelengths below 450 Khz. This protocol works in harsh environments with  networks of many thousands of tags and has an area range of 10 to 50 feet. One  of the advantages of long-wavelength technology is that the radio tags can be  low in cost, near credit card thin (1.5 mm), and fully programmable using 4 bit  processors. Despite their high functionality, RuBee radio tags have a proven  battery life of ten years or more using low-cost, coin-size lithium  batteries.... <a href="http://www.mobiletechnews.com/info/2006/06/09/112723.html">...Full Story</a></p>

While it's already possible to tailor Web pages to mobile  devices using CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), there's no way of taking account of  the differing capabilities of different handhelds, such as screen size, color  or resolution. DIAL allows people to specify different layouts for various  devices.

I believe that the 2006 WWW conference  in Edinburgh, just completed, will be seen as the turning point for the SW - as  indicated by the extensive and complimentary press that the conference  received, little of which doubted the inevitability of SW uptake.</em> </p></td>

                <strong>ANSI.org June 15, 2006</strong>&nbsp;The Consumer Policy Committee of the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO COPOLCO) is calling for the  development of an International Standard that would provide guidance on how to  identify, assess and eliminate or reduce risks associated with consumer  products to all those involved in the supply chain. According to COPOLCO, such  a standard is needed because regulatory authorities and standards writing  bodies cannot keep up with the rapid pace of global change in product design,  construction and materials and thereby ensure that appropriate safety  requirements are in place. <a href="http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=1245">...Full  Story</a></p>

                <strong>MobileTechNews June 10, 2006</strong>&nbsp;Piscataway, NJ -- The IEEE has begun  work on a new standard, IEEE P1902.1(TM), which will improve upon the  visibility network protocol known as RuBee(TM). RuBee is a bidirectional,  on-demand, peer-to-peer, radiating, transceiver protocol operating at  wavelengths below 450 Khz. This protocol works in harsh environments with  networks of many thousands of tags and has an area range of 10 to 50 feet. One  of the advantages of long-wavelength technology is that the radio tags can be  low in cost, near credit card thin (1.5 mm), and fully programmable using 4 bit  processors. Despite their high functionality, RuBee radio tags have a proven  battery life of ten years or more using low-cost, coin-size lithium  batteries.... <a href="http://www.mobiletechnews.com/info/2006/06/09/112723.html">...Full Story</a></p>
