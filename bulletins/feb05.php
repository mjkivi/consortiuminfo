                <p align="left" class="style2"> As our latest contribution to that field of study, we proudly announce the public launch of a major new research resource: the Standards MetaLibrary. The MetaLibrary is the most comprehensive access point to the literature of standard setting on the Web, and joins the other unique resources of ConsortiumInfo.org: the most complete listing of consortia and the standards they create, a daily feed of standards news of all types, the only monthly journal on standards in publication today, and much more. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In our Editorial this month, we place the MetaLibrary in the context of both traditional research methods and the new capabilities (and challenges) of on-line search, noting that without resources such as the MetaLibrary, it is easier to drown in than relish the wealth of data now available on the Web. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In our Feature Article, we propose that the broad range of &quot;commonalities&quot; (not just formal standards, but all consensus-based tools) that have been utilized throughout the history of humanity represents an important and under-examined field of study - a state of affairs that we hope the Standards MetaLibrary will help to correct. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> In the following article, we provide the details behind the Standards MetaLibrary - what it is, how it can be used, and how it came into being. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> And in our Blog entry for this month, we explore how the parameters of another type of commonalities -- musical instruments &ndash; can provide a balance between strict design parameters and room for innovation, as personified by that unique addition to the jazz, rock and gospel instrumental arsenal, the venerable Hammond B-3 Organ. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> As we do most months, we wrap up with what we think were the most interesting news items that crossed our virtual desk in the month just ended. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"> As always, we hope you enjoy this issue. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">&nbsp;</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">If one were to compare the ten-year lifetime of the Web with the entire history of humanity, it would represent but the proverbial blink of an eye. But in that comparative instant, the information accessible to anyone with a computer and a broadband connection point has expanded by almost uncountable orders of magnitude. In these last few years, we have experienced a veritable &quot;Big Bang&quot; of information access. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> But how does one cope with such an explosion of available information? The Googles and Yahoos of the world are doing yeoman service in their efforts to create search tools that will yield useful results. But the success of these efforts is increasing at merely sonic speed, while the envelope of web-accessible information that surrounds us continues to expand at the speed of light. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> So how can we cope with this surfeit of riches? Perhaps the ultimate answer will lie not with more sophisticated search-based presentation of available information, but with a return to old fashioned, value added aggregation. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Today, the Web is like a well-endowed museum of natural history that acquires vast amounts of material, much of which is never indexed at all. Such a museum fails to achieve a balance between raw aggregation and useful presentation. Instead, it functions more like someone on a buying spree that buys more clothes than can actually be worn. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> But unlike a museum, where much material disappears into locked drawers or remains boxed in warehouses, the Web allows us to bump around in the basement amid the unlabeled boxes as well as among the well-lit display cases, and to stumble unknowingly from one extreme to the other as we scroll endlessly down the page. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> For all of recorded history, both aggregation and presentation have gone hand in hand in order to serve the needs of those desiring to access the wisdom of others. Libraries, after all, are simply aggregators of recorded material of various types. But unlike museums, libraries traditionally only acquire what they are willing and able to index and display. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Most libraries exist for generalist purposes, ranging from local libraries (at the modest end of the spectrum) to the United States Library of Congress (at the opposite extreme). But there are also a multitude of specialized libraries, focusing on subject areas such as music, law, medicine, theology and countless other domains. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Those who manage these specialist libraries dedicate their available resources towards specialized aggregation with the goal of offering as much as possible within a discrete subject area to an equally circumscribed audience, rather than seeking to provide something for everyone (and less of anything in particular for anyone with a specific interest). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Of course, useful aggregation involves not only acquisition within defined parameters, but applying standards of quality and relevance as well. It may also require tailored presentation, if the materials acquired are to be optimally useful. The results of well-conceived, financed and curated aggregation projects are information resources that attract visitors from all over the world. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> How much should the advent of the Internet and the Web affect historical research methods? Most obviously, by allowing anyone to visit virtually what before could only be accessed physically. While there are troublesome issues that arise (will what I link to today still be there tomorrow?), the opportunities far outstrip the restrictions. Still, the concept of the &quot;insurmountable opportunity&quot; has perhaps never been more truly illustrated than by the enormity of the resources available on the Web. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Now that the Big Bang has occurred, we believe that it is therefore not less important, but more so to preserve the concept of aggregation. At least until such time (if ever) as search algorithms can be devised that can find just what is needed, and nothing else, aggregators that not only narrow the funnel but vet what is allowed to pass through it will provide an invaluable service. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> It is therefore with great satisfaction that we announce in this issue the public launch of the <strong><em>Standards MetaLibrary</em></strong> -- our latest contribution to the world of standards. Made possible with the continuing support of Gesmer Updegrove LLP and a generous grant from Sun Microsystems, Inc., the mission of the Standards MetaLibrary is to identify, index and make available all of the scholarship that has been linked to the Web in the field of standards. We hope that you find it useful, and use it often. </p>

              <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style71">Introduction:</span></em></strong><span class="style2"> It has become well recognized that many subjects can most productively be examined through the lens of more than a single discipline. More may be drawn from a piece of 18 th century literature (for example) when it is studied in the context of the times and the society in which it was written than from a purely aesthetic point of view. Similarly, additional insight can be gained into the history of a prior time period by examining its literature. Again, that same literature (or history) may be examined from an economic or even an ideological perspective to make additional connections. In this article, we advocate applying the same approach in order to best study the significance of what we refer to as &ldquo;commonalities&rdquo;. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style71">Commonalities as a worthy subject of study.</span></em></strong> Our definition of &ldquo;commonalities&rdquo; is this: &ldquo;Whatever tool we need -- that we need to agree on -- that is necessary to get the job done.&rdquo; The three essential features of a commonality are best examined in opposite order. Stated in another way, they are: </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> 1. A desired and beneficial goal. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> 2. Recognition that in order to achieve that goal, the agreement of multiple parties will be required. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> 3. A mutually agreeable and appropriate mechanism that can be used to achieve the goal. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> The earliest known examples of commonalities include language, weights and measures and monetary systems. Some of these commonalities (e.g., language) evolved organically and continue to develop in the same fashion, while others (such as weights and measures) with time became codified locally or regionally, and eventually were superseded globally with more coherent constructs (e.g., the metric system). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Today, voluntary consensus standards are by far the most numerous examples of commonalities. But by limiting academic study to standards (as commonly defined), it is possible to miss many of the attributes of commonalities that are most interesting and worthy of examination. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Some of these attributes are the following: </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style71">Their relationship to the human condition:</span></em></strong> The development and use of commonalities (in the form of language &ndash; spoken and signed) have existed from the very dawn of human consciousness. Commonalities are not only ancient, but also universal (at least in concept), arising in comparable forms in myriad cultures across the world and throughout time. The continuous development and use of commonalities therefore appears to be intrinsic to the very concept of being human, and more particularly of being a social being. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Pervasiveness:</span></em></strong> There is no end to the variety of commonalities that have been developed over time, beginning with language, but becoming increasingly diverse and refined with the passage of time. By the definition offered above, commonalities also include musical instruments that have evolved to offer precise voices (e.g., violin, viola, cello, and bass) to fulfill very specialized roles in particular types of music. The result of such standardization permits music to be created and played over time and across international boundaries with predictable results. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Voluntary consensus:</span></em></strong> In a world rife with conflict and oppressive governments, it is in many ways remarkable that formal, modern standards are as pervasive as they are, each one created through a formal process. Huge corporations, government agencies, universities and individuals from around the world participate in these processes voluntarily, and then implement the resulting standards of their own volition as well. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Flexibility:</span></em></strong> The variety and ubiquity of commonalities is endlessly apparent, demonstrating not only the utility of the concept, but also its extensibility. In addition to musical instruments, one could add further examples as diverse as literary conventions (from the Greek Chorus to the Japanese Haiku), to the designation of time zones. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Ability to continuously evolve:</span></em></strong> New types of commonalities are emerging all of the time. Recent examples include open source software, and the Creative Commons copyright concept. Each of these examples, in turn, has its own tailored variations and is the subject of continuing evolution. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Durability:</span></em></strong> While new types of commonalities are being developed on a constant basis, others have existed for thousands of years and are still in use, such as the concept of weights and measures. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Challenges:</span></em></strong> At the same time, commonalities, by their nature, have their own limitations, such as the phenomenon of &ldquo;lock in&rdquo;. For example, someone raised in the English system of weights and measures is apt to find metric measures to be less than intuitive. And just as it is awkward and inconvenient to emigrate and face the need to learn a new language, so also is it expensive and tedious to migrate from one proprietary computer operating system to another. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong></strong><span class="style71">Rewards from the study of commonalities:</span></em></strong> After the rich diversity and importance of commonalities is recognized, it is easy to imagine a broad range of topics worth studying. The following is a sampling: </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Robustness:</span></em></strong> Political systems continue to suffer from instability and abuse in many countries around the world, with democracies as well as autocracies frequently being subverted by one faction or another. In contrast, the standard setting process (while also often abused) nevertheless typically continues to function usefully. What are the aspects of the standard setting process that result in stability and the ability of opposing factions to agree? And are any of these aspects transferable into national, regional, or global governmental processes? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style71">Economic value:</span></em></strong> Data regarding the economic value of standard setting is surprisingly sparse. And yet when such studies are conducted, the results can be dramatic. The United States National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) has conducted such analyses on occasion, and the results have never failed to be startling. In one recent <a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2004_0830.htm#software" target="_off">study</a>, NIST found that the absence of adequate software interoperability in non-residential American buildings cost over $15.8 billion dollars in lost efficiency in 2002 alone. What are the areas that could benefit most from the development and application of standards, and how can this process best be facilitated? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style71">Optimization:</span></em></strong> Given the value of standards, how could the standard setting process within existing organizations be optimized to make it more efficient and effective? With new types of technical challenges to address and new stakeholders expressing interests in results, how should old techniques adjust to address new realities? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style71">Coordination:</span></em></strong> The same forces that are rendering standards more important are also exposing the limitations of the existing standard setting infrastructure. With the convergence not just of information technology and communications technology, but of disciplines as diverse as nanotechnology and life sciences, how should that infrastructure evolve, and how should the various existing and new nodes in this system best coordinate their efforts to maximal benefit? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style71">Consumer interests:</span></em></strong> Does the current standard setting infrastructure adequately serve consumer interests, or does it serve users only to the extent that it also advances the interests of other stakeholders (and particularly vendors)? If the latter, how can this deficit best be addressed? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style71">Conscious evolution:</span></em></strong> The development of new types of commonalities tends to be organic rather than deliberate, at the institutional level (the development of open source being an obvious example). Perhaps just as biotechnology is learning to work at the genetic level, the process of creating new types of commonalities, and the processes for creating them, could be more deliberately conceived as well. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style10">Government support:</span></em></strong> What is the ideal relationship between voluntary consensus standards and government? How can governments best support standard setting (from a policy, economic and participatory perspective), and how can the standard setting process best support the needs and priorities of government, in its role as servant of the public interest, and also as a consumer of goods and services? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style71">Social Policy:</span></em></strong> As the Web and the Internet play a greater and greater role in society, commerce and education, how should its evolution and operation be managed and governed? Should the standards that enable these vital resources continue to develop within self-selected and independent standards bodies, or should the services that they make possible be considered to be akin to utilities, and be subjected to regulation in the same fashion as electricity? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style71">Sociology:</span></em></strong> What does the process of commonality creation (both organic as well as formal) tell us about how people think and interact? What does this particular exercise, viewed in microcosm, tell us about other ways in which people interact? Are their lessons that can be learned from human behavior in standard setting that could productively be applied elsewhere, and vice versa? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong><span class="style71">Governance:</span></em></strong> What can the ability of competitors to agree in a single standard setting process, and of national standard setting bodies to collaborate in global associations, teach us about governance structures? What are the aspects of these processes that permit this result, and can they be applied in governmental and other contexts to advantage? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style71">Conclusions:</span></em></strong> While standards and standard setting have not been wholly ignored as a subject of scholarship, it is our view that they have to date failed to attract either the degree of attention, or the level of appreciation that they merit. Further, we believe that there is a depth of meaning and a breadth of opportunity to learn lessons from commonalities that exceeds the traditional boundaries within which they have been viewed. The time is ripe for standards to be recognized as a multi-faceted field of study where much remains to be done, and even more of value remains to be learned. </p>

                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style71"><em> What is the Standards MetaLibrary?</em></strong> Just as &ldquo;meta information&rdquo; is &ldquo;information about information&rdquo; and not useful data in its own right, and &ldquo;metatags&rdquo; are hidden codes that help a browser find a specific webpage, a &ldquo;metalibrary&rdquo; is a means to an end, and not the end in itself. In this case, the MetaLibrary is a research tool comprising an ever-increasing number of carefully indexed, sortable and searchable abstracts (705, as of the launch date) of articles about standards. Each abstract is linked to the full text of the article at its host site. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"> The Standards MetaLibrary is not limited to material about standards in a narrow sense. Rather, it focuses on the importance of standards to the modern world and their impact on society, and how they are created, and by whom. The materials included therefore address topics such as how the standard setting process operates, how governments support this process and utilize standards, the economic benefits of standards uptake, legal aspects of the use (and abuse) of standards, and many other subjects that illustrate the role of standards in the world today. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style71">Why is there a need for a Standards MetaLibrary?</span></em></strong> There are four principal reasons why we have created, and why Sun Microsystems has supported (Sun provided a generous development grant), the Standards MetaLibrary: </p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <ul>
                        <li class="style2"> To raise the consciousness of society in general, and government in particular, on the importance of standards to society. With the increasing interdependence of the world on the Internet and the Web, the standards that enable communications and information technology are becoming essential to the operation of almost all aspects of modern life. The Standards MetaLibrary will provide a ready, effective and encyclopedic reference for those creating policy and supporting the legislative process. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="style2"> To encourage the proliferation of serious works of scholarship on standards and standard setting. By providing greater exposure for existing work, greater ease for conducting further research, and a broader audience for new work, we hope to provide incentives for more authors to dedicate their efforts to works of scholarship in this area of study. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="style2"> By making a rich and growing body of work readily available (most of which has been made available by the copyright holders without cost), we hope to encourage colleges and universities to offer more courses on standards, and to include more readings on standards in the syllabi of courses on other subjects as well. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="style2"> As the number of pages available on the Web expands more rapidly than the ability of search engines to efficiently filter them, the need for specialized on-line research resources becomes more acute. For example, a search using the relatively narrow request &ldquo;consortium +standard +technical +internet +society&rdquo; on the new Google Scholar web browser returned 8,110 items on February 12, 2005. With such riches at hand, how can someone performing research reliably find her way to the particular information needed? </li>

                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style71"><em>How did the Standards MetaLibrary come to be created?</em></strong> The concept and structure of the MetaLibrary was conceived by Andrew Updegrove, the creator of ConsortiumInfo.org, and a partner in the Boston-based law firm of <strong><em>Gesmer Updegrove LLP</em></strong>. That law firm (which has represented more standard setting organizations than any other law firm in the country), supports both ConsortiumInfo.org and the MetaLibrary by providing hosting and web development services. The acquisition of all of the data in the Standards MetaLibrary was made possible by a generous grant from <strong><em>Sun Microsystems, Inc.</em></strong> The web development work was performed by Nathan Burke, the Gesmer Updegrove Webmaster, and all data collection and categorization was conducted by Greg Johnson, who works full-time on ConsortiumInfo.org projects. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style2">In one type of standard (so-called performance standards), only the ends, but not the means are mandated. For purposes of truth in packaging, a 60-watt bulb is a 60-watt bulb, so long as it produces 60 watts of illumination, and regardless of how it achieves that feat. The second type of standard enables interoperability, and this type of standard is far less forgiving. It is this type of standard that assures you that the same 60-watt light bulb just discussed will invariably fit in your light socket. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Clearly, the first type of standard permits great flexibility, while the latter provides virtually none at all. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Is one type of standard better than another? Clearly not; they simply serve different goals. The art, as in so many things, is to find the right balance (even in the second type of standard) between ensuring usability, while enabling beneficial creativity. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> This need for balance is recognized in one of the core tenets of modern standard setting, applauded by competitors, antitrust authorities and economists alike. That tenet goes something like this: vendors should be encouraged to collaborate on the creation of the standards necessary to enable new goods and services to be offered, and then compete in the creation of additional value-added features that will distinguish their particular wares in the marketplace from each other. And, in fact, this is exactly what does happen all of the time. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> This conjunction of collaboration and competition has been in existence for far longer than the modern process of voluntary consensus-based standard setting. Consider, for example, the ancient tradition across all peoples of creating musical instruments (and surprisingly similar instruments, at that). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Anthropologists investigating cultures in out of the way places invariably find each of the three principal musical types in use. Those timeless variations comprise instruments that create sound by (a) hitting something with the hand or some other object, (b) blowing through something hollow, or (c) making a stretched string vibrate. Thus, the first level of musical standardization arises from the realities of physics and the universal availability of certain types of natural materials. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> From this common beginning, local forces may have exerted the most influence on how these universal progenitors further evolved. Those forces could involve variations in locally available materials, or perhaps purely eclectic tastes (compare, for example, the modest pan pipes of the Andes with the ten foot long Alpenhorns of the Tyrol). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Still, within specific cultures standardization of musical instruments invariably did take place - for the same general reasons that standardization usually takes place. Once instruments become similar, several can be played together to yield a more pleasing result, and music can be created that best suits the capabilities of the same instruments. Eventually, music (such as classical music) can be shared on a global basis, inspiring the creation of an ever-growing body of compositions that can be performed as intended anywhere in the world. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> At the same time, individual craftsmen can still compete in the creation of instruments, based upon their talents and the non-standardized elements (or permissible variations within standardized elements) that they may employ to greatest effect. Thus, the particular pieces of wood selected and the secret glues and varnishes devised by master luthiers Amati and Stradivarius helped produce instruments that, while visually indistinguishable from those constructed by lesser mortals, yield sounds of a richness and purity never replicated by their descendants in the same craft. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Happily, the specifications for musical instruments intended for non-symphonic use are more forgiving than those employed in telecommunications. This is in part because some musical instruments embody multiple layers of compliance, not all of which are mandatory. Thus, the builder (and the buyer) can choose the level of compliance that is desired. The result is that there is more room for experimentation, and therefore also for evolution in the state of the art. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> All of which suffices to bring us to one of the truly iconic instruments of the second half of the twentieth century: the Hammond B-3 Organ (with Leslie speakers). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> While you may not recognize the name &quot;Hammond B-3&quot;, if you are an American (or, indeed, a jazz aficionado of any nationality) between the age of 30 and 75, you are nonetheless intimately familiar with its unique voice. To give but a single example, if you recall the soaring organ riff at the end of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash's &quot;Love the One You're With&quot;, you will instantly recognize the instrument of which we speak, and the sound we are eulogizing. Again, if you are a fan of Gospel music, you've heard far more from the B-3 than you ever did from your eighth grade math teacher. Odds are that you paid more attention as well. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> If you have ever seen a B-3 up close at a jazz or rock event, you will not likely have forgotten its unlikely physical presence, either. I made my first acquaintance with one around 1972, at a college mixer. In the middle of the colored lights, black speakers on stands, mikes and amps there incongruously stood what looked like (and was) a full-sized organ, complete with walnut case, double keyboard, full range of foot pedals and stops, and heavy (attached) wooden bench. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> At 400 pounds, the B-3 is a roadie's nightmare and a keyboardists' delight. But a B-3 without a set (two, not one) of six foot high Leslie speakers, each almost as heavy as the organ itself and similarly encased in wood, is not in fact a Hammond B-3 at all. Throughout his life, this reality rankled Laurens Hammond, the inventor of the B-3. While a genius when it came to magnetic field tone generators, Hammond was not as gifted a designer of speakers as was Don Leslie, the acoustic magician behind the eponymous speakers that so brilliantly translated the best the B-3 had to offer into actual sound. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Those Leslie speakers added a further unworldly aspect to the presence of the Hammond B-3 in concert, with their spinning horns that could, at the whim of the musician, be accelerated from a slow spin to a near-blur that produced a paroxysm of Doppler-effected warbling that was like no other. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Was the Hammond B-3 an organ? Indisputably, just as Marilyn Monroe was&hellip; You get the idea. The basic elements were standard, but the way they were put together was unique. If Stradivarius was just another craftsman, then Laurens Hammond was just a technician. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Amazingly enough, Laurens was closer to that description than one would expect. By most accounts, he may even have been tone deaf. But he was an incredibly gifted engineer that brought (then) cutting edge technology to the design of a venerable mechanical instrument, creating a bridge between the church pipe organ (with which it was intended to compete) and the modern music synthesizer. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> In the roughly 20 years that the B-3 was in production, over 100,000 were sold -- making it the most popular electric organ ever built. An enormous number are still in use, partly through the efforts of the skilled refurbishers that have sprung up to keep them in action. So popular did the Hammond B-3 organ become, and so perfectly matched to it were the Leslie speakers, that Don Leslie never bothered to advertise his wares at all. In fact, he was barely able to meet the demand. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Today, manufacturers continue to offer instruments that consciously (if never totally successfully) mimic the combination of a Hammond B-3 and a set of 122 Leslie speakers. But listen to the DJ give the credits on a jazz show, and you'll always hear them carefully intone who is &quot;on the Hammond B-3 organ&quot; on a given track. Look closely on the liner notes of a CD, and you'll see the same thing. That's not Eric Clapton's session musician on the &quot;electric organ&quot;. He's on a <em>Hammond B-3</em> organ. In other words, the Hammond B-3 has received recognition as an instrument in its own right - something even Stradivarius failed to achieve. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Does all of this make the B-3 a &quot;gold standard?&quot; Not at all. A B-3 sounds like a B-3, and nothing else truly does (or perhaps ever will). Instead, the Hammond B-3 set a unique standard that continues to be valued for the qualities that set it apart. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> Or, in modern standards parlance, Laurens Hammond out-competed all others with his ability to create truly superlative value-added features. A conclusion in which all music lovers would concur. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> All, perhaps, except those who also happen to have been roadies. </p>

They can listen to a textbook on a computer or read using refreshable braille. Yet students with print disabilities needed to wait six months or longer for an accessible textbook to be made available. This will change with the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (IDEA). The act, signed December 3 by President Bush, gives students with print disabilities equal access to educational materials as their sighted peers. Key to the act is requiring a standard file format for each textbook. This makes conversion into accessible formats such as braille, large print or digital text much faster. ...<a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20050208005505&newsLang=en">Full Story
