  Effectively adapting to change and leveraging new opportunities is essential to economic success. Companies skillful in this process secure advantages over their less adept competitors. Incorporating standards planning into corporate strategy provides just such an opportunity. Observations and analysis of standards activity over the past few years reveals that trends are emerging among current standards participants - and allows us to suggest specific best practices and predictions that IT companies can use to compete more successfully........ <a href="#trends">Read More</a>  <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="2"><a href="/bulletins/pdf/jun03/trends.pdf">Print This Article (PDF)</a></font></font></b> </font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How important are standards? Anyone from a plumbing inspector to an IT director would readily answer &quot;Very.&quot; Go down one level deeper into the subject of standard setting, and several more intriguing questions will suggest themselves: How important is participating in standard setting? And to whom? And why?</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judging by the hundreds of technology standard setting organizations in existence and the thousands of companies that choose to join them, the answer to the first of these questions (How important?) would seem to be obvious: &quot;Very,&quot; once again. Divining an accurate response to the next question (To whom?) requires a bit more effort, although with enough time and patience, one could compile a database by simply visiting enough consortium and SDO websites and logging in the membership lists posted there. Answering the last question (Why?), however, requires going directly to the source. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just why exactly do companies (as well as government agencies, academic institutions and others) participate in IT standards groups? And what is the answer to one last question - how do they decide in which specific organizations to participate?</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The largest IT companies participate in scores - and sometimes hundreds - of standard setting bodies. The investment of such companies in dues, travel budgets, dedicated personnel and internal management costs can run well into 8 figures. Smaller companies may be involved in fewer organizations, but their investment - both in cash as well as in human resource terms, and the strategic consequences of the standards-based decisions that they make - can be just as significant.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even the largest IT company is not likely to join every available organization. And even if its resources permitted it to do so, there are strategic decisions to be made where more than one alternative is available - at this time two years ago, should an IBM or an HP have decided to support Bluetooth, or HomeRF or Wi-Fi (or, hedging its bets, all three)? Inevitably, solving this dilemma would have involved guessing the answers to additional questions, such as: Which approach or group is most likely to succeed? Which technology would provide the best &quot;fit&quot; for the potential member's existing products and services? Which other companies (both friend and foe) have endorsed which endeavor? And so on.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this issue of the CSB we look at how companies should evaluate which organizations to join, and also report on how some of the largest IT companies actually go about the process. The survey completed by the organizations confirms what we have observed over time - that there is less centralized direction in evaluating standard setting participation than one might expect. Inevitably, this leads to more questions: Is a lack of a centralized business evaluation process a good thing, permitting quick intuitive reactions to a rapidly developing marketplace? Or is it simply the case that even companies that have made a strong commitment to standard setting have not yet gotten around to bringing order to the process of evaluating them? And, in actual practice, does it turn out to make any difference?</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, there are few answers to these questions. While there is anecdotal information available, to this author's knowledge there is little or no empirical data on questions such as why specific types of companies join specific organizations; whether companies are consistent in their evaluative techniques; and whether using one set of selective criteria over another is likely to yield a better long-term result. If more such information were available, two positive results could be achieved: companies could more efficiently and effectively engage in standard setting activities, and the organizations in which they participate could better tailor their offerings to the members that they serve.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, there is also no central location for such information, nor any general venue within which best practices can be discussed in a manner not specific to a single technology.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A founding goal of the <em><strong>Consortium Standards Bulletin</strong></em> and its companion resource site, <a href="/">ConsortiumInfo.org</a>, is to obtain and aggregate information about how standard setting is done, in order to help develop and share the type of &quot;best practices&quot; that will make the global standard setting infrastructure itself more efficient and productive. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One way of collecting the information that can lead to such best practices is through surveys. In this, our first year of publication, we have presented a number of surveys: examining which organizations should set web services standards (<a href="/bulletins/may03.php#featured"> The Role of Web Services Standards Bodies: In Their Own Words</a> ), reviewing what types of news consortia release - and how much of it is really &quot;news&quot; (<a href="/bulletins/mar03.php#featured">How Consortia Tell the News: A Survey of Over 150 Consortia and SDOs</a>), and in this issue, how major companies evaluate which organizations to join (<a href="#featured">SURVEY: MAJOR STANDARDS PLAYERS TELL HOW THEY EVALUATE STANDARD SETTING ORGANIZATIONS</a>).</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We hope that you find these surveys interesting and useful. If so, you may find that you wish that more respondents had contributed data to the effort. If you are involved in standard setting at your company or in a consortium and would be willing to participate in future surveys, we would welcome your assistance. The greater the participation, the greater the value of the results that we can report back to you.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you were to create a database of the members of standard setting organizations (SSOs), you would find that some large IT companies are members of an astonishing number of such collaborative efforts - 150 or more. You might then want to ask questions like: How do IT companies like these decide in which organizations to become involved, and how do they monitor whether to stay involved? What can other companies learn from their more heavily invested peers, and what can the standard setting organizations themselves learn from these existing and potential members? </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to find out the answers to these questions, we turned to the Directors of Standards of three of the most active participants in all types of SSOs. The companies surveyed include two of the most influential IT vendors in the world (<em><strong>Hewlett-Packard</strong></em> and <em><strong>Sun Microsystems</strong></em>) and, for balance, a non-technology vendor with over $40 billion in 2002 revenues whose businesses are heavily dependent on technology, but is not itself principally a technology vendor. [The non-technology vendor company requested that its name not be disclosed, and is referred to below as &quot;Company #3&quot;]. </font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Instructions</em></strong>: The survey questions were intended to address several areas of inquir and were grouped accordingly. Each respondent was permitted to decline answering questions where confidentiality or other concerns arose, but all three respondents answered almost every applicable question. Precision in numerical data was not required where exact data was unavailable or unduly burdensome to access.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Survey Participants</em></strong>: Each company respondent has recognized the importance of standards and of coordinating its standard setting activities by appointing a Director of Standards, and each gave its Director of Standards permission to respond to the survey. The individual respondents are some of the most experienced standards experts in the IT industry; each has decades of experience in the world of technology and standard setting and speaks from a depth of experience gained through participation in many of the industry's most important SSOs. They are:</font></p>

                    </div>
                    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>A. <u>What is your level and manner of participation?</u></em></strong> While all three organizations are heavily invested in standard setting, both of the technology vendors participate far more heavily (by a factor of five) over the non-technology vendor (HP and Sun each being involved in 150 SSOs or more, while Company #3 is involved in only 25 to 30). This should not be surprising, since technology vendors need standards to create product opportunities, while non-technology vendors most often join SSOs in order to influence standards development for their particular businesses and learn how to deploy standards effectively. Such end-users of standards are also less likely to be interested in promoting the adoption of standards. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both Sun and HP are frequently recruited by SSOs soliciting their financial and technical support, receiving as many as one serious solicitation per week (HP: approx. 40 per year; Sun: 1 per week average). These solicitations appear to be productive for both sides, since the likelihood of success in the recruiting effort is relatively high (HP gives serious consideration to about 20 SSOs a year, while Sun takes an active interest in about 12). In fact, HP is recruited by almost every organization that it joins (unless it is a founder). Sun, on the other hand, identifies about 50% of the organizations that it chooses to join before it is solicited, indicating a more proactive approach. Despite the size and prominence of Company #3, it joins SSOs as a result of solicitation only 15% of the time, indicating that SSOs may be neglecting recruitment opportunities in the end-user community (See responses to question C.3).</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The likelihood of success in recruiting a given company, however, relies in part on its philosophical beliefs about how standard setting should be conducted. Both HP and Sun are responsive to newly formed SSOs, while Company #3 prefers to work with existing SSOs, in order to limit the proliferation of new, untested (and possibly redundant) organizations. This difference in opinion also surfaced when the questions turned to founding new SSOs. Both HP and Sun actively participate in founding new SSOs (HP: about 15 a year; Sun: about 3, with this number likely to rise in the future), and each is considering starting several new SSOs at this time. Company #3, on the other hand, is not likely to help found a new organization.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What leads a company to tackle the cost, effort and uncertainty of founding a new SSO, rather than look to an existing organization? Bell cites the need for &quot;Focus, speed, and seeking members with shared objectives.&quot; Cargill offers three reasons: first is a bias against accredited SSOs (an opinion not expressed by the other two respondents), which he feels often compromise the integrity of results in order to achieve consensus. The second is the lack of an existing organization able, or willing, to undertake the project. He states the third reason candidly:</font></p>
                  <blockquote><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can start an SSO to counter another SSO - not a nice thing, but sometimes politically expedient. This leads to standards wars, which can be ugly, however, and therefore this is a last resort. </font></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Cargill notes a fourth alternative, which has become increasingly popular: starting an open source project, with no formal consortium structure at all.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>B. <u>What types of organizations do you join?</u></em></strong> All three organizations join all types of SSOs. Each participates in both consortia as well as accredited organizations, and each is involved in national, regional, and global organizations. Sun, for example, participates in both European and Asian regional organizations, as well as in accredited national bodies in Britain, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Ireland. Europe's strong efforts to create standards on a regional basis was clearly reflected in a question asking the respondent to give &quot;notable examples&quot; of regional bodies in which the respondent companies participate: Six European bodies were named, and three US organizations.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>C. <u>How do you make your decisions procedurally?</u></em></strong> While each company has centralized the process of participation approval to a degree, there are many variations in how the process is carried out. In the case of HP, business approval is needed before an application is considered by the standards office. At Sun central clearance is required, but Cargill indicates that it is difficult to enforce this rule. He estimates that 30% of the applications for new memberships escape central review. Like HP, the business decision to participate is made first (at the business unit level) before the approval of the central standards office is sought. At Company #3, new guidelines for evaluating SSO membership applications are now being reviewed. The guidelines &quot;emphasize the need for a clear business case, management approval, legal review, and Standards Office coordination.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">None of the three organizations have an overall policy guiding the types of organizations to join (e.g., by business area, type of organization, etc.), nor any formal checklist against which each organization is judged. At Sun, for example, the consideration of a new application by the standards office occurs on a case-by-case basis, with any identified concerns being resolved through discussion.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All three organizations indicate the need for an application for membership to be supported by a &quot;champion&quot; in order for it to be approved. At Sun, that champion usually needs to be a Vice President or a Senior Technical Fellow, representing an informal, but nonetheless effective, internal filtering process as a precondition for central approval.<br>
                        <br>
  Consensus was clearest on the question of intellectual property rights (IPR) policies, with each company giving IPR policies a careful review. The responses to the IPR question are worth noting verbatim:</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the respondents uniformly require the central review and approval of new memberships, they are more relaxed on the subject of membership renewals. HP reviews renewals only if there have been major changes (e.g., to the organization's IPR policy), while Sun has no formal review policy for renewals. Company #3 notes that it is currently putting &quot;an informal process in place&quot; for vetting renewals on an annual basis.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>D. <u>How do you make your decisions qualitatively?</u></em></strong> Sun and HP responded to a question asking them to rank several specific reasons for joining (or, if necessary, founding) an SSO, but some of their evaluations varied significantly: while each ranked the absence of a standard or the need to promote a new business method or market as a strong motivator, HP ranked &quot;ability to influence final standard&quot; highly, and Sun did not. Similarly, while HP found concerns over the &quot;wrong&quot; standard, or the wrong companies setting a standard, as a motivating concern, Sun ranked both of these factors as being less important. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the open-ended questions, each organization reported a surprisingly varied set of criteria which may lead it to join - or pass on - a given organization.

I'm not sure how many I would describe as 'failures'&#8230;they just didn't do what I thought they should do.&quot;</font></p>

When asked what SSO's don't do, but should, Bell would have existing organizations provide a structure and process that would allow more to be done through existing SSOs, while Cargill wished that SSOs would take up the task of educating people about the need for standards.</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the cardinal frustrations of evolutionary scientists is the inability to speed up the evolutionary clock in order to observe species changes in process. In fact, the Holy Grail of anyone in this field is to stumble upon and document a new species in the process of branching off of an existing one. Such a quest is more realistic for those who actively observe the standards world, since the pace of change is infinitely more rapid. If fact, an example of &quot;standards process speciation&quot; has recently occurred with the advent of the open source community solution for some types of interoperability issues. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the more pervasive manifestation of evolution is gradual adaptive change - the less dramatic series of adjustments resulting from the fact that those individuals that are best equipped to play at the game of life are most successful in passing their genes along to their progeny.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commercial entities are captive to the same dynamics, but with a difference: if they can figure out the course of the future better than their competitors, they will be more likely to thrive and pass increased value along to their shareholders. One of the few ways to glimpse - and even influence - some aspects of the future is through the exercise of an active, informed and coherent standards strategy. Given that reality, it is surprising that there has been comparatively little study of standard setting. Hence, there is little broad understanding of its dynamics, and a failure by many companies to fully exploit the competitive advantages that a carefully crafted standards strategy can secure. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the <a href="#survey">preceding article</a>, we report on the results of a detailed survey completed by three companies that are heavily invested in the standard setting process. While the number of respondents to the survey is not statistically meaningful, the companies involved are major participants in the standard setting process and their influence is significant (both by their participation in many organizations at the Board level, as well as by example). As a result, a number of interesting and useful observations can be drawn from their responses to the survey. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And more intriguingly, a number of recommendations and predictions can be extrapolated from the same data, when conjoined with first-hand experience. These recommendations can assist IT companies be more successful in the Darwinian struggle for success.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>II. Observations and Predictions</em></strong></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If one rises above the operations of any individual SSO or participant and looks at the reality of standard setting today, some clear trends and their probable future courses begin to emerge. Here are some of the more significant:</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>The level of central control over standard setting participation is not great at many companies, but will increase</em></strong>. Despite the level of importance of standard setting to technology companies, and the risk that valuable IPR may be compromised by participation, oversight of participation has not historically been strict at many companies. However, oversight today is much more centralized than just a few years ago, as a result of a number of well-publicized IPR cases involving participation and conduct in standard setting. Once a centralized review process has been put in place for IPR purposes, its capabilities can be extended in other ways to bring greater coherence and efficiency to a company-wide standards strategy. Companies would be wise to make use of such enhanced capabilities.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>The focus on IPR policies will become even greater. </em></strong>While the trend toward tighter supervision over IPR policies will certainly continue, achieving meaningful internal control over participation by company representatives in SSOs indicates a significant challenge, especially for large corporations with operations in many countries. Due to the practical impossibility of day-to-day legal supervision of hundreds (and even thousands) of engineering staff that act as representatives in myriad SSOs, the only pragmatic way to avoid jeopardizing valuable IPR is to focus on an SSO's IPR policy - as well as its process mechanics - in order to lower the risk inherent in substantially unmonitored participation. Policies which are poorly articulated and which do not require clearly documented assertions regarding IPR, for example, present a higher potential for errors and disputes.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Vendors disproportionately participate in - and therefore disproportionately control - many SSOs (and especially consortia). This may have a negative impact (for all concerned). </em></strong>Not only do vendors tend to join more SSOs, but they often join at higher membership levels and consequently pay the lion's share of the budgets of such SSOs through their dues. In many organizations, they also take the lion's share of the board seats. Even if there is no actual intention to weight results in favor of vendors, there can be a negative impact due to lack of diversity of interest and experience in the high-level decision making that charts the SSO's course. Vendors would therefore be well advised to welcome diversity of members and opinions rather than exploit their numeric and economic influence. Otherwise, the standards offered to the market by the SSO may be unattractive to other vital constituencies, and fail to become widely adopted.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Only a subset of companies actively starts new SSOs. As a result, these companies are likely to be more influential in standard setting and enjoy a competitive advantage</em></strong>. It is a simple truth that the founders of a new SSO will usually have a disproportionate impact on the initial work product than those that come afterwards. Hence, even if influencing the final work product is not a goal, that impact will likely nonetheless exist. This will not always be good. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Accredited SSOs and consortia can both be &quot;gamed.&quot;</em></strong> It is necessary to thoroughly understand how an organization works prior to joining in order to judge how &quot;open&quot; it truly is. And after joining, it is even more necessary to understand how an SSO works in order to be aware of - and protest - actual abuse. Those companies that train their participating personnel most thoroughly will be able to defend their interests more effectively.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Even companies that make huge financial and human resource commitments to standard setting participation often do not follow a rigid process for vetting participation.</em></strong> This manifests itself not only at the application stage, but throughout the period of membership. Not infrequently, through personnel changes, a company &quot;forgets&quot; that it is a member of an organization, ceases participating, and yet may even pay up when it receives a membership renewal notice. The result is not only financial inefficiency, but also loss of opportunity.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Despite the proliferation of SSOs, IT companies still find that they need to start new ones.</em></strong> This is in some ways a commendable as well as a regrettable condition. One of the reasons that consortia became popular some 20 years ago was because a market that evolves as rapidly as the IT space requires rapid responses. By evolving an alternative process in addition to the already established accredited organizations, industry was able to react more flexibly and quickly, when nimbleness and speed were needed. However, forming a new organization has its own risks: starting up takes time and money, and the results are dependent on multiple variables, including the success of recruitment, the ability to set an effective process in place, and avoiding proprietary influences. There is much to be said for the existence of organizations such as W3C, OASIS and OpenGIS, which host (and welcome) many processes under one roof that are consistent with an over-arching and coherent strategic mission.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>IT standards are becoming more effective and important. </em></strong>With the advent of the Internet and technologies such as wireless, an increasing number of products are becoming dependent upon available, timely and effective standards. Those companies that have an Office of Standards are more likely to be able to realize such realities, articulate them to decision makers, recommend effective actions, and supervise execution, thus conveying a competitive advantage over companies that are less standards-aware.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>The importance of standard setting is not sufficiently recognized at the institutional level. </em></strong>The fact that most companies do not include standard setting as a budget line item may indicate that its value is insufficiently understood at the management level. This may be due to cultural factors, such as the separation between engineering and sales (and the fact that many peoples' eyes glaze over at the mere mention of the word &quot;standards&quot;). Institutional recognition of the importance of an effective standards strategy, however, is an essential first step towards mounting a coherent competitive plan.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>III. Recommendations to Companies </em> </strong></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The observations above suggest that those who most actively participate in standard setting do so to gain strategic advantages. If it is true that pursuing an effective standards strategy can secure strategic advantage (and the major commitments by leading IT vendors to standard setting indicates that they believe this to be so), then those of their competitors who are less active or skillful in this area may be expected to suffer. This should be reason enough for those companies that have not incorporated standards participation into their strategic plan to consider such a course of action. The following are some specific recommendations to consider when performing such an evaluation.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Recognize at the corporate level that effective standards participation is mission critical, and incorporate standards into overall strategy. </em></strong>In order to compete effectively, standards need to be integrated into central strategy, rather than be relegated to the status of an engineering-level pastime. Once standards planning is included in strategy, it is highly advisable to create a centralized standards office to effectively coordinate and manage disparate standards efforts in order to reap maximum advantage.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>If standards in a given area are mission critical, then allocate resources accordingly.</em></strong> While a small company cannot afford a Standards Office, a large one can. (A small company can still retain knowledgeable advisors to assist its standards efforts, however.) Participation in standard setting fulfills many functions: influencing outcomes, gaining advance knowledge of important standards, gaining access to training for key personnel, and so on. The proliferation of regional, as well as national, SSOs has made the game more complex, and experienced, dedicated staff is needed to understand how the many pieces fit together. Such individuals are in very short supply, but there is no substitute for hands-on experience.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>The level of experience of standards participants is often not high.</em></strong> Hiring, training and deploying skilled personnel to participate in SSOs therefore represents a competitive advantage. This opportunity exists at the macro level (in setting overall corporate standards strategy), as well as the micro level (in technical committees and on SSO boards) by influencing outcomes. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Those companies that do not favor forming new SSOs should consider becoming early members of new SSOs that they believe are likely to succeed.</em></strong> This recommendation stems from the observations that those who do form SSOs have the advantage of setting its technical agenda and are likely to disproportionately control the SSO for some period of time. Once such a group of companies has forced the issue by starting a new SSO, it may be strategically prudent for the founding companies' competitors to join as quickly as possible in order to ensure the neutrality of the organization and its eventual output. Companies that do not normally favor starting new SSOs would therefore be wise to actively monitor the activities of companies that are known for forming new SSOs, and act promptly in technical areas where their strategic interests are at stake. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Companies should make it known that they are willing to be founding members of new SSOs.</em></strong> This is the logical extension of the same precept. Most new SSOs go through a pre-public planning phase. During that phase, they will commonly agree upon the governance structure, and perhaps the IPR policy as well, of the new organization. There is therefore a strategic advantage in being invited to become a founder in order to influence these outcomes, even if forming the new SSO would not otherwise be deemed desirable. It is better to be invited to the table at the earliest stage and be able to make an early assessment of the likely success or failure of the organization, than to be forced into a reactive, less influential posture after the new organization is announced.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Approval of joining and renewing memberships should be subject to more strict central approval.</em></strong> At present, many companies err on the side of decentralized business (and even legal) approval for SSO participation. While this is sensible in that management of the business unit involved may be best able to understand the advantages of membership, it makes it more difficult to weigh alternatives when opportunities exceed budgets, and may result in an incoherent (and even internally competitive) overall standards program. While the common practice of combining central approval based upon the recommendation of a senior &quot;champion&quot; provides a partial solution to this problem, a more complete solution would include centrally created and distributed parameters and criteria for participation, conjoined with a standard evaluation schema against which opportunities can be measured. While too mechanical an application of such a schema would be unwise, using a checklist as a tool to effectively present and evaluate opportunities should improve overall results. A shorter form with a similar purpose should accompany renewal applications. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>With the increasing importance of standards, the costs of non-participation are becoming higher.</em></strong> In order to be competitive, end-users as well as vendors need to be increasingly knowledgeable about new standards that affect their enabling technology, even if they are less interested in influencing outcomes. Participation in many SSOs can be useful in advance planning and effective training.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Markets can be not only created but accelerated through collaboration.</em></strong> Increasingly, new product and service opportunities are dependent on not only the development of standards, but on the rapid adoption of those standards. SSOs can be effective on both fronts. The cost to a founder of forming a new SSO - even as a significant sponsor - is often trivial in comparison to the opportunity.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>IV. Recommendations to SSOs</em></strong></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Recruitment pays. </em></strong>Many under-resourced consortia invest comparatively little effort in seeking members. However, the indications of this survey are that even the largest corporations can be recruited by effective efforts. Accordingly, allocating funds to recruitment (including using dedicated staff or third party service providers) may be highly cost effective.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>IPR policies are crucial.</em></strong> An SSO today cannot afford to have an out-of-date IPR policy. Not only may a defective policy result in commercial disputes, but it will make recruiting and retention of the most active members difficult, or even impossible.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Neither SDOs nor Consortia are &quot;better.&quot;</em></strong> Members care about results, and not labels. SSOs of all types need to understand - and serve - their customers. Like any other commercial enterprise, they cannot do so unless they thoroughly understand the customer and its needs.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Remember that management members are employees and not owners.</em></strong> SSOs should be about service, and not self-perpetuation. While there is nothing wrong with creativity, entrenchment is invariably a negative. An SSO needs to be able to dispassionately tell the difference between prudently adapting to meet evolving market and technical realities and a reluctance to merge or disband when its day in the sun has passed.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>V. Conclusions</em></strong></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Socrates is said to have once famously observed that: &quot;The unexamined life is not worth living.&quot; Given the importance of standard setting to the modern commercial world, it is curious that there is as little examination of the process of standard setting as there appears to be. When one observes the degree of activity and commitment of the largest technology vendors to the standards process, it becomes evident that an IT player that does not examine (or worse, even have) a standards strategy may eventually find that it no longer has a commercial life to live.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While such a statement may seem to smack of hyperbole, consider this: the faster the pace of technological change, the narrower the margin for error, the greater the reward to those who guess right, and the more severe the economic punishment of those who guess wrong. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Corporate managers would do well to recall their Darwin. Standards strategy is too important to survival to be left to the engineers alone.</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust hearing against Rambus Inc. is still continuing, Rambus has already gained one advantage. Recently, Administrative Law Judge Stephen McGuire ruled that the attorney-client privilege bars some information from being introduced, which the FTC had sought to present, including communications among Rambus management and its outside legal counsel.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ruling is significant in two respects: First, it is the reverse of a decision made in Rambus' patent infringement trial against Infineon Technologies AG. In that action, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Payne refused to uphold the attorney-client privilege with respect to certain documents, thus allowing Infineon to obtain documents involving Rambus' patent filings. And second, it was communications between Rambus and its counsel that appeared to particularly influence the jury in that action.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, Rambus shareholders have abandoned a class-action suit in which they had claimed that the actions of Rambus had depleted the value of their stock. The case was dropped after a U.S. Appeals Court overturned fraud charges against Rambus in the earlier Infineon trail referred to above. The shareholders agreed to permit the case to be dismissed &quot;with prejudice,&quot; which will prevent the original plaintiffs from refiling the suit or an appeal, although other stockholders could still file a separate suit.</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our last issue, we reported on the <a href="/bulletins/may03.php#w3c">announcement by the W3C</a> that it had successfully developed and secured adoption by its broad membership of a policy that would virtually guarantee its adoption of only standards which could be implemented on a royalty free basis. We also suggested that W3C's announcement would have an impact on the decisions of other consortia. In the following press release the OpenGIS Consortium not only reaffirms its own royalty-free principles, but states &quot;We are pleased to be able to reinforce the profoundly important statement made by the W3C in defense of the unencumbered use of open, publicly available standards specifications.&quot;</font></p>
