			<p>Not long ago, simply upgrading the aging U.S. electric grid to the state of the digital art to reduce power failures seemed like a big challenge.

			<h4>EDITOR'S NOTE:</h4>
			<h3>With Renewed Energy</h3>
			<p>The first paragraph in my Editor's Note to the last issue read as follows:</p>
			<blockquote><em>This issue marks the third and final (for now) entry in a cycle that addresses the role of technical standards in government, and vice versa, occasioned by the election of America's new, technologically savvy president, Barack Obama.</em></blockquote>
			<p>But even as I wrote that paragraph, a nagging voice in the back of my mind was reminding me that I really wasn't done yet. No serious effort to provide an overview of the Obama Administration's standards-related challenges could be considered complete until I had addressed one more important topic.</p>
			<p>That topic, of course, is the new administration's highly ambitious, extremely expensive, and vitally important plan to upgrade the nation's electrical system from its electro-mechanical past into the digital, intelligent future that beckons &mdash; and to extend that network intelligence into the homes and businesses of America as well. If successful in achieving this goal, President Obama will go a long way towards delivering on a trifecta of important and challenging administration promises: lowering our dependence on foreign oil and gas, creating new, sustaining and high paying manufacturing jobs in "green" industries, and significantly decreasing America's production of green house gasses. But none of this will be possible to accomplish unless government and industry work together to compile the hundreds of standards that will be necessary to make the Smart Grid work, selecting them where they exist, developing them where they do not, and then implementing them ubiquitously.</p>
			<p>So with renewed energy to pursue the important topic of government's new willingness to drive ambitious standards-dependent challenges, I make amends with this issue, and provide an introduction to Smart Grid standards in a manner similar to the previous overviews of Electronic Health Record (<a href="/bulletins/dec08.php">December &ndash; January</a>) and Open Government Standards (<a href="/bulletins/feb09.php">February &ndash; March</a>).</p>
			<p>My <strong><em><a href="#editorial">Editorial</a></em></strong> introduces the topic by highlighting one of the significant challenges realizing the benefits that the Smart Grid can deliver, one that we all share a responsibility to address. If home owners to not embrace Smart Grid technology, then the billions of dollars of public investment that rely on the installation and use of home-based Smart Grid technology to achieve their intended results may be wasted.</p>
			<p>As before, the <strong><em><a href="#feature">Feature Article</a></em></strong> attempts to provide an understandable overview of what the goals of the government's initiative are all about, and the role that standards must play in achieving these goals. More particularly, I provide an overview of the history of government support for the creation of the Smart Grid and the legislation that has been passed to drive its development. I then review the types of standards that will be needed (and whether they currently exist), and the principal standard setting organizations that are actively engaged in the development and support of these standards.</p>
			<p>I'm very pleased to follow with an <strong><em><a href="#interview">Interview</a></em></strong> of Dr. George W. Arnold, recently appointed to act as the first National Coordinator for Smart Grid Interoperability at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), who provides his first-hand insights into where we are in meeting the Smart Grid challenge, where we need to go, and how we will get there. I have been pleased to know and work with George for some years at ANSI, where he has been very active in a variety of leadership positions, including serving as Chairman of the Board from 2003 &ndash; 2005.</p>
			<p>The balance of the issue covers other topics that I hope you will find of current interest: my <strong><em><a href="#blog">Standards Blog</a></em></strong> juxtaposes a meeting location that just about every American business travel has found him or herself in at some time with what lies not so far away, while my <strong><em><a href="#considerthis">Consider This</a></em></strong> essay focuses on the current challenges of the print media to survive in an increasingly digital age. This issue closes with a Monday Witness <strong><em><a href="#mondaywitness">Monday Witness</a></em></strong> essay that explores how those that write history can define that term to their own advantage.</p>
			<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this issue. But whether you do or don't, it's always good to hear from you. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:andrew.updegrove@gesmer.com">andrew.updegrove@gesmer.com</a>.</p>

			<h4>EDITORIAL:</h4>
			<h3>Energy Conservation From Zero to Sixty</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<blockquote>Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. electric power delivery infrastructure served our nation well,&hellip; This once state-of-the-art system brought a level of prosperity to the United States unmatched by any other nation in the world. But a 21st-century U.S. economy cannot be built on a 20th-century electric grid.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Vision for the Modern Grid, National Energy Technology<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laboratory, for the DOE, March 2007</em></blockquote>
			<p>For decades utility companies and environmentalists alike have known that the most dramatic and economical advances in energy policy could be achieved through energy conservation than by any other means. By utilizing techniques as simple as buying more efficient appliances and better insulating our homes we can lower our dependence on foreign oil, release fewer greenhouse gases, and savemoney as well, all at the same time. For almost as long, utilities have promoted the concept of "demand side management," and sought to enlist the aid of consumers and businesses to shift electricity usage to low-demand times of the day, with the potential benefit of avoiding the need to build expensive new power plants.</p>
			<div class="calloutright">
				<p>Sadly, conservation efforts that depend on consumer cooperation have been only marginally successful at best, gaining traction primarily during energy price peaks, and as quickly subsiding as gas prices recede.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Sadly, conservation efforts that depend on consumer cooperation have been only marginally successful at best, gaining traction primarily during energy price peaks, and as quickly subsiding as gas prices recede. Where gains have been made, this has occurred slowly and through regulatory means, as old appliances fail and are replaced by those that are built to the higher efficiency ratings that are now required by law, and as older buildings are rebuilt or replaced according to new, more energy-aware building codes. But where regulations have not applied, progress has been less satisfying. Few homeowners have opted to install inexpensive energy conservation tools, such as timer-based thermostats and water heaters, that could save them money every month, while slowing the rise of utility rates as well.</p>
			<p>Today, through the use of new technologies and standards, and as a product of a new administration in Washington, there is the very real potential to advance energy conservation by an order of magnitude in a surprisingly short period of time. The name that has been given to űber design concept that its proponents believe can result in such a quantum leap in policy realization is the "Smart Grid."</p>
			<p>One way to grasp what a transition to a Smart Grid can do for energy is by way of analogy: In many ways, the Smart Grid would be to the existing utility network what the Internet and the Web have become to the traditional telecommunications system. Before the Internet, that system was a privately owned, government regulated technology backbone that delivered and accepted a limited range of transmissions (largely voice and fax data) from homes and businesses that could create and accept those signals, and nothing more. In other words, although the network was smart, the nodes (us) were dumb.</p>
			<p>Today, of course, the telecommuni-cations backbone comprises the connective tissue between that links an exploding cloud of very smart nodes that feed many data formats (voice, graphic, video) into the system in order to serve virtually all of society's needs, from supporting financial transactions to delivering content of all kinds to supporting global supply chains. Even a humble laptop can play a vital role in creating, managing and utilizing many of the most complex functions that the Internet now supports. The result is that the telecommunications system has become a vastly more valuable network than it ever was before &mdash; not one, but several orders of magnitude more valuable and essential to the moment by moment existence and operation of society, commerce, science, education and government.</p>
			<p>To close the analogy, as every home WiFi enabled network can become an intelligent node in the global telecommunications network, so can the electrical system of every home or business become an intelligent, interactive node in the national electric grid network. Much as a home or business router can tie a host of two-way services and capabilities into the telephone and cable system, so can a home or business electrical network become an interactive part of the power grid in ways that can dramatically lower costs to the user and demand on utilities, thereby helping achieve all of the environmental, social, and national benefits noted above.</p>
			<p>How? By enabling end users to cost-effectively install alternative energy sources, such as wind generators and solar panels that can not only provide immediate power, but that will automatically and intelligently become part of the Smart Grid upon installation. An ever expanding number of the these highly distributed generating units will be able to sell excess power back into the grid at the highest price in real time to distant users, including those that may be willing to pay a premium for "green" power.</p>
			<p>A Smart Grid-enabled home system will both decrease central generating requirements as well as lower home owner utility bills by monitoring electrical prices as they fluctuate during the day, and shifting consumption to lower-cost, off-peak times of day while selling back stored energy during high peak, high cost hours, all in real time and on a transactional basis. The owner of a hybrid automobile will also be able to treat that vehicle as a plug and play node in the Smart Grid, able to sell power into the grid at night when the owner is asleep as well as to "fuel up" on electricity at a remote location, all the while resulting in up and down adjustments to the owner's home utility bill.</p>
			<p>The technology to do this all of this is available now, or will be in the near furture. The government is counting on users to not only accept that technology in their homes, but to pay attention to it as well. In the words of the Vision document quoted above:</p>
			<blockquote>In the modernized grid, well-informed consumers will modify consumption based on the balancing of their demands and the electric system's capability to meet those demands. Demand for new cost-saving and energy-saving products will benefit both the consumer and the power system.</blockquote>
			<p>But will consumers in fact play their part?</p>
			<div class="calloutright">
				<p>"In the modernized grid, well-informed consumers will modify consumption based on the balancing of their demands and the electric system's capability to meet those demands" &mdash; NETL</p>
			</div>
			<p>The answer to that question will almost surely be both yes and no. No, if consumers, and to a lesser extent businesses, must hire expensive contractors to undertake otherwise unnecessary upgrades, configure and maintain complex new systems, and opt into confusing billing arrangements. But yes if electrical products of all appropriate types are made to "plug and play" with the Smart Grid out of the box, without complex configuration requirements and able to query customers in plain English in easy to understand displays. And yes again if all utility companies use the same formats and conventions to create, transmit, and report Smart Grid information back to consumers in ways that they can readily understand.</p>
			<p>That is where standards will play a vital behaviorist as well as technical role, because without standards, nothing can plug and play, no information can be shared, and no network effects can be felt. Nor will prices drop to the point where government subsidies will become unnecessary, or competition arise to provide ever greater efficiencies and more valuable efficiencies.</p>
			<p>For this to happen, hundreds of existing and non-existent standards will be needed, and a great deal of determination and cooperation must be demonstrated by thousands of competitors. The good news is that such a challenge has been met before (at least on the technical level), when AT&amp;T brought the nation's telecommunications system forward into the future. And the better news is that the U.S. government, empowered by a national economic crisis, has committed to provide the economic and agency support to make it happen again.</p>
			<p>If we wish to seize this golden opportunity to dramatically accelerate our ability to conserve energy, lower energy costs, and meet our global obligations to curtail greenhouse gases, private industry and utilities need to act swiftly. In order to do so, they must dedicate themselves to collaborating swiftly and effectively to develop and then implement the hundreds of standards that will needed to make the Smart Grid a reality.</p>
			<p>Everyone will be a winner if they do. The most obvious beneficiaries will be the utilities themselves, as they avoid the costs, complexities and uncertainties of permitting and building new power generation facilities. Vendors will also reap huge profits, as they provision the hardware and software that will make the Smart Grid work.</p>
			<p>But the greatest benefits will be felt by the citizens that do their part and climb aboard, doing well through lower energy costs as they do good by helping the nation achieve greater energy independence and a greener future.</p>
			<p>For far too long, energy customers have failed to do their part by taking advantage of the conservation opportunities that governments and utilities have provided in the past. This time around, citizens need to quit idling on the sidelines and make their homes part of the Smart Grid their hard-earned tax dollars will be creating. If they do, America's progress towards a more responsible future will accelerate dramatically.</p>
			<p>Gentlemen &mdash; and Ladies &mdash; clearly it is time to start your engines.</p>

			<h4>INTERVIEW:</h4>
			<h3>How We'll Get the Job Done:<br />an Interview with NIST's Dr. George W. Arnold</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<img class="imgleft" src="apr09/apr09_img1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="269" border="0" />
			<p>Although the inclusion of $4.5 billion dollars of stimulus bill funding for the first time elevated the words "Smart Grid" to the attention of many Americans, in fact the Obama Administration's commitment to upgrading the nation's electrical infrastructure is layered on top of an already-existing government initiative mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). Under that bill, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is assigned the crucial role of ensuring that the standards, protocols, models and other tools necessary to make the Smart Grid a reality will in fact developed and deployed.</p>
			<p>The centerpiece of that effort is something called the "Interoperability Framework," which is now being actively developed by NIST in cooperation with a wide variety of public and private stakeholders. The person leading that important effort is Dr. George W. Arnold, the nation's first National Coordinator for Smart Grid Interoperability, who was appointed to that role on April 13 of this year. In that role, he is responsible for leading the selection and development of the hundreds of standards that will make the Smart Grid not only possible, but able to fulfill the complex and difficult roles that policy makers have assigned to it.</p>
			<p>Happily for that effort, George Arnold's past experience is as closely tailored to the unique demands of his new position as it might be possible to imagine. While a Vice President at Lucent Technologies' Bell Laboratories, he was active in developing the standards needed to transition the nation's telecommunications system into a new technological age, and his organization played a leading role in the development of international standards for Intelligent Networks and IP-based Next Generation Networks. His other standards-related achievements include serving as Chairman of the Board of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), President of the IEEE Standards Association in 2007-2008, and currently as Vice President-Policy for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) where he is responsible for guiding ISO's strategic plan.</p>
			<p>NIST has been driving the development of the Interoperability Framework aggressively since the arrival of the Obama Administration, holding an ongoing succession of work shops with all categories of stakeholders. Recently, these collaborative meetings led to the announcement for comment of the first preliminary list of Smart Grid standards, on May 18.</p>
			<p>In this interview, George Arnold provides his insights into how this rapidly unfolding effort is proceeding, and what we can expect to see and hear in the future.</p>
			<p><strong>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goals and Process</strong></p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> A fully deployed Smart Grid will require a very complex network of standards and standards-related tools in order to fulfill its promise. How would you describe these tools?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> Congress, through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, assigned NIST the task of coordinating the development of a framework that includes protocols and standards for information management to achieve interoperability of smart grid devices and systems. The key words are "achieving interoperability." Standards and protocols are necessary but not sufficient. A reference model that identifies interfaces that must be standardized is part of the framework. Industry has also stressed the need for conformance (testing and certification) to be part of the framework. There will be a lot of focus on common information models and data representations to achieve end-to-end interoperability. For example if you drive your plug-in electric vehicle cross-country and recharge, we need information standards that allow for "roaming" on your utility bill. To create an interoperable network, the smart grid has to be based on open standards. They will be technology neutral to allow for flexibility and innovation. Moving from today's electric grid, in which there has been a tradition of proprietary interfaces and product customization for individual utilities, to an interoperable grid based on open standards is a huge change for the industry. The standards also need to account for the regulatory environment. In addition to the federal government, there are 51 jurisdictions (50 states plus DC).</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> How much of this will be laid out in the Roadmap that is in preparation, and what is the current status of that document?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> We are going about this in three phases. Phase 1 is intended to baseline an initial set of standards that already exist and can be used now for the smart grid, and develop an initial roadmap which identifies new or revised standards that need to be developed, by which organization, and when. The roadmap is focusing on six priority applications: demand response, wide-area situational awareness, electric storage, and electric transportation (these are the four priority areas identified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates the bulk interstate power system) and the advanced metering infrastructure and distribution grid.</p>
			<p>A key issue in the distribution grid is standards for the integration of distributed renewable energy resources. The roadmap will also cover cybersecurity and data networking. NIST is getting input for the roadmap through a series of public workshops. The first two were held in April and May, the work will continue through webinars in June and a third public workshop will be held in July. NIST plans to publish the roadmap in September. In Phase 2, starting in September, we will be setting up a more permanent private sector &mdash; public sector body called the Smart Grid Interoperability Standards Panel which will evolve the roadmap on an ongoing basis and recommend new or revised standards to NIST. Phase 3 will put in place a conformance testing/certification framework to support the smart grid.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> What are the core areas of standardization where progress will be most urgently needed, and how much of the work will involve developing new standards, as compared to assessing and integrating existing standards into the roadmap?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> There are existing standards that provide a starting point. During our first workshop in April we identified 16 existing standards on which there was strong industry consensus and can be used now. That's probably 5% of what will ultimately be needed. We will be adding to the list of NIST-identified standards for the interoperability framework on an ongoing basis. A lot of new standards will need to be developed. We estimate it is in the hundreds. By way of reference, I have looked at what was required to specify the standards for the next generation network in telecom. Over 600 standards documents have been generated thus far after 5 years. Most of them describe a mix and match of existing standards rather than entirely new standards. The smart grid is more complex than NGN. The standards themselves are being developed by about 15 different SDOs.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Do you expect that all of the important standards work will be specified in the Roadmap, or do you anticipate that unexpected standards initiatives will be launched by industry that will add significant value around the edges of the Roadmap as well?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> The Roadmap will always be a living document. It will change over time as industry identifies new applications, architectural improvements, and integrates new technologies.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> What are the areas of standardization where we have the most to work with (e.g., existing standards, existing standards organizations that are appropriate to the task, etc.)?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> There is a rich set of existing standards for the underlying data networking requirements of the smart grid. The main needs here are in selecting appropriate profiles to ensure interoperability across vendors and cybersecurity. There are a lot of existing standards for cybersecurity. The main need is to determine how they should be applied in the smart grid. There are some standards available for data formats, for example for smart meters, and information models for automation within the grid itself. There are existing standards for connection of distributed energy sources to the grid. Some of the most important organizations that are working in this space include IEEE, NEMA, IEC, IETF, NERC, in addition to NIST (for cybersecurity). There are about 15 organizations in total. In addition to traditional SDOs, consortia such as ZigBee are in the mix. ANSI also has a key role in ensuring there is a good process for standards development and facilitating access to IEC and ISO.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> No surprise on the next question: what are the areas where we have the least, and what is the strategy for addressing these areas?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> An example is creating a standard language for representing and communicating dynamic pricing across the grid. This is a very fundamental standard that needs to be developed.  I would add to this standards for demand response signals, and more broadly for distributed renewable energy integration &mdash; common information models for interactions so that we can get to a market driven (price-based) electricity economy that will foster new ways of doing things, new business models, new ways to enable energy efficiency and integration of distributed generation and storage. How to deal with roaming of electric vehicles across the grid is another example.  At our workshops we have been using the use-case methodology to determine what the requirements are.  At the July workshop we expect to identify which standards development organizations should take on these and other tasks.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> If you see any major voids in standards work, how can the Obama Administration go about incentivizing private industry to fill these gaps?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> Secretary of Commerce Locke and Secretary of Energy Chu convened a leadership meeting with 70 industry CEOs and senior executives at the White House on May 18 to gain their commitment to this effort.  It was an unprecedented meeting.  I cannot think of any other program in which standards have received that level of attention. It was also a remarkable meeting.  There was a shared sense of urgency and understanding that the standards needed to be developed on an expedited basis for the smart grid to happen.</p>
			<p>Deployment is actually running ahead of the standards, and the $11 billion of Recovery Act funding for the smart grid will make deployment go even faster.  There is a concern that we cannot allow these investments to become stranded because the standards are not yet there to ensure interoperability.  So the standards work has to move much faster than it usually does.</p>
			<p>I say it was a remarkable meeting because the industry CEOs who were there were much more knowledgeable than I expected about why standards take so long and how they can be done faster.  A lot of good suggestions were made, and the standards organization and industry CEOs who were there made a commitment to apply resources and innovative processes to move the work along quickly.  They viewed the pressure coming from government as helpful.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Do you think that preference should be given to accredited standards organizations over consortia in developing the standards that are needed, or should a neutral "whoever can give us the best technical result the fastest" policy be adopted?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> The key is that we need technically sound, open standards, done quickly.  The utility industry also wants a robust, representative process for their development and maintenance.  Both accredited organizations and consortia with open, transparent processes will play a role.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Given the scope and complexity of the task at hand, do  you see ways in which industry and/or government agencies will need to work together differently than they have in the past in order to meet the Obama administrations ambitious goals on schedule?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> What is happening today in smart grid is very much like the automation of maintenance and operations in the nationwide telecommunications network that took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, only with today's computing and data networking technology.  A key difference is that in the telephone network, at that time, it was all owned by one company so coming up with a plan and setting standards was easier &mdash; it was done by Bell Labs.  Today's electric grid is owned and operated by 3100 electric utilities. It was never designed with an overall plan, and there has not been a need for standards-based interoperability until now.</p>
			<p>The standards work that has evolved is being done by 15 different organizations.  Someone has to coordinate it.  That is the job Congress asked NIST to do.  Fortunately, NIST has a long tradition of working side by side with industry in the voluntary consensus process, and industry seems to be comfortable with NIST taking on this role.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Which standards organizations do you see playing the most important roles in enabling the Smart Grid?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> IEEE, IEC, NEMA, NAESB, NERC, ISA, ASHRAE, ISO, NIST (cyber), SAE, OASIS, IETF, NFPA, UL, ZigBee Alliance, OpenSG Users Group, Open Geospatial Consortium, …  There will be more.  ANSI plays a very important role in defining requirements for a robust standards development process, and at least among the accredited organizations, helping to avoid overlaps in scope, and international engagement.</p>
			<p><strong>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Challenges Ahead</strong></p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Some commentators have said that we can move ahead with demonstrations and actual deployments today, while others have expressed concern that more standards need to be developed before incentive funds can efficiently be spent in the field.  Are there areas where you believe more standards must be developed before anything else can be done, and if so, what are those areas?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> We need to move ahead with the demonstration projects and deployments.  They will help validate the standards that are chosen.  The standards have to catch up and we are going to be driving the process hard.  Where necessary the standards will have to allow for gateways or adapters to accommodate "pre-standard" deployments.  Fortunately a lot of the standards are software-based, and even hardware can be updated with secure downloadable flash memory.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Private industry will be primarily responsible for developing the standards needed under the guidance of NIST, but Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may ultimately mandate compliance with some of these standards.  Is there precedence for this approach, and if so, what past initiatives come to mind?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> FERC has the regulatory authority to mandate standards.  They have this authority for the bulk and interstate power system, and for the reliability and security of the grid.  The state public utility commissions have similar regulatory authority at the distribution and retail level.  The enforcement authority they have is primarily through approval of utility rates &mdash; for example they can determine whether a utility can recover its investment in the grid in its rates.  We are trying to do something with the grid that has not been done before.  The interoperability in the telecommunications network is done almost entirely through voluntary standards, and it seems to work.  However the electric grid is much more fragmented (3100 utilities) and has more a tradition of using proprietary systems.  Some combination of voluntary and mandatory standards will likely be needed.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> What lessons can we learn from those past efforts?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> I think we are breaking new ground.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Standards have traditionally been set in niche-specific "silo" organizations, with only loose liaison relationships being created between organizations to lessen redundant efforts and increase synergy.  Will this approach work for creating the full network of Smart Grid standards, or will a different approach be needed in some cases?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> I think it will work.  There is not that much overlap between the organizations in what they are doing for the smart grid, and where there is, such as IEEE and IEC, there are cooperative development arrangements in place.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> The Obama Administration has launched several other ambitious standards-dependent policy initiatives, most notably the commitment to rapidly deploy Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on a national basis.  What are the standards-related challenges you see as being common &mdash; and not common &mdash; to enabling both EHRs and the Smart Grid?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> In designing our approach to the smart grid coordination effort, we studied what Health and Human Services did with the Healthcare IT Standards Panel.  We have adapted what we thought were the best features, and are taking a different approach in aspects that were less successful.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> The public-private processes that are developing in real time to create EHRs and the Smart Grid will certainly provide valuable lessons for the future of standards development. As a result, I'm interested in which aspects of the Healthcare IT Standards Panel's approach transfer well, and which Smart Grid needs require new approaches?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> Having a standing public/private sector panel administered by a neutral private-sector organization which recommends standards needed to achieve interoperability is a good model.  We do not plan to use the panel to develop the interoperability specifications.  For the smart grid, that work will be done by the standards development organizations.  There are hundreds of specifications needed, and we are fortunate to have fifteen or so organizations who are well-equipped to get the job done.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Standards groups are known for launching redundant efforts, especially where one vendor, or group of vendors, can gain a market advantage through having its technology win.  Do you expect this to be a big issue with Smart Grid standards, and what, if anything, do you think  the government should (or can) do to try and limit such activity?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> I have to say that so far I have not seen this to be a big problem.  There are a few cases of competitive standards but in the areas I have seen there is market demand for multiple solutions and our standards framework needs to accommodate it.  What has pleasantly surprised me is that everyone sees this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to redesign one of the most important infrastructures of the nation, and that if we do this right the pie gets bigger for everyone.  There is a level of cooperation that I have not seen before.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> Your personal involvement in the Smart Grid involves addressing security concerns.  Where do you see the greatest challenges in this area?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> A lot of the legacy systems deployed today were developed before the security standards and methodologies we have today existed.  "Security by obscurity" is a term I have heard used to describe some of the legacy proprietary systems. The smart grid uses the robust standards and tools we have today to design in security at both a technical and operational level.  For some time there will be a coexistence of legacy and new systems, and this will present challenges.</p>
			<p><strong>III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Smart Grid and the Future of Standards Development</strong></p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> As earlier noted, the history of standards development has been niche-focused, with individual organizations, staffed by interested participants, serving their own needs.  As standards-dependent networks become increasingly important, complex and global, this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate.  What does the Smart Grid challenge tell us about how the standards development infrastructure needs to evolve, and how should we go about encouraging it do so?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> It is helpful actually for standards organizations to have well-defined areas of expertise.  This works as long as there is a clearly defined coordination role accepted by government, industry, and the standards development community.  Having a clearly defined urgent national goal that everyone understands and supports is also very helpful.  Where we need to get better is in being more nimble in starting needed standards projects quickly, and dedicating industry and SDO resources more intensively to get standards done quickly, without so much dead time between meetings.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> In the United States, industry espouses a "bottom up," industry-led approach to standard setting, while many countries abroad follow a "top down," government-led approach.  Do you think that one process is better suited than the other to address complex challenges like enabling a Smart Grid, and do you think that the United States could learn any lessons from abroad in pursuing its Smart Grid goals?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> I think the smart grid is a perfect example of the reason the US is a world leader in so many fields.  The American way abhors "one size fits all" solutions and prizes innovation and flexibility.  In the smart grid we are capitalizing on our strength &mdash; a dynamic and flexible decentralized system &mdash; as well as our innovation in solving problems and spirit of public/private partnership &mdash; to find the right balance of "top down" and "bottom up" to achieve the coordination needed for the smart grid.</p>
			<p><em><strong>AU:</strong> What haven't I asked that I should have to complete this picture?</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>GA:</em></strong> It seems like a very big challenge.  Is this job doable?  Absolutely.  There are at least three major infrastructure transformations that have been successfully accomplished before: automation of operations for the telecommunications network in the 1970s/80s, development of the internet in the 1980s and 90s, and next generation telecom networks in this decade.  We have plenty of lessons learned that we can apply to successfully realize the smart grid.  We have no choice.  We cannot achieve the nation's goal of energy independence and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions unless we do this.</p>

			<h3>From the Ridiculous to the Sublime</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<img class="imgleft" src="apr09/apr09_img2.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="176" border="0" />
			<p>Long-time readers will know that whenever I can, I disappear into the desert for as long as I can.  Often, the opportunity arises as a result of a business trip, and so it is that I write this in northwestern Arizona a few days after spending a day at a standards client meeting in a conference room buried deep within the bowels of the raucous, random, blaring, unworldly nonsense that is otherwise known as the Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
			<p>Some of the nonsense worked to my favor, or at least amusement, as my $143.95 room reservation was unexpectedly traded up into a penthouse suite on the 62nd floor of the hotel &mdash; a suite that was bigger than the entire first floor of my admittedly small house, with 18 foot ceilings (the room, not my house), a wall of glass behind two sets of motorized drapes, a bar, living room, two bathrooms (one palatial), four flat screen TV sets (more than I have owned of any type in my entire life), and no coffee maker.</p>
			<p>But the rest of the complex was just acres and acres (and <em>acres</em> and <em>acres</em>) of slot machines, jumbled together restaurants, vast conference rooms and halls, and the worst signage on the face of the planet, both inside and out.  Applying logic, the only rational explanation is that the hotel security guards must spice up their tedious days staring at surveillance screens by randomly switching the arrows on signs to destinations such as "registration."</p>
			<p>What a hoot it must be tracking hapless guests as they spiral endlessly about the enormous gaming hall from camera to camera, heavy suitcases in tow, wandering desperately amid the flashing lights and thunderous din looking for the sanctuary of the check-in lobby.  One imagines the guards sitting there, laughing and betting on how many times they can trick this tired Kansan or that to circle the casino floor before finally stumbling, exhausted and desperate, through the only narrow (and naturally unmarked) exit that allows escape into the lobby.</p>
			<p>Needless to say, the desert was looking pretty good by the time I escaped from the hotel myself in a four wheel drive car, heading south, and then east, on dirt roads that turned into jeep tracks as they wound into rugged, dry mountains graced with a blush of late spring flowers and the first cactus blossoms of the season.</p>
			<p>The weather was fine, and my relief palpable by the time I set up camp, and watched the colors of the sunset flare up in the western sky, and transform grandly, then subtly, and at last imperceptibly into a faint yellow aura silhouetting the high crags of the surrounding mountains, as Rigel and Betelgeuse, and then a host of other stars, silently emerged from the gathering dark of a crystalline, moonless night.  Happily, Vegas was too far over the horizon for even it's prodigious candle power to intrude in the distance an wash out the thousands of stars that were glowing into view.</p>
			<img class="imgright" src="apr09/apr09_img3.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="226" border="0" />
			<p>For which I was quite grateful.  I am a light sleeper, and one of my quiet pleasures in the fresh, clear air of a high desert night is watch the constellations wheel overhead when I wake up, and gauge the time by the location of those that I can recognize.  Majestically, the earth's rotation makes them seem to slowly rise and transit the vault of the impeccably dark, desert sky as the earth hurtles soundlessly underneath.</p>
			<p>After such a night and no matter how fitfully I may have slept, I wake up not so much refreshed as restored.  And the sound and fury of Las Vegas seems impossibly, but thankfully, far away</p>

			<h4>CONSIDER THIS:</h4>
			<h3><span class="red">#58</span> Googling to Newspaper Solvency</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>I am an avid, lifelong, reader of newspapers in general, and of the <em>New York Times</em> in  particular. Moreover,  I'm  a  staunch  believer  in  the  essential  role  of an<img class="imgleft" src="apr09/apr09_img4.gif" alt="" width="180" height="80" border="0" /><img class="imgright" src="apr09/apr09_img5.gif" alt="" width="180" height="80" border="0" /> press in a modern  democracy.   But  I'm also the owner of a Web site that serves over a million page views a month, some  of  which  display  short extracts of news articles, with links back to the full text.  On occasion those links lead back to stories appearing at the Web site of the <em>Times</em>.</p>
			<p>So why am I trying to kill my beloved <em>Times</em> and its worthy brethren?</p>
			<p>Well, in fact I'm not.  The real causes of newspaper distress are the diversion of ad dollars from print to on-line placements, and a plunge in the rates being paid for those same ads.  The latter results in part from the ever-increasing supply of ad-ready Web pages, and the development by Google of technology that allows inexpensive ads to be targeted at the pages most likely to generate sales.  That's not the way some newspaper owners and journalists see it, though.  They would like to charge Google, and even small "aggregators" like me, for the privilege of driving traffic back to their own ad-bearing Web sites.</p>
			<p>If you think that sounds backwards, you're right.  It also explains why Google's revenues are still rising while the <em>Times</em> continues to report substantial losses.  What Google realized years ago, but newspapers continue to miss, is the value of enlisting vast numbers of independent site owners (ISOs) as distributors.  By creating targeting technology that enables even low-volume products to be cost-effectively advertised via these distributors, Google was able to harness the full power of "long tail" economics to its business model.  Ads like these generate only pennies of revenue for Google and drag down ad rates overall, but Google's super-efficient technology platform allows it to more than compensate through volume.</p>
			<p>The only way for newspapers to survive on ad revenue, then, is to learn how to sell on-line ads faster than their print-based advertising and subscription revenues evaporate.  Surprisingly enough, they can &mdash; but only if they begin to emulate Google, rather than bash it.</p>
			<p>Here's how:  newspaper publishers need to start looking at aggregators as partners rather than enemies.  Publishers also need to see news snippets not as content, but as advertisements for the newspapers themselves.  By motivating ISOs to drive traffic back to the newspapers that underwrite the production of high quality content, publishers, like Google, can capture the long tail financial rewards to which they are entitled.</p>
			<p>For the <em>Times</em>, such a program would work like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbers">Launch a News Partner Program to encourage new ISOs to add automated news extract feeds to their sites, and incentivize existing aggregators to display only news from the <em>Times</em>.  Make it as easy for an ISO to participate as it is to join the Google AdSense program.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Limit an ISO's extract rights to six per day, and control the amount of content that will display at the ISO site, so that there is enough of the story to grab a reader's interest, but not to satisfy her curiosity.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">When an ISO reader generates ad revenue at the <em>Times</em> site, share 10% with the ISO.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Offer a default option that automatically matches news extracts with the content that is displaying on the same ISO page.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Empower ISOs by letting them customize what displays at their sites.  Allow them to choose from topics as broad as "politics" or as narrow as "digital photography."   Update the Times News Reader to allow ISOs to select individual stories simply by clicking on them.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Compete with Google by becoming an ad reseller, leveraging the relationship with ISO partners to generate further income.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">Give commissions to site owners for new print subscriptions that result from  promotional ads run at ISO sites.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Would this work?  Yes, because it would  be more appealing to ISOs and readers than the already wildly successful Google ad model, which produces only pennies a month for most ISOs, and displays ads, rather than interesting content, to visitors.</p>
			<p>While simply allowing bloggers and others to syndicate small extracts of news stories would not be likely to generate enough ad revenue to save the <em>Times</em> and its peers from economic perdition, it could be an important first step in transitioning the world of print media into a digital future where it can more successful leverage its unique strengths and resources.  By forging loyal networks of nimble ISOs, the <em>Times</em>, like Google, would gain the partners it needs in order to adapt to the challenges of on-line business as they continue to evolve.</p>
			<p>It's a win-win proposition.  And I can't be the only loyal <em>Times</em>-reading ISO who is standing by, just waiting for the invitation.</p>

			<h3>Prejudice, Prehistory and the Puzzle of Pictographs</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<blockquote><em>The following piece was written in northeastern Arizona during a recent hiking and camping trip</em></blockquote>
			<img class="imgleft" src="apr09/apr09_img6.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="183" border="0" />
			<p>The southwestern landscape hosts a variety of signature geologic forms, some of which have become iconic as the backdrops for countless western movies.  If you should find yourself channel surfing late tonight, a single frame of a mesa, butte, spire or hoodoo will instantly lock you on to the genre, even before the dusty characters ride into view.</p>
			<p>The desert rock garden is a less well known type, but it will be familiar to anyone who has spent any time knocking about the southwest, and around Arizona in particular.  Unlike the angular, striated spires and hoodoos that erode out of sedimentary formations, rock gardens are more often volcanic in origin than not, usually granitic, and rounded in form, characteristically resembling enormous blowups of the sand dribbles that a child makes at the beach by allowing a slurry of water and sand to slip through her fingers.</p>
			<p>While you might not recognize them as easily, rock gardens have as authentic a place in western history as do the Painted Desert landscapes so beloved by Hollywood directors: when Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid led their Hole in the Wall gang through the hole in the wall, the passageway they took led into a rock garden.  You can find it in Joshua Tree National Park.  It's a beautiful labyrinth, and well worth a visit.</p>
			<p>Today my Jeep track took me by just such a rock garden quite a long way from anywhere, and a few hundred acres in size.  It was mid-morning, the sun was shining, and ravens circled the eroding granite plutons that rose from the desert floor to form globular eminences riven with fissures, and pocked with erosional cavities.  It seemed  like a good time and place to use a hunt for rock art as an excuse to take a walk.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/rockart/">Rock art</a> can be found throughout the southwest, and less commonly in other parts of the United States as well.  Unlike the breathtakingly lifelike cave paintings of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting">aurochs and  horses</a> in the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Magnon">Cro-Magnon</a> caves of France and Spain, the rock art of the southwest is figurative rather than literal.  Devoid of the cultural context in which these paintings (pictographs) and pecked out images (petroglyphs) were created, the rock art of the southwest teases more than it tells, leading those that would attempt to interpret it to refer to enigmatic figures as "wizards," "monsters" and the like.  Here in the clear bright light of the desert, surrounded by panoramic views of the world in which the long-gone artists lived, these shapes are compelling, because they so clearly tell stories that we cannot understand.</p>
			<img class="imgright" src="apr09/apr09_img7.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="238" border="0" />
			<p>Therein lies the great and largely hopeless challenge of archaeology &mdash; an inherently limited and imperfect effort, part craft and part science, that attempts the impossible task of resurrecting the reality of extinct societies from the random artifacts related to their lives that have managed to survive.  In this context, rock art is especially fascinating and frustrating.</p>
			<p>Fascinating, because we can so much more clearly glimpse the creative and spiritual consciousness of those that lived long ago from a painting than we can from a bone awl.  But also frustrating, because our vision is so inadequate to interpret what we see.  We simply can't, at this long remove and without the world view that informed the artist, truly know what to make of what has been left behind.</p>
			<p>Without the back-story to petroglyphs and pictographs, archaeologists are left to work with more empirical material: stones and bones, seeds and pollen, pottery shards both painted and plain, and datable charcoal.  But looking only to such remnants makes it too easy to consign those that left such limited clues behind to a state of primitive social and mental development.  Until the last century, this practice made it easy to deny recognizing archaic peoples as the complex, creative, ingenious human beings they in fact were, notwithstanding the fact that they were anatomically identical &mdash; and therefore of equal intellectual potential &mdash; to ourselves.  Sadly, the same attitude was applied throughout the so-called Age of Discovery (surely an interesting turn of phrase to those often sophisticated and ancient cultures that were "discovered") to all of those living in less developed parts of the world.  Worse, it was used by colonialists as an excuse to exploit those that they conveniently concluded were members of inferior races.</p>
			<p>Have we truly advanced beyond this prejudice today?  To answer that question, it is useful to examine not only what we do, but also what we say.  When we do, we find that there are clues to be found in the words we use that reflect ongoing prejudices of which we may be less than aware.  Consider, for example, the curious and condescending term, "prehistory."</p>
			<p>As used by archaeologists and academics, prehistory encapsulates the entire period of human existence that predates the invention of writing.  Taken literally, "prehistory" implies that "history" simply did not exist before it could be recorded, notwithstanding the fact that our "historical" era constitutes the very thinnest veneer on the surface of human temporal existence.</p>
			<p>What a judgmental word to use, given that <em>homo sapiens</em> has been expanding its dominance of the earth for at least 100,000 years (plus or minus a few score millennia, depending on who you talk to), and besting wooly mammoths and mastodons with stone and wooden weapons much of the time along the way.  No mean feat, especially when compared to the heavy weaponry a modern hunter would never dream of entering the African savannah without today.  And our more distant tool and fire making ancestors first made their way out of Africa hundreds of thousands of years before that.</p>
			<p>The written record of a society's accomplishments and culture, after all, help earn it a measure of legitimacy and equality in the competitive world we live in.  In the absence of such an acknowledged record, it is easier for those bent on exploitation to relegate a culture to second class status, or dismiss its people as outright savages whose right to exist can be effectively ignored.  the lot of illiterate aboriginal peoples at the hands of western civilization (another curious word, in this context) has therefore not been a happy one, despite the fact that most of the Europeans and Americans that first crossed the Atlantic could themselves neither read nor write.</p>
			<div class="calloutright">

			<p>The problem is this:  without a written record, how are a society's accomplishments to be recorded and preserved in a way that makes them accessible, understandable and worthy of current respect?  Sadly,  we have no idea what great advances may have been made in the more distant past, because not all great civilizations leave ruins of great temples.  And yet, archaeologists are finding tantalizing examples of what has come before.  Only now, for example, has the existence of vanished cities in the Amazon been confirmed, because the civilizations that built them had no usable building stone with which to build.</p>
			<p>But those cities are long gone.  In a horrific pattern that repeated itself throughout the Americas, European-borne diseases rapidly destroyed the social structure of virtually every sophisticated society that existed at the time of Columbus.  Sometimes, the collapse occurred even before Europeans arrived on the scene, as diseases like smallpox and measles worked their way inland via native trade contacts.</p>
			<p>By the time widespread European settlement began, the descendents many of these complex societies had reverted to a hunter-gatherer existence, as was the case with the ostensibly vanished (but in fact still nearby) inhabitants of the fabled "lost cities" of the Amazon basin.  Long before the Spanish moved upriver, these great centers of indigenous society had decayed and fallen, and the jungle had reclaimed the roads that connected and the plantations that surrounded them.  And yet now we learn that 1500 years ago the same societies that built these cities developed a way to fertilize their fields by working charcoal, pottery shards and fish bones into the soil, creating a rich mixture capable of maintaining fertility for many years.  Scientists now refer to the results as  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta">terra preta</a></em>.</p>
			<p>In the aggregate, the <em>terra preta</em> fields discovered to date comprise an area as large as France &mdash; and the potential of this ancient technique is  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89562594">now being explored</a> not only for its potential to revitalize Third World agricultural, but as an environmentally sound and inexpensive method to sequester carbon dioxide in order to alleviate global warming.  In contrast, modern agricultural science is incapable of sustaining agriculture in the Amazon for more than a few years after virgin jungle is cleared.  Whose technology, then, is more advanced?  Our modern, energy intensive, polluting, petrochemical-based agricultural methods of transient efficacy, or the more creative and sustainable techniques developed by these long forgotten, supposedly primitive, prehistorians?</p>

			<p>Or consider the achievement of the aboriginal people of Australia, who arrived in the antipodes more than 40,000 years ago. The date is remarkable, because at that time Australia was more than 200 miles from the nearest land (which was itself an archipelago of often widely separated islands).  In order to reach their destination, the first Australians needed to develop and build seaworthy boats of significant size, and develop impressive navigational skills as well.  Moreover, their voyages of discovery demanded a degree of daring and determination equal to that of Columbus, as they sailed over the horizon and into the unknown to reach their new home.  Many years later, the Polynesians colonized the entire Pacific, crossing incomparably more vast and unknown distances of open ocean.</p>
			<p>Who knows what other great but forgotten accomplishments humanity attained before western society invented "history?"</p>
			<p>While we will doubtless never discover a fraction of these deeds, I expect that we will learn enough over time for thoughtful people to conclude that the accomplishments of the artists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux">Lascaux</a> and the mariners of Australia were not aberrations, but representative of the attainments of many of the waves of advancement that washed up, albeit only for a time, upon the shores of human development, only to recede into the unremembered depths of what moderns regard as prehistory.</p>
			<p>One of the waves we are aware of washed up on the shores of the American southwest, only to be pulled back by an as-yet poorly understood confluence of forces that at minimum included a devastating drought.  But before the abandonment of the Four Corners area of the Southwest, those that lived in the early centuries of the last millennium built impressive, communal stone buildings as many as five stories in height, laid out roads connecting their outlying communities with their cultural centers, and established trade networks that extended into Mezzo America.  The traces of their existence can be found everywhere in the southwest, in scatters of stone flakes left behind by tool makers, in pottery shards marking places of habitation, in granaries perched high on cliff walls, in the remnants of complex irrigation systems &mdash; and in the enigmatic rock art of countless artists that will ever remain to us unknown.</p>

				<p>How different might things have been if these cultures had developed writing? Would they have earned greater respect?</p>

			<p>The lot of Native North Americans, of course, was no happier than that of their Amazonian kindred.  As elsewhere in the western hemisphere, indigenous peoples were almost invariably regarded as being less than the equals of their conquerors, and even less than human.  This, notwithstanding the fact that the great cities and earthworks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adena_culture">Adena</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopewell_tradition">Hopewell</a> cultures in the Mississippi river valley were the equal in size to the largest contemporary cities and defenses in Europe.  But like the Amazonians, the societies that built great cities like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahokia">Cahokia</a> &mdash; which includes what may be the largest pyramid in the world &mdash; soon collapsed after first contact.  Those that rediscovered the remains of these complex and successful societies insisted that they must have been built by "lost civilizations," even the Lost Tribes of Israel, rather than the ancestors of living Native Americans.  When I was in school, the existence of these highly developed civilizations was never even mentioned.</p>

			<p>How different might things have been if these cultures had developed writing, or if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_codices">Codices of the Maya</a> had been translated and widely read, rather than burned by Spanish priests as heretical writings?  Would they have earned greater respect and better treatment for indigenous peoples?</p>
			<p>Perhaps not after all.  But what richness of understanding about our common history as human beings was lost when these largely unrecorded societies collapsed under the onslaught of western guns, germs and steel.  Instead, we are left only with the durable detritus that archaeologists pore over, and the rock art that hikers stumble upon as they range across the vast and empty expanses of the southwest.</p>

			<p>I wasn't surprised that my time spent roaming through this particular rock garden today yielded little.  As it happened, most of the granite was disintegrating rather than firm in the protected places where rock art might often be found.  But at last, I found a single panel on a wall of competent granite, hidden under an overhang and shielded from the weather.  The panel had but two elements, one in grey-green pigment and the other in white, the latter making opportunistic use of a cluster of quartz crystals to capture and reflect more light.  The first, low down, was a many rayed sun, while the second floated higher and to its right &mdash; a small, solitary, serene moon.</p>
			<p>That was all that this artist had to share on whatever long ago day she was moved to take up her brush and pot of paint.  Perhaps she may have been one of those last Anasazi, the ones who abandoned this region to migrate to locations still largely unknown.  If so, these images at least serve to recall her existence, and that of all those other ones who had made these harshly beautiful lands their home.  Perhaps the message of the departing artist was simply to proclaim, "Once we lived here.  Know this, now that we are gone."</p>
