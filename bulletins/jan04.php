                <p align="left" class="style2">If there was a Time Magazine of information technology (IT), it might well have anointed the new respectability of IT Standards as the technology story of the year. Stated another way, 2003 is the year in which the &quot;information&quot; part of ICT (information and communications technology) standards achieved a new legitimacy that may have been lacking even a year ago, and that certainly did not exist in the early 1990's. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Ten years ago, hardware, silicon and software information technology standards were something that many people talked about, but few really believed in. When IT standards were acknowledged as being effective, it was rarely open standards, reached through a consensual process, that people had in mind. Instead, admiring comments (made openly or grudgingly) were most often reserved for the &quot;de facto&quot; standards imposed by market power, innovation or good luck, or a combination of all three factors. The holy grail of a decade ago was to be the proprietary owner of the rights in a dominant technology -- to be the Microsoft of operating systems, or the Novell of network software. Open standards efforts, in contrast, were often launched in a rarely successful, Canute-like effort to turn back the tide of already established proprietary dominance. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Such is not the case today. Now, most companies compete to influence the creation of open standards, realizing that their ability to achieve proprietary dominance is either unlikely, due to competitive forces, or impossible. Why impossible? Because only open standards can enable the technology platform upon which new goods and services can be offered (think wireless phones and the Internet). Even where such cooperation is not essential, the world has changed to a point where other stakeholders in the roll out of new technology have little patience with vendors that want to have it all. Witness, for example, the unfolding drama in the DVD Forum today. Here, many of the same companies that clashed in the VHS-Betamax wars of the 1970s are being nudged by other market players towards a consensus solution, as consumers await the next generation of DVD products (see: <strong><em><a href="/blog/index.php#beta">Betamax and the Blu-Ray group: Will History Repeat Itself?</a></em></strong> ) </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In consequence, standards have become &quot;news&quot; in their own right, with more and more coverage appearing not just in the technical press addressing technical issues for a technical audience, but in the business press as well. Today, standards stories come in many flavors: they cover the jockeying between the giants in new areas of opportunity, such as web standards; the competition between standards-based products in areas like wireless (will it be Bluetooth or WiFi that dominates the marketplace?); the penetration of new standards-based products in areas such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags; and the market fallout of the fortunes of one side or the other in court cases involving standards, such as the JEDEC standards at the core of the ongoing Rambus saga. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">What is at the heart of this transition? Certainly, the reasons include the following: </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; The acronym &quot;IT Standards&quot; has become &quot;ICT Standards&quot;. In other words, market demand for wide area networks, and the advent of wireless and other communications-based products and services have caused the world of IT standard setting and communications technology standard setting to collide and, in many cases, merge. Standards are not an option, but a necessity, once one breaks out of the single-owner, single site network. This convergence has had not only a technical, but a psychological impact -- traditional IT players can see that consensus-based standard setting can work. Creating common standards upon which companies can offer their own competitive, value-added solutions is not just a mouthful of high-minded words, but a real opportunity. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; The Internet and the Web have created means of interconnection that eradicate the ability to exercise certain types of traditional proprietary control: not only due to technical realities, but because other stakeholders would simply deem proprietary control to be intolerable. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; 2003 is the year that Linux truly broke out into commercial legitimacy, notwithstanding the efforts of SCO to stake a claim to profit from anyone's use of the open system. With the acceptance of open source as an area of profitable opportunity by major players such as IBM, yet another blow was struck to the assumption that growth and prosperity can only be based upon proprietary solutions. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In short, standards have become a given, rather than an option, in many areas of strategic planning, as well as technical R&amp;D. Increasingly, standards are accepted as a legitimate tool to achieve commercial ends, rather than a smokescreen to cover other stratagems. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Perhaps the greatest evidence of this new legitimacy is the degree to which companies are now seeking unfair advantages in setting otherwise-consensus based standards, rather than seeking to impose their own de facto solutions upon the marketplace. It may be tepid good news to know that even more gamesmanship has moved into the standard-setting tent, but good news it is. Why? Because the games mean that standards have arrived, and because process controls, vigilance and joint action can better restrict gamesmanship in a controlled setting than they can in a wide-open marketplace. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In some ways, 2003 marks the end of the frontier years of IT commerce, and the beginning of a more self-regulated era, when more and more commercial players acknowledge that the benefits of joint action will in many cases outweigh the risks of going it alone. The ultimate beneficiaries will be the buyers of ICT products and services, who will enjoy broader offerings of products and services, safer decisions to deploy new technologies, longer useful product lives, and more competitive pricing. All of which is welcome news, in these days of constrained spending for buyers, and narrowing margins for sellers who can scarce afford to commit to the wrong strategic direction. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">So perhaps we should all look back at 2003 in a more kindly light than we may have before. With IT standards coming of age, there is greater hope for a more rational and predictable commercial future. And who wouldn't look forward to that? </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">It is axiomatic that the only good standard is an implemented standard -- and that (at least by this definition) there are far too many bad standards that have been created over the years. Too often, a commitment to consensus or infighting can result in watered down standards, and many times the process time has exceeded the market's patience to await the result. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">It is by this measure that we acclaim wireless technologies to be the standard setting area of the year. From wireless phones to Wi-Fi enabled laptops to RFID tags for everything, there are a host of wireless standards that are already implemented, or are in the process of being added to purchasing requirements. These standards come in all stages of development, refinement and sophistication, and have been developed by all types of standard setting organizations (SSOs). Moreover, there were few areas of commercial and consumer life that have been unaffected by the implementation of these standards, from road warriors connecting to the mother ship to third-world people gaining their first direct access to the outside world. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But great as this impact may have been, it is certain to be only a suggestion of what is to come, as geospatial information systems (GIS) standards enable more and more location based services, RFID tags are used to track ever-more pedestrian items, more and more wireless-enabled devices find their way into cars, products, kiosks, and a host of other as-yet unanticipated wireless products and services are conceived and implemented. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Highlights of the year were many. Here are but a few: </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>To Wi-Fi or not to Wi-Fi? </em></strong>In a sometimes chaotic, but ultimately productive, example of multiple standard setting processes setting competing solutions against each other, the market narrowed down to just two: the IEEE-developed 802.11 family of standards popularly referred to by the short hand name of &quot;Wi-Fi&quot;, and the beguilingly named, competing &quot;Bluetooth&quot; standard. The press enjoyed covering the two standards as if they were a horse race, as well as the further development of new standards flavors within the Wi-Fi family. Meanwhile, vendors scrambled to decide which standard (or standards, for those that wished to hedge their bets in such a fast-moving situation) to deploy in their products. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In truth, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth were each largely targeted at different markets (the former, with a significantly larger range, being most appropriate for effortlessly deploying a home network, and the latter being a good choice for eliminating the wires connecting a PC to its printer and mouse in a single office). By year's end, Wi-Fi seemed the clear choice for home users and large office installations, while Bluetooth's best hopes appeared to be in more limited and particular types of usage. At the same time, some early commercial bets paid off, while others did not: home Wi-Fi use exploded, while investments in public-space Wi-Fi &quot;hot spots&quot; proved (so far) to find few paid users. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">On the horizon, there are other wireless standards in contemplation, as vendors look for the best cost and technical solution to each set of problems. Some may cost just pennies to deploy, in contrast to the more substantial costs for both Bluetooth and wireless. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Here is a sampling of the wireless news we covered in this application area this year: </p>

              <p align="center" class="style2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/bulletins/sep.gif" width="203" height="23"></font></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>RFID Tags: The Customer Speaks: </em></strong>Standards usually represent a forward-looking strategy by vendors, whereby the investment in setting standards is intended to lower the risk of product introduction. Hopefully, creation of a standard will enable the near-simultaneous introduction of a broad array of products and services that can interoperate. This, in turn, is intended to tempt customers into making their own investment in the newly introduced product or service that the standard makes possible. Sometimes the investment pays off, and sometimes it does not. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In the case of RFID tags, there were many who said that the technology and the standards might not pay off, and their doubts were not without foundation. After all, early R&amp;D efforts could only produce tags at certain size and price, and the tags required an antenna to boot (albeit a small one). Anyone who decided to deploy the new technology would need to make a substantial investment in the readers and other related infrastructure, as well as buy a tag for every item that they wished to track. Add to this the risk that, absent common agreement among vendors on the standards that they would support, an early adopter might find that it had made a big investment in technology, only to find that its investment quickly became obsolete (at which time the same adopter might see its more conservative competitors make safer, cheaper purchasing decisions). Small wonder that many analysts thought that the day when RFID tags became ubiquitous might be later rather than sooner, if ever. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">All that changed when Wal-Mart, the 900-pound gorilla of global retail, decided to require its largest suppliers to deploy RFID technology if they wished to continue to do business with what was often their largest customer. Not long after, the U.S. Department of Defense made the same decision. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As a result, the standards investment calculus was turned on its head almost overnight: First, a vendor had no choice but to implement, if Wal-Mart or the DOD was a large customer. Second, a vendor would know that its competitors would need to make a contemporaneous investment, lowering the risk of loss of business to competitors based on price. Third, whatever technology Wal-Mart blessed would be likely to become a de facto standard, ensuring at least a near-term return on the immediate technology investment. Fourth, the potential business and volumes resulting from the guaranteed market for RFID products would cause per-tag prices to drop, and ensure rewards to those technology vendors that made the investment in miniaturization and other necessary advancements. Fifth, once vendors make the necessary investment to serve these two customers, they will have a strong incentive to capitalize on their investment by providing incentives to other customers to adopt the same technology. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">And finally, the existence of a robust standard-setting process gave confidence that the standards would be effective, adopted, and durable. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The result? As great assurance as it is possible to have that adopting a new standards-based technology will be a sound investment. One can only assume that, as a result of the requirements decisions of these two huge customers, that the utilization of RFID technology has been accelerated by a factor of years. And after the initial pain, even the vendors required to be the first implementers may prove to be the long-term beneficiaries, as their experience and capabilities will exceed that of their later-adopting competitors. A happy story for all. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Well, perhaps not all. The concept of being able to attach a hidden, traceable tag to everything from a car to a tube of toothpaste leaves many privacy advocates uneasy. The impact of these concerns even caused Wal-Mart to engage in some public repositioning. But standards efforts are being applied to address privacy fears as well, with new features being designed that can, for example, deactivate an RFID tag when it passes by a reader at a store's front door. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The following selection of news stories and <strong><em>CSB </em></strong> comments shows how quickly this story moved during the year, taking RFID tags from an interesting new technology to projected rapid commercial deployment. </p>

Since then, privacy advocates have increasingly focused on the feared potential for tagged products to continue to supply information after they leave the store. Despite the pledge of RFID manufacturers to install &quot;kill switches&quot; to disable RFID tags as they leave the store, concerns remain - and Wal-Mart has cancelled its RFID-based &quot;smart shelf&quot; pilot program. </p>

Our guess is that they will eventually be ubiquitous (unless they are leapfrogged by some new, yet-to-be-released technology), with the greater question being how soon prices and antenna sizes both reduce to the point where the broad incorporation of RFID tags becomes inevitable. The first two articles below report on efforts being launched in Las Vegas and Chicago to familiarize the marketplace with the joys of RFID, both within and without the four walls of commercial establishments, while the third article focuses on efforts to quell the fears of those who feel that there are enough eyes looking over their shoulders already. </p>

But the more expensive elements of RFID-based systems will be evolving rapidly for some time, thus offering the risk for early obsolescence for early adopter/purchasers of such systems. What to do, if you're a defense contractor or a major supplier to Wal-Mart? One analyst identifies the following as a key element of any early-adopter deployment strategy:</p>
              <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Invest in open standards, such as XML, as much as possible. If a company ties an RFID system to proprietary software processes, it will be locked into out-of-date technology almost as soon as its deployment is complete.

Indeed, GSM telephones passed the <span class="style54"><em>billion</em><em>-user </em></span>mark and membership in the GSM Association surpassed the <strong><em>200-country member </em></strong>mark. At the same time, there was increasing global cooperation among nations and regions to allocate and agree upon radio frequencies for new services - an imperative given greater urgency by the addition of wireless features to medical devices, such as pacemakers. And on May 16, Iraq became the newest member of the GSMA, as the American reconstruction force sought to restore the communications infrastructure of the defeated country. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Indeed, during 2003, it became clear that pervasive mobile-only phone use will not remain a third-world phenomenon, as many first world users transferred their home phone numbers to their mobile accounts -- and sometimes terminated their land line accounts as well. In 2004, the big news may turn back to land-line based services, as independents force even the major carriers to offer flat-fee, unlimited Voice Over IP (VoIP) services -- based on yet another set of standards. But the appeal of VoIP includes its emerging capacity to handle instantaneous delivery of huge amounts of data, such as video streams -- services that are not (yet) in great demand for deployment on a tiny mobile phone screen. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">At the same time, a wealth of standards have been developed to enable mobile phone users to handle everything from financial transactions to text messages while on the go.

              <p align="left" class="style2">Summarizing the depth, as well as the breadth, of standards activity in 2003 in any sort of concise fashion is a tall order. Where does one begin, with a year that saw events as diverse as the surprise court victory of Rambus, the JEDEC process bad boy; the launch of a bewildering (and sometimes competitive) array of Web Services initiatives, sometimes at the rate of more than one a week; the increasing use of standards as national and regional trade barriers by Europe and China; and, just for good measure, the announcement on New Year's Eve that Tim Berners-Lee would receive a knighthood? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">While this litany suggests the diversity of standards news in the year just ended, it still leaves out many important topics, such as the growing global focus on standards as a way to achieve equality of opportunity, or the coming into its own of the open source movement, or the ongoing clash between the legitimate rights of patent holders and the needs of standards implementers. Or the encouraging fact that the U.S. Federal government is showing increasing interest in facilitating the development and employment of standards. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This article therefore necessarily focuses on only some of the highpoints and trends of 2003, with the goal of providing a perspective on a very active year indeed.

              <p align="left" class="style10"><em>I. Emerging Standard Area of the Year: Web Services: </em></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">If wireless standards implementations were everywhere, heavy bets were placed by all of the big IT players that Web services implementations would not be far behind. Indeed, while other emerging standards areas -- such as grid computing -- gained attention, it sometimes seemed as if more initiatives were launched by more organizations in the area of Web services than in all other IT areas combined. The question was, whether the much-touted promises of this new technical approach would be realized, or whether it would prove to under deliver, as have so many other grand designs in the past. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Another area of attention was the politicking and maneuvering that surrounded the choice of venues for particular standards initiatives. With a number of well respected organizations already active in this area, some were displeased when a number of companies led by Microsoft and IBM crafted a new specification ( BPEL4WS 1.1 ) and offered it not to the W3C, which many regarded as the appropriate home for this particular standard, but OASIS instead. Some saw this decision as the sign of a fragmenting industry, while others found a segmentation among standard setting organizations to be healthy and appropriate, with the W3C continuing to manage foundational standards, and other organizations (such as OASIS) focusing on higher level standards. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Similarly, the formation of the Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) in February of 2002 by Accenture, BEA Systems, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP could be taken in two ways. Officially, its founders announced that they had identified a new set of tasks that needed attention in order to facilitate the launch of the web services model, including the development of deliverables such as profiles of web services standards suites, the use of which could facilitate the rapid deployment of web services. Rather than seeking to interest an existing standards organization in achieving this goal, they elected to found a new entity charged with creating profiles and related tools, and promoting the pervasive implementation of web services. In effect, WS-I would sit &quot;upstream&quot; of the standards process by letting existing organizations know what they hoped to see produced, and also &quot;downstream&quot; from the same process, blessing those suites of standards that they believed best addressed their goals. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">So was the formation of WS-I a novel and admirable evolution of the standard setting art, or a clever effort by a subset of companies to have greater influence through creating WS-I than they could achieve working through the existing organizations? Opinions, of course, differed, with conspiracy theories providing more titillating story lines than sober analyses of causes and effects. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As a result of the explosion of interest, we dedicated the May issue of the Consortium Standards Bulletin to the topic of &quot;<a href="/bulletins/may03.php#editorial">Who Should Set the Standards for Web Services?</a>&quot; The issue profiled WS-I and included a survey of three of the main Web services standards bodies -- W3C, OASIS and WS-I -- giving them a chance to describe how each saw its role and its relationship with the other standard setting organizations in the field (&quot;<a href="/bulletins/may03.php#featured">The Role of Standards Bodies: In Their Own Words</a>&quot;) </p>

The following stories highlight two unusual dynamics at work in this area, each a product of the perceived size of the opportunity and the speed believed by the major players to be necessary to secure the greatest advantage. While historically, companies sought either to set proprietary standards or work through SDOs or consortia to create open industry standards, those two techniques are now merging as ad hoc coalitions of companies race to create draft specifications, and then persuade existing bodies to take them up, complete them and endorse them. The second story highlights a different sort of ad hoc coalition, in this case one that hopes to convince customers that Web Services are real enough to buy. In both of these processes, some strange bedfellows are coming together. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>II. Homeland Security, Wireless Security, All Kinds of Security:</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing concerns over terrorism, ubiquitous links between networks and the Internet, and the burgeoning of wireless devices of all types, standards have become ever more important in the area of security. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In the area of Homeland Security, standards bodies and their allies not only set new standards, but assessed technologies, convened plenaries to address security issues, and issued warnings where compliance with available standards was poor. For example, NIST, the American National Institute of Standards and Technology, issued a study on the advancing state of the art in facial recognition systems and proposed performance standards by which deployed equipment should be judged, while BSI, the British Standards Institute sounded the alarm, when it learned that only 85% of UK companies were adhering to its security standards. ANSI, the American National Standards Institute, for its part launched its new Security Standards Panel, bringing over 200 experts together for a two day meeting to address Homeland Security issues. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Congress recognized the role of standards in addressing Homeland Security issues as well. On October 2, the National Preparedness Standards Act (H.R. 3227) was introduced in the House of Representatives. The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish clearly defined standards and guidelines: &quot;in consultation with other Federal agencies, State and local emergency responder agencies and officials, and standard-setting bodies from the emergency responder community,...for Federal, State, and local government emergency preparedness and response capability, including for training, interoperable communication systems, and response equipment.&rdquo; </p>
              <div align="left"><span class="style2">The full range of standards efforts were applied to this cause, as new consortia were formed, existing consortia launched new initiatives, and accredited SDOs formed new standards working groups. Examples include the Open Security Exchange (<a href="http://www.opensecurityexchange.org/" target="_off">http://www.opensecurityexchange.org/</a> ), a new consortium formed in April by four leading security solutions providers to define best practices and promote standards for integrating the management of security devices and policies across the enterprise. Similarly, OASIS, the well-established consortium that is a leader in the area of XML and related standards, completed work on its Security Assertion Markup Language. And INCITS, the broad-based SDO launched, launched four new task groups to develop biometrics standards to identify IT users. </span>

For example, standards-enabled technologies are essential to ensure an immediate and coordinated response to terror threats by emergency workers, hospitals, and the military. Communication, GIS and other standards become particularly important when coordinated responses are required by multiple, otherwise unrelated resources. Standards organizations are actively cooperating to help develop the type of coherent standards infrastructure that is required to meet the recommendations and needs of the Department of Homeland Security. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style10"><em>III. Intellectual Property Rights:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></span>2003 saw perhaps the most intense level of activity ever in the area of intellectual property rights (IPR). While many of the events that sparked this activity received ample press coverage, the responses of scores of SSOs to those events went almost totally unreported. In each case, the efforts of these SSOs involved a reexamination of the proper balance between the rights of intellectual property owners and the needs of standard setting. A subtext was whether or not the U.S. patent laws made sense in the world of ICT, and whether these same laws are being properly applied. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The first event that captured the attention of the standards community was the upset victory in January of Rambus over Infineon in its appeal to the Federal Circuit Court ( <em>see &quot;Litigation&quot;, below, for a detailed review of the substance and process of this case </em>) in January. While day traders in Rambus stock were stridently of the opinion that Rambus was the innocent victim of a cabal of chip manufacturers, actual participants in the standard setting world were largely of the opinion that Rambus had &quot;gamed&quot; the system, and had been relieved when a Virginia court had earlier ruled decisively in favor of Infineon, which Rambus had claimed owed it royalties for implementing a JEDEC semiconductor standard. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">While a few earlier cases had raised awareness of the importance of SSO intellectual property rights (IPR) policies, no ruling caught the attention of companies large and small as did the Rambus decision -- not least because the royalties at issue have been estimated to exceed $1 billion. Suddenly, IPR policies were elevated from the status of dry, difficult to agree upon, dull policies to dry, difficult to agree upon -- but vitally important policies. Having an industrial strength IPR policy became a precondition for new consortia to gather needed members, and existing organizations were forced to review their own policies to see if they would fare better than JEDEC's. Many came to the uncomfortable conclusion that their policies were out of date and, perhaps, just as vague as that of JEDEC. Most bit the bullet and embarked upon the sometimes painful process of amending and updating both their IPR policies, as well as their procedural rules. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The second event that commanded attention was the successful culmination of the three-year marathon effort of the World Wide Web Consortium to revise its IPR rules. Here, the focus was on the battle between those that favored creating a royalty-free zone within which all Web and Internet standards would reside, and those that owned extensive IPR portfolios. The resulting &quot;Patent Policy&quot;, announced in final draft form in March and later taking put into effect, made it virtually (but not absolutely) impossible for the W3C to knowingly approve a standard that might involve a payment of some nature to an IPR owner. The fact that this conclusion could be reached, notwithstanding the involvement of some of the largest IPR owners in the ICT world, heartened champions of open standards without price tags. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The third event that caught the attention of all was the surprise patent litigation victory by a tiny (one employee) company named Eolas Technologies over Microsoft, the largest software company in the world <em>(see &quot;Litigation&quot;, below, for more on this case) </em>. The patent involved some important Web browsing features, and offered a sober reminder to all that the best laid plans of IPR policy draftspersons are effective, at best, only against SSO members. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">A final, and barely noticed, story was the release by the FTC of a report on certain aspects of the extensive hearings that it had held in 2002 jointly with the Department of Justice. The FTC report was strongly critical of a number of aspects of the U.S. patent process, and advocated a number of reforms, based on the testimony of multiple industry experts. These reforms would address many of the most severe critiques of the patent system as it affects the ICT industry today. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Ultimately, it was a year that was not only eventful, but productive as well, as SSOs and their members all vastly increased their collective and individual knowledge of best practices in the area of IPR process and rights balancing. The resulting upgrading of IPR policies to state-of-the-art standards by consortia many will benefit the industry for many years to come.

              <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style10"><em>IV. International: </em></span>Standards have always comprised a sort of &quot;Chinese box&quot; reality: local standards coexist with national standards, which in turn must (ideally) coordinate with international standards. And at the same time, different national initiatives may be pursuing the same challenges at the same time, and competing consortia and/or SDOs may similarly be addressing the same goals at the same time. Under the best conditions of good will and cooperation, this presents a logistical challenge, as efforts need to be reconciled, and (where appropriate) global standards eventually endorsed by the appropriate international bodies. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In 2003, some of the most significant news did not involve how things worked well, or even how the process broke down, but how globalism was deliberately thwarted as countries like China sought to ensure that the high tech products that its citizens purchased were manufactured at home. Major technology corporations, in turn, concluded that it was better to play the game by China's rules rather than risk being shut out of this mammoth market, and announced plans to build to the new local standards. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Similarly, Europe continued to be proactive in setting standards for the members of the EC, as well as in rationalizing patent, copyright and trademark laws and requirements throughout the region. Belatedly, the United States began to take official notice of this trend, and legislation that is in part responsive has been introduced in Congress ( <em>see &quot;Legislation&quot; below </em>). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But not all of the news was about going separate ways. For example, ISO/IEC issued a new guide intended to increase the efficiency of international trade by lowering the cost and effort of &quot;conformity assessment&quot; activities (i.e., verification that goods that crossed borders conform to locally mandated standards). The new guides provide for one-time testing, with internationally acceptance of the resulting certification of conformance. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Similarly, within months of the cessation of initial hostilities, the United States was calling for partners to help reestablish testing and certification services within Iraq, and a Department of Commerce employee was deployed to help revive the Central Organization for Standardization and Quality Control of Iraq. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style10">V. <em>Litigation</em>: </span>It was, indeed, a busy year in the Lake Wobegon of standards. Several cases rocked the standards community at large, or particular segments of that community. Here is a review of two of the cases that garnered the greatest attention: </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Infineon v. Rambus: </em></strong>Almost everyone was shocked by the upset victory of Rambus over Infineon in its appeal to the Federal Circuit Court in January. Rambus had previously been soundly punished by a Virginia jury, which found its conduct in the JEDEC standard setting process to have been willfully deceptive. That jury awarded substantial damages and attorneys fees to Infineon, an implementer of the JEDEC standards in question. But in January of 2003, a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit Court, which hears all appeals of patent cases, found that the JEDEC process was too vague to be enforceable. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The full court refused to rehear the case, and the Supreme Court also subsequently refused to intervene. In each case, the refusals came notwithstanding the strong support for Infineon given in a number of &quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs filed by multiple parties (including by the author of this story, on behalf multiple SSOs representing thousands of companies, government agencies and universities). The case now returns to the Virginia court for further consideration, consistent with the rulings of the Federal Circuit Court. </p>
              <div align="left"><span class="style2">Rambus also stood trial before an Administrative Judge in 2003, involving an action brought by the Federal Trade Commission based on the same course of conduct. However, the Administrative Judge in that action has given himself several extensions to file his decision. Many observers feel that the judge did not fully absorb the FTC's arguments, and are pessimistic about the decision that is now expected to issue in January or February of 2004. Regardless of the party that the Administrative Judge decides to favor, an appeal to the next level of review within the FTC is almost inevitable. </span>
              </div>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Southern Building Code Congress International v. Veeck:</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit handed down the second legal decision in 2003 that caused a disturbance in the standard setting force. In what has come to be simply referred to as &quot;the Veeck case&quot;, the subject was a Texas building code that referenced a standard. The plaintiff objected to the practical necessity of purchasing a copy of a standard to which he was legally bound to conform, and sought a declaration that the standard must be provided for free. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This seemingly innocuous holding captured the immediate attention of the SDO community. The problem arises from the fact that most accredited standard setting bodies have low membership fees, and derive a significant amount of their operating budgets from the sale of copies of the standards that they create and maintain. Hence, any requirement to give away their standards would force them to adjust their business model. Although the holding in the Veeck case would not impact all standards even if it was applied nation-wide, the potential for another court to further expand the Veeck doctrine placed the case in the limelight. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Following the decision, the defendant SDO sought the intercession of the Supreme Court, which declined to hear an appeal. The holding of the lower court therefore remains binding in the Fifth Circuit - as well as a precedent that courts in other circuits may decide to follow, even if they are not legally bound to do so. As a result of the Supreme Court deciding not to hear the appeal, uncertainty will reign for the indefinite future. As noted in the brief filed by the defending SDO in the case, &quot;Does the government's decision to make the copyrighted proposals binding place the copyrighted material in the public domain? The First Circuit said maybe. The Second and Ninth Circuits said no. And nine of fifteen Fifth Circuit judges said yes.&rdquo; </p>
              <div align="left"><span class="style2">It may or may not have been a coincidence that ISO, the global standards organization, released a trial balloon involving a possible new revenue model for SDOs. Although it was not widely known (and not reported at all in the press), ISO began thinking in mid-Summer about charging for the use of the ubiquitous two letter country codes that it maintains. These codes have become as pervasively used as they are simplistic. Moreover, their initial development hardly required a doctoral decree in computer science. Later in the year, the news leaked out, and the hue and cry over &quot;another threatened tax on the Internet&quot; was great, resulting in the release of several &quot;clarifications&quot; by ISO of its intent. </span>
              </div>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Eolas Technologies v. Microsoft:</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The third case that galvanized not only the standards community but the on-line world at large also involved the prospect of the much-dreaded &quot;tax on the Internet&quot;. One of the truly remarkable things about the World Wide Web is that it has thus far avoided running afoul of blocking (or almost as seriously) royalty-bearing patents directly affecting Web users. Thus it was that when a verdict was handed down in a long running-patent suit involving the technology underlying Web page embedded applets, it was headline news in the technology press. The damages ($521 million) awarded to the one-person company that sued the industry giant -- as well as the implications -- of this verdict caught everyone's attention. In the months that followed, the industry tried to unravel the implications of the decision for vendors and end-users alike. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">While Microsoft marshaled its own response, the W3C leapt into action, seeking the intercession of the Patent and Trademark Office. Not long after, the PTO agreed to review the patent in question to determine whether in fact it should have been issued in the first place. The entire situation exemplified many of the aspects of the current patent system that many in the IT community hate the most -- patents which are often regarded as being too easy too get, but which nonetheless are hugely difficult and expensive to contest. Meanwhile, if the verdict stands, even industry-giant Microsoft will feel the impact of the $512 million award on its legendarily enormous cash balances. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style10"><em>VI. Legislation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></span>2003 brought an unusual level of standards-related legislation in the United States. In March, the Department of Commerce announced an initiative aimed at increasing U.S. exports by harmonizing worldwide product standards, thereby helping break down trade barriers to domestic products. The initiative marked one more realization that going it alone, even for a trade giant like the United States, is not feasible against a global market that remains free to make its own choices, and to form its own alliances. The announcement by Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans included the following observation: &ldquo;Standards and testing are key to our international competitiveness. But more and more we are hearing that foreign standards and testing requirements are keeping our products out of foreign markets.&quot; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">2003 also the adoption by the House of a House Bill 1086 , a piece of legislation that is intended to amend the <em>National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (the NCRPA) </em>in order to give standards development organizations (SDOs) a measure of protection against certain antitrust sanctions. The <em>CSB </em> felt this bill to be well intentioned, but flawed. For example, it could be read to deprive existing consortia of protection even though they were already registered under the Act, because of the restrictive way in which the legislative history of the Bill described qualifying organizations. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Due to the concerns raised by the <em>CSB </em> in its April Issue <em>(&quot;What is Congress Up To? Watch Out for House Bill 1086&quot;) </em> a modest clarification was made to help avoid this conclusion, through the cooperation of ANSI. But still, the amendment would only provide for protection for the SDOs themselves, rather than for their members -- a rather startling drafting decision, given that the NCRPA as it currently exists would give equivalent protection to those same members. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Following passage in the House, the same legislation was introduced in the Senate by Senators Leahy and Hatch in October as Senate Bill 1799 . </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The U.S. Federal Government also exercised influence on standards and their uptake through new rules affecting government purchasing in a number of areas. For example, the N ational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released an initial public draft of <strong>its Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems </strong>in November . The guidelines will form the basis upon which NIST will create a new standard, the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Controls for Federal Information Systems . FIPS 200 will be mandatory for all Federal civilian agencies not involved in national security. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Similarly, the decision by the Department of Defense to follow the lead of merchandising giant Wal-Mart in endorsing and requiring RFID technology is expected to greatly accelerate the adoption of a new standards-based technology (see the preceding story in this issue, &quot;Wireless (Everywhere!)&quot;). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">At the same time, the Federal Government maintained a respectful distance where a private standard setting organization had been responsible for setting standards underlying the power grid -- even to the point of allowing t he North American Electric Reliability Council to assume the power to enforce its heretofore voluntary standards for the electric utility industry, following the massive blackout that stilled major parts of the United States and Canada in August. </p>

As a result of this economic influence, requirements adopted by the government can affect the uptake of standards in the private sector as well (see the &quot;Story Updates&quot; above for another example of this dynamic). On the other hand, one advantage to private sector standards bodies is that they generally can work faster than legislative bodies. Sometimes Congress will take advantage of a voluntary standard created by a consensus process, using it as the basis for a law or regulation. The stories below illustrate each of these phenomena. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style10"><em>VII. Open Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></span>The ups and downs of Linux unquestionably dominated the open source news in 2003. The two main stories that continued to generate new news and interest were the strange quest of SCO to assert the right to levy fees for the use of Linux, due to alleged infringements by IBM, and the continuing exodus of governments around the world from the Microsoft platform in favor of Linux based-systems. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">While coverage of the SCO saga would be beyond the scope of this review of the news, the varied successes of collaborative commercial Linux projects do bear mention. While most people think first of the kind of virtual and voluntary open source project that created Linux, many proprietary vendors are now supporting open source projects as well, representing a new type of standard setting effort that brings together some aspects of consortia as well as major parts of the open source project process. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Commercially funded open source projects of this type had a varied year, with as many foundering or failing as there were others that were achieving their goals. One of the losers in 2003 was United Linux, a four-vendor initiative launched to create and license a business version of Linux. While the initiative attracted great initial success and commercial support, the project began to unravel mid-year, as SCO was one of the four companies involved (the others are TurboLinux, SuSE Linux AG and Connectiva S.A.). By the end of the year, the project was in disarray. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Meanwhile, the Embedded Linux Consortium (launched in March of 2000 in an effort to rally the industry around a single Linux development standard for new embedded products( ) released its ELC Platform Specification in February. On the other hand, the Desktop Linux Consortium, which had announced it was &quot;near launch&quot; in February of 2003 with the objective of &quot;amplify[ing] the depth, breadth and speed of Linux adoption in the enormous desktop computer market&quot; had not announced any major initiatives by year's end, other than a conference held in November in Boston. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">On yet another hand, the Open Software Development Labs (OSDL) had a banner year. OSDL is &quot;dedicated to accelerating the growth and adoption of Linux in the enterprise&quot;, and seeks &quot; to be the recognized center of gravity for Linux; the central body dedicated to accelerating the use of Linux for enterprise computing.&quot; It achieved a major coup by persuading Li nux creator Linus Torvalds to join its staff in June as an &quot;OSDL Fellow&quot;. More good news came in the form of adding major new industry players to its highly priced membership, including Novell and Sun. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Other commercial open source projects made major releases as well, with the Mozilla Foundation announcing the release of Version 1.5 of its multifunction Internet application suite, and the March announcement by Sun's OpenOffice.org project of its version 1.1. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Business, of course, was still business, and Sun gave IBM-affiliated open source project Eclipse.org a snub late in the year, when it announced that it would not become a member. Earlier, there had been much public speculation in the technical press Sun might come aboard, notwithstanding the competition represented by its own NetBeans project. In December, Eclipse.org announced that it would achieve independence from IBM, which has reportedly poured more than $40 million into the project. When that process is complete, perhaps Sun may reconsider. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, in December, a new initiative was announced by a group including all of the major Linux developers worldwide, with the objective of providing &quot;data center backup support across a broad array of applications.&quot; Next year will tell whether this new initiative ends up in the winners or the loser's column. </p>

How big a step? Big enough that the open source organization hopes to convince IBM arch-rival Sun Microsystems (which promotes NetBeans, its own open source tool initiative) to join the party, and help stabilize the Java community by building a path of interoperability between the Eclipse and the NetBeans code.

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>VIII. Rest in Peace:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Beginnings of brave new initiatives are (usually) more interesting than their endings, but 2003, like any other year, saw its share of endpoints that also bear notice. While the announcement of a new standard setting consortium is one of the few events that such an organization can count on to get some measure of press attention, an organization's dissolution is something that its members' would usually prefer would escape notice. Here are two of the consortia whose passage into that dark good night did not escape the eye of a watchful press. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The formation of the first, curiously enough, was occasioned by the Rambus suit (see &quot;Litigation&quot;, above). The <strong><em>Advanced DRAM Consortium </em></strong> was created in January of 2000 by DRAM heavyweights such as Intel, Samsung, Infineon and NEC, as an alternative to the JEDEC process that had hosted the standard setting effort that gave birth to the Rambus litigation. After three years, the ADC founders decided that the JEDEC process was fine, after all. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The second consortium, the <strong><em>HomeRF Working Group </em></strong> also forms a counterpoint to a story in this <em>issue (see &quot;Wireless (Everywhere!)&quot;, above) </em>. With Wi-Fi garnering by far the greatest news coverage today, and Bluetooth fading fast, few recall that there were other contenders in the short-range wireless standards race, or that standard called &quot;HomeRF&quot; was at one time considered to be a front-runner. HomeRF was conceived to carry voice as well as data, and at one time its members (at least) thought that it would be the first standard to be commercially implemented. But when Intel decided to back the Wi-Fi horse instead, the HomeRF Working Group's days were numbered. In January of this year, a member confirmed to a CNET reporter that the group had, to paraphrase Monty Python's John Cleese in the immortal &quot;Dead Parrot&quot; vignette, shuffled off its mortal coil, and joined the Consortium Chorus Indivisible. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="unnamed1"><em>#8 </em>December 1, 2003 - </span>For all of this year, we have been reporting on the rapid developments occurring in the area of RFID (or Radio Frequency Identification) tags. While some analysts are saying &quot;too soon&quot; to prospective customers, others are noting that standards are key to lowering early-deployment risk. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">For those who have not been tracking this area, RFID is a new standards-based wireless technology that enables tiny chips to be affixed to almost anything, to permit the item to be tracked. The potential for the technology has been trumpeted for everything from Homeland Security applications to concert tickets, but is most obviously suited for wide-scale adoption in the supply chain. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But while new technologies (some involve batteries printed as ink on film) and volume production may ultimately permit per-tag prices to drop to five cents a piece (or even a penny), the ROI on installing the necessary infrastructure to deploy an RFID system may still not be obvious in most circumstances. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">All of that may change, however, as there are some major drivers behind the adoption of this technology that are rarely present in most early-adoption commercial situations. As we have previously reported, both Wal-Mart, and now the Department of Defense have announced that they will require vendors to adopt RFID technology, which will have a dramatic impact on driving down RFID unit prices. But the more expensive elements of RFID-based systems will be evolving rapidly for some time, thus offering the risk for early obsolescence for early adopter/purchasers of such systems. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">What to do, if you're a defense contractor or a major supplier to Wal-Mart? One analyst identifies the following as a key element of any early-adopter deployment strategy:</p>
              <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Invest in open standards, such as XML, as much as possible. If a company ties an RFID system to proprietary software processes, it will be locked into out-of-date technology almost as soon as its deployment is complete. An RFID project is an excellent opportunity to revamp proprietary systems and invest in open standards . [RFID: An ROI Black Hole, Barry Mason, Nucleus Research] </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Once again, standards lower risk. </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">During 2003, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), has been exploring ways that it can serve the consortium community, as well as the Standards Development Organizations that it accredits. In May of 2003, ANSI announced that its National Policy Committee (NPC) had established &quot;an ad hoc group to focus on the relationship of ANSI with fora and consortia&quot;, and noting that &quot;One of the objectives set forth in the National Standards Strategy is to '[b]roaden the U.S. standards &lsquo;umbrella' to include all those organizations that are contributing to the standards system.'&rdquo; The ad hoc group was charged with considering &quot;what actions ANSI could take, relative to unaccredited standards developers, that would improve coordination and collaboration for ANSI and its members, while improving the national and international standards infrastructure overall.&quot; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">We were pleased to be contacted by the Ad Hoc Group, and to be asked to offer our thoughts on how ANSI and the consortium community could work together most effectively. One result of the Ad Hoc Group's efforts was the creation of a survey, which all consortia are being welcomed to complete. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The following is the text of the ANSI announcement, and includes instructions on how to find and access the survey. We applaud this effort and hope that as many eligible readers of the <strong><em>CSB </em></strong> as possible will take the small amount of time needed to complete the survey. </p>

                </span><br>
  New York&nbsp; January 5, 2004 </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The National Policy Committee (NPC) of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has announced that it is conducting a survey to identify ways in which ANSI and consortia can work together for the benefit of standards developers and the stakeholders they wish to serve. The survey has been issued to companies, individuals, and organizations involved in consortium-based standards development. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">According to Stephen Oksala, chairman of the NPC, &ldquo;This strengthened collaboration will be a positive step for organizations within the U.S. and around the globe.&rdquo; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The survey is consistent with one of the goals identified within the National Standards Strategy for the United States (NSS) (www.ansi.org/nss). The NSS establishes a standardization framework based upon a set of strategic and tactical initiatives that can be used by all interests to meet national and individual organizational objectives. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">&ldquo;ANSI welcomes the opportunity to partner with standards setting organizations in all sectors,&rdquo; said Anne Caldas, director of the ANSI procedures and administration department. Responses received are expected to provide a better understanding of the needs of the many and varied organizations involved in standardization. Aggregated replies will be compiled and presented in a summary format during 2004. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Any interested party may obtain the survey via ANSI Online at <a href="http://www.ansi.org" target="_off">www.ansi.org </a> (keyword search &quot;survey&quot;). Responses will be accepted between January 1 and January 31, 2004, and should be returned via e-mail to <a href="mailto:psa@ansi.org">psa@ansi.org</a>. </p>
