                  <p align="center" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">For better or worse,  intellectual property rights (IPR), and particularly patent claims, are part of  the very atmosphere that standards developers must breath as they practice  their craft.&nbsp; As a result, I write about  them frequently, not only in this journal, but in every other section of this  site as well.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This focus arises not only  from the fact that IPR impacting IPR cannot be avoided in standard setting, but  also because so many things change so frequently in the standard setting environment  that affect IPR.&nbsp; Given the economic  importance of IPR, there is always a lot to think and write about in this  area.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In this issue, I will  examine IPR issues from both ends of the telescope.&nbsp; For the benefit of those that are not already acquainted with the  intricacies of IPR, I'll provide a high-level overview of what they are all  about in the context of standard setting.&nbsp;  And for those that are already well versed in this subject area, I'll  focus on some of the IPR stories that are currently in the news.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In this month's <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>,  I review and commend the recent efforts by VITA and the IEEE, two standard  setting organizations that have elected to boldly go where few of their peers  have as (as yet) traveled.&nbsp; Each has  taken the difficult, time-consuming, and even traumatic step of revising its  IPR policy to permit (in the case of IEEE) and require (in the case of VITA)  its members to disclose the licensing terms they would require to implement  their necessary claims in a draft standard, if adopted.&nbsp; This type of &quot;<em>ex ante&quot;</em> disclosure raises legal and other concerns that give pause to many, but the  practice could also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the standard  setting process as well.&nbsp; In so doing,  these pioneers are providing a service to all other standard setting  organizations that may choose to follow their lead in the future.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong>,  I provide a comprehensive overview of the role of IPR in standard setting,  providing a historical introduction, a description of the rights themselves,  and an overview of the policies and procedures standard setting organizations  have evolved to address them.&nbsp; This is  the latest in a series of overview articles I have written that are intended,  when taken together, to help anyone to become well-grounded in the essentials  of standard setting.&nbsp; Each time I  publish one of these articles in the CSB, I also add it to the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/essentialguide/">Essential Guide to  Standard Setting Organizations and Standards</a>.&nbsp; At some point in the future, I may make these articles available  as a book, to provide a reference in hard copy form for that elect, or are  required, to participate in standard setting activities.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection for this month, I report on a recent IPR-based court decision  involving two industry giants (QUALCOMM, Incorporated and Broadcom  Corporation), and on allegations by the latter that the former engaged in the  same type of abuse of the standard setting process that Rambus, Inc. was  convicted of practicing (last week, a federal judge agreed).</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In an <strong><em>Update</em></strong>,  I describe what's new with Rambus itself.&nbsp;  Two weeks ago, the Federal Trade Commission granted the semiconductor  technology company a partial stay of the penalties the FTC had imposed upon  Rambus in February, pending the hearing of its appeal.&nbsp; Under the FTC's decision, however, Rambus  may only have access to the amount of royalties allowed under the penalty order  &ndash; the balance must be paid by implementers into an escrow account.&nbsp; If Rambus is successful in its appeal, it  will receive those funds.&nbsp; If it loses,  they will be returned to the manufacturers that paid them.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">And finally, in this month's <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong>, I explore the dire and deleterious impact that <em>de  facto</em> standards can sometimes have on the user experience, using that most  feared and loathed of all garments &ndash; the medical jammy &ndash; as an example.</p>
                  <div align="left" class="style2">As  always, I hope you enjoy this issue.&nbsp;</div>

                  <br>
                  SALUTE TO VITA AND IEEE
</strong></p>
              <p align="center" class="style10"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></strong></font></p>
              <p align="center" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Standard  setting and innovation enjoy an interesting symbiotic relationship.&nbsp; Without innovation, the need for new  standards would decrease, and eventually dry up completely.&nbsp; And without standards, many types of  innovation would struggle in the marketplace, and many would fail.&nbsp; As the world becomes more virtual and less  physical, the new products and services that are the fruits of technical  innovation will become even more dependent upon standards.&nbsp; The hundreds of consortia that have sprung  up in the last twenty years bear ample witness to this trend.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Standard  setting itself has not traditionally been distinguished by rapid innovation,  however.&nbsp; This may be so in part because  in the past, standards have more often followed, rather than led or been  developed in parallel with the technologies that they serve.&nbsp; Again, while product innovation can be  driven by a single individual with a vision, standards by definition are the  product of consensus, often achieved with considerable difficulty among those  with quite divergent interests.&nbsp; Too,  standards must be highly credible to become widely deployed.&nbsp; Each of these dynamics lends itself to  conservatism rather than risk taking in the breach.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Of  course, innovation is not wholly unknown in standard setting.&nbsp; The concept of launching consortia in  competition with accredited standard setting organizations seemed radical, and  even dangerous, to some when the floodgates of this type of activity were first  opened.&nbsp; Today, of course, there are  many well-respected consortia that are nearly indistinguishable from their  accredited peers in width and breadth of activity, and in the wide adoption of  their standards output.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Still,  consensus-based processes have much to gain when they become recognized as  institutions.&nbsp; Those that achieve that  status are likely to become enamored of the respect and credibility that  institutions enjoy.&nbsp; As a result,  change, even in the service of innovation, can seem to be more threatening than  desirable.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">A  natural hesitation to embrace change can be found in many that participate in  standard setting as well.&nbsp; Standard  setting is, after all, a political process.&nbsp;  Like all political processes, achieving the outcome that a participant  desires depends upon how well that participant understands the rules and the  system, and whether it can use those tools to best advantage.&nbsp; For those on the offense, a stable system  therefore offers an excellent opportunity to refine skills and benefit from  that prowess.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">For  those on the defense, predictability offers a sense of safety.&nbsp; Predictability is also more easily discerned  in stable systems, where the same rules are applied to similar situations.&nbsp; All things being equal, and so long as the  rules do not change, a member's competitors are more likely to act, vote and  bargain in the future as they have in the past.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The same  comfort factor applies to legal risks.&nbsp;  Experience has demonstrated that participation in standard setting is  not a high risk activity, despite the fact that it involves bringing many  competitors into the same room to agree upon common action &ndash; ordinarily, the  very stuff of which antitrust investigations are based upon.&nbsp; Operating beyond parameters that have proven  to be safe in the past can make change appear threatening indeed, especially if  understanding the bounds of safety might seem to require the advice of a legal  expert.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">For all  of these reasons, there has always been great inertia in standard setting.&nbsp; That inertia can make innovation appear to  represent purely risk, and offer no potential for reward.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But  surrendering to inertia can have its risks as well, although this type of risk  may be less obvious.&nbsp; For example,  inertia can lead to a gradual loss of efficiency in the standard setting  process, higher costs of standards development, a decrease in the  market-appropriateness of the standards that are produced, or even a higher  failure rate of standards to become widely adopted.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Currently,  standard setting is experiencing a sort of innovation challenge, as many  participants in the standard setting process are concluding that some elements  of traditional intellectual property rights (IPR) policies are proving  inadequate to address the realities of the marketplace as it is evolving  today.&nbsp; While some changes that are  being advocated today are relatively minor and evolutionary, others are more  dramatic, and may appear to be revolutionary to some.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">One such  change involves the so-called &quot;ex ante&quot; disclosure of licensing  terms, perhaps even including the prices that a patent owner might demand as a  precondition to implementing a given standard.&nbsp;  Permitting, or even requiring, such disclosures would seem to require  conduct that standards participants have been sternly warned by lawyers to  avoid throughout their careers.&nbsp;  Moreover, such a practice would dramatically change many other dynamics  in the consensus-based process, requiring the development by each member of new  strategies and skills.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As a  result, those that do not individually feel the need for change are likely to  feel threatened, or even hostile, to proposals to amend existing policies to  embrace <em>ex ante</em> disclosure.&nbsp;  These reactions can render the introduction of changes within a  consensus-based organization difficult indeed.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Recently,  two well-respected, accredited standards development organizations  headquartered in the United States have moved in the direction of ex ante, one  conservatively, and one dramatically.&nbsp;  The first is the IEEE, which is changing its IPR policy to permit <em>ex  ante</em> disclosure, and the other is VITA, which has gone much further, and  voted to put in place a policy that will require it.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The actions  of these two organizations, I believe, are to be greatly applauded.&nbsp; Each has gone to great time, trouble, and  expense to move these significant process changes through their internal  procedures.&nbsp; In doing so, they are  performing a significant service to the standard setting community as a  whole.&nbsp; This is because each  organization has served as a crucible within which the benefits, risks and  impacts of such a change have been debated, modified and ultimately approved,  providing real-world examples that other organizations interested in making  similar changes can use as efficient starting points for their own efforts.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">And also because each organization has gone to the time and expense of
asking their attorneys to file a detailed request with the United States
Department of Justice for a "business review letter."  These requests, as
well as the DOJ's responses, are public documents.  In each case, the
organization's proposed process has been described in detail, and in each
case the DOJ has commented upon, and then expressed approval, of those
processes.  While these letters are unique to their situation and cannot be
legally relied upon by other organizations, they provide valuable
information on how the regulators view specific instances of ex ante
implementation.  When they are read in conjunction with earlier policy
statements from both the FTC and the US Department of Justice, they provide
a growing body of guidance, and an expanding comfort zone, for other
organizations to exploit.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">A  similar service will also be provided by these organizations when their amended  policies are reviewed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for  compliance with that organization's accreditation requirements.&nbsp; When both policies have been approved as proposed,  or as supplemented or changed at the request of ANSI, this also will provide  guidance for accredited organizations, each of which will benefit from the  willingness of VITA and IEEE to act as pioneers. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In  summary, I believe that the standard setting community at large owes a vote of  thanks to these two organizations for having the initiative and the  determination to innovate.&nbsp; Inertia is a  seductive force, and neither of these organizations faced an urgent crisis that  demanded action.&nbsp; Because they were  willing to tackle a tough task, other organizations will find it easier to do  so.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Sometimes,  standard setting demands innovation as urgently as do the industries that  standard setting serves.&nbsp; And, just as  in those industries, innovation demands leadership.&nbsp; Hats off to VITA and IEEE for providing must that.</p>

                <p align="center" class="style10"><strong> IN A "SON OF RAMBUS" SUIT
                </strong></p>
                <div align="left" class="style56"><strong>Friday, March 23 2007 </strong></div>
                <span class="style2">Views: 901 </span>
                <p class="style2"> A Federal Court sitting in San Diego, California has upheld a jury's unanimous verdict that QUALCOMM Incorporated abused the standards process by failing to make timely patent disclosures during the process of developing a technical standard.  The litigation arose when Qualcomm filed suit against arch-enemy Broadcom Corporation, an implementer of the standard.  The decision follows on the heels of a unanimous verdict by the Federal Trade Commission against memory technology company Rambus, inc. under similar factual circumstances.</p>
                <p class="style2">Cases involving standards abuse are infrequent, but Qualcomm and  Broadcom are currently involved in as many separate pieces of standards-related  litigation as the entire industry usually indulges in over a period of  years.&nbsp;In one suit (in which I helped draft and file a friend of the court  brief on behalf of several standards organizations), Broadcom alleges that  Qualcomm refused to honor its pledge to license its &quot;essential  claims&quot; under a standard on &quot;reasonable and nondiscriminatory  terms.&quot;&nbsp;Other suits are continuing in multiple courts in several countries,  including an antitrust suit that Broadcom lost &ndash;<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060902204840119&">but perhaps not permanently</a> &ndash;  before the FTC issued it's verdict in Rambus. Ironically, the flurry of legal  action is helping develop judicial guidelines for standards development and  licensing on a more rapid basis than usual.</p>
                <p class="style2">The current case was brought by Qualcomm  in October 2005, and involved two patents that it later alleged would be  infringed by implementing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264">H.264</a>, a video compression  standard developed by the Joint Video Team (JVT), an effort supported by two  global standard setting bodies, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T" title="ITU-T">ITU-T</a>, acting through  its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCEG" title="VCEG">Video Coding Experts Group</a> (VCEG)and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission" title="International Electrotechnical Commission">IEC</a>, acting through its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_Picture_Experts_Group" title="Moving Picture Experts Group">Moving  Picture Experts Group</a> (MPEG).&nbsp;The jury concluded that  implementing the H/264standard would not result in infringement, but also  indicated that it believed that Qualcomm had acted improperly before the United  States Patent Office (USPTO) in obtaining the patents in question.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  In affirming the jury's verdict, the federal judge found that  Qualcomm's behavior was equivalent to that of Rambus, Inc., as determined by  the FTC:&nbsp;</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"> Qualcomm waived its rights to enforce the&hellip;patents against H.264  products by its silence in the face of a &quot;clear duty to speak&quot; to  identify to the JVT its IPR related to the development of the H.264  standard&hellip;.The non-disclosure of a participant's core patents in such a program  could put the participant in a position in which it could literally block the  use of the published H.264 standard by any company unless the company obtained  a separate license from the participant.&nbsp;Such an undesirable consequence  is likely one factor behind the basis for the Federal Circuit ruling in Rambus,  which the Court applies in this case.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  But unlike the FTC, which recently decided to limit, rather than  eliminate, Rambus's right to charge royalties to implementers of the SDRAM  standards there at issue, the Qualcomm court has apparently decided to apply  the penalty levied by the FTC in its prosecution of Dell computer, a decade ago  &ndash; and bar Qualcomm from enforcing the patents against implementers at all.</p>
                <p class="style2">Broadcom, not surprisingly, is taking the verdict well.&nbsp;In a <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=977165">press release</a> issued earlier today  titled &quot;Federal Court Rules that Qualcomm Abused Industry Standard  Process,&quot; David A. Dull (unfortunate name, that), its Senior Vice  President and General counsel, stated:&nbsp;</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"> We are pleased that the court agreed with the jury's  recommendation on standards abuse and believe the evidence that came to light  in this case is illustrative of Qualcomm's ongoing abuse of the rules of  industry standards bodies.&nbsp;It confirms what the industry has long  suspected: that Qualcomm does not shoot straight with standards bodies. We are  continuing to examine their conduct before various cellular and other standards  bodies.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">&nbsp;Qualcomm, naturally, sees it a bit differently, especially  for purposes of its own <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/press/releases/2007/070322_federal_judge_rules.html">press  release</a>.&nbsp;Instead of focusing on the part of the opinion that held it  had failed to disclose its patents, it directed the reader's attention to the  fact that the USPTO decided that Qualcomm had not failed to disclose important  &quot;prior art&quot; as required, when applying for the patents in  question.&nbsp;As a result, while Qualcomm may not be able to assert the  patents against implementers of the H. 264 standard, the patents themselves  will stand, and can be used to economic advantage in other applications.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style2">The press release in which Qualcomm made this point bears the  following rather lengthy title:&nbsp;&quot;Federal Judge Rules QUALCOMM&rsquo;s  Conduct before U.S. Patent Office Lawful But Finds QUALCOMM Did Not Meet  Unwritten IPR Disclosure Expectations of Standard Setting  Group.&quot;&nbsp;That press release begins:&nbsp;</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"> A federal judge ruled today that &ldquo;despite the jury's advisory  verdict to the contrary, the Court finds no clear and convincing evidence of  inequitable conduct&rdquo; by QUALCOMM Incorporated&hellip;in obtaining two patents. &hellip;A 2005  suit filed by QUALCOMM in San Diego federal court accused Broadcom's video  encoding chips of infringing the patents. At a trial in January 2007, Broadcom  argued that QUALCOMM had deceived the Patent Office by withholding certain  alleged prior art in order to obtain the patents. In today's ruling, Judge Rudi  M. Brewster flatly disagreed, finding that QUALCOMM had disclosed the most  relevant prior art to the patent office and that QUALCOMM was not guilty of any  conduct before the Patent Office that would render the patents unenforceable.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  The release goes on to more delicately admit that the judge also  ruled that Qualcomm's patent disclosure &quot;was not timely,&quot; and that  disclosure, in any event was mandated only by:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">&hellip;the unwritten expectations of the group's  members&hellip;.Notably, the court did not find that QUALCOMM had violated any  provision of the JVT's written intellectual property policy, but rather that a  duty to make an earlier disclosure arose from his conclusion that the JVT  members considered themselves obligated to make IPR declarations in  circumstances not mandated by the written IPR policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  Qualcomm's own general counsel, Lou Lupin, was &quot;gratified&quot;  by the finding on the USPTO issues, but less happy about the disclosure ruling,  stating: </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"> We are very troubled, however, by the  judge's finding that an obligation to make IPR declarations may arise in the  standard setting environment from members' 'understandings' not expressed in  the standard setting organization's written IPR policy. Such a rule would leave  companies whose businesses require them to participate in standardization  efforts in the untenable position of having to guess what their disclosure  obligations might be. We respectfully disagree with the court's reasoning that  strict compliance with a standards body's written IPR policy is not enough. We  also believe that, even if such an unwritten obligation could arise when the  standards body members all considered themselves to be so obligated, all  evidence here was that the JVT participants did not.&nbsp;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  The court will reconvene on May 2, 2007 to consider the issue of  damages, at which point, one assumes, further dueling press releases may be  anticipated.</p>

Views: 452 </p>
                <p class="style2">Memory technology developer  Rambus, Inc. secured an important, but not unexpected tactical victory on  Friday, when the Federal Trade Commission released an order partially staying  the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070207033528152">sanctions  that it imposed</a> on February 2, 2007.&nbsp;In the earlier order, the FTC  prohibited Rambus from charging royalties in excess of those the Commissioners  determined Rambus could have charged to implement two standards, absent its  abuse of the standards process that created those standards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under  the new order, Rambus will be permitted to continue to charge the rates it demanded  prior to the FTC's intervention &ndash; but only if it causes the excess amounts to  be paid by its licensees into a court-approved escrow account.&nbsp;The order  is conditional, and will not become effective, unless Rambus files its  anticipated appeal of the original decision in a Court of Appeals prior to  April 12, the effective date of the February 2 decision.</p>
                <p class="style2">The Commissioners' latest  Order will be welcomed by Rambus' stockholders, because Rambus would otherwise  have been required to either drop its rates on April 12, or seek to renegotiate  all of its licenses in such a way as to require make-up payments from its  licensees, should it ultimately succeed on appeal.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style2">But  the new Order will not be good news for Rambus licensees, which will be  deprived of the near-term use of funds that the FTC had already held to be  excessive, and illegally obtained.&nbsp;Those funds may eventually be returned  to them &ndash; with interest, but minus the fees of the escrow agent &ndash; if Rambus  loses its appeal at some yet to be determined point in the future.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Friday's Order denied  Rambus's plea to stay the other terms of the Commission's original ruling,  because (as noted in a footnote to last Friday's decision) Rambus did not  &quot;articulate any reasons for staying&quot; these provisions.&nbsp;That  Rambus would have failed to do so is not surprising, given that these other  provisions bar Rambus from misrepresenting or failing to disclose its patents  in standard setting organizations (e.g., in so many words, &quot;thou shalt not  cheat&quot;).</p>
                <p class="style2">While the Commissioners  called their decision &quot;a difficult one&quot; in the Conclusion of the  Order, in fact the partial stay was not contested by the FTC's own Complaint  Counsel, presumably because he believed the relief sought by Rambus to be  reasonable under the FTC's own Rules of Practice and Procedure (16 C.F.R.  Section 3.56(c)).&nbsp;Under those rules, the party asking for relief must  address the following four factors:</p>
                <p class="style2">1.&nbsp;The likelihood that  the applicant will succeed on appeal</p>
                <p class="style2">2.&nbsp;That it would suffer  &quot;irreparable harm&quot; if the stay is not granted</p>
                <p class="style2">3.&nbsp;The degree of injury  that other parties would suffer if the stay is granted</p>
                <p class="style2">4.&nbsp;Why the stay is in  the public interest</p>
                <p class="style2">As it happens, the first  factor is rather easily addressed, given that there is precedent that the mere  fact that a &quot;complex factual record&quot; is involved is sufficient to  give rise to a chance that another court may come out differently.</p>
                <p class="style2">The second factor is most  obvious, given the possibility that Rambus might not find itself able to  recover the excess funds by any other means.</p>
                <p class="style2">The third factor is  addressed by the escrow arrangement, which the FTC will review, and which the  Commissioners describe at length in the order in an effort to ensure that the  impact on licensees (other than the interim loss of use of their funds) will be  as gentle as possible.&nbsp;Moreover, the Commissioners note that the damage to  licensees will not be irreparable if Rambus loses its appeal, while the damage  to Rambus might well be, if its appeal succeeds.</p>
                <p class="style2">The Commissioners do not  address the last &quot;prong&quot; of the test convincingly, or  directly.&nbsp;Unlike the first two factors, which are addressed specifically,  the Order discusses the last two tests together, balancing the relative harm to  Rambus of one outcome, and to the public of the other.&nbsp;That analysis  primarily addresses factor 3 &ndash; which addresses the negative impacts, but not  factor 4 &ndash; which is concerned with the positive effects (e.g., not whether harm  will result, but whether a positive result will obtain).&nbsp;The closest that  the Order comes to addressing the fourth test head on is this simple statement:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2">&hellip;we  note that a blanket stay of the provisions prohibiting Rambus from collecting  excess royalties would frustrate the Commission's efforts to restore  competition to the relevant markets.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">The Order also includes a  further point of significance to the marketplace: a clarification (to the  extent that any clarification was in fact necessary) that the Commissioners'  February 2 order was intended to impose only a&nbsp;&quot;forward-looking remedy.&quot;&nbsp;Rambus  had rather implausibly asked for a total stay of the economic sanctions of the  original Order, contending that it was unclear whether it might have to  disgorge past royalties in excess of those now permitted.&nbsp;Not  surprisingly, the Commissioners opted to clarify their intention instead.</p>
                <p class="style2">While an appeals court will  determine whether the Commissioners' February 2 Order stands or falls, the FTC  will retain authority over the escrowed funds, and will oversee their  distribution in one direction or the other, upon delivery of a final  &quot;mandate&quot; by the appellate court.</p>
                <p class="style2">Action will now turn, then,  to an entirely new venue: the Court of Appeals in which Rambus brings its  appeal.&nbsp;At that point, the seemingly endless merry-go-round of the Rambus  saga will begin once again &ndash; more than a decade and a half after the occurrence  of the events that gave rise to this never ending standards drama.&nbsp;</p>
                <blockquote>

                <p align="left" class="style56"> <strong> [][][] <strong> March 31, 2007</strong> </strong></p>
                <p><span class="style56"><em>#47</em></span><strong class="style38"><em> Standards and Innovation (and Standards Degradation)  </em></strong></p>
                <p class="style2">One canard that is occasionally  thrown out by a vendor in a corner is that &quot;standards stifle  innovation.&quot;&nbsp; In fact, of course,  nothing could be farther from the truth, because when vendors agree upon a  standard at an appropriate level of detail, they help create a larger  market.&nbsp; This increases the profit  opportunity, and provides a growing incentive for more vendors to enter that  market.&nbsp; Since all products must be  identical at the level of the standard, vendors can only compete by adding additional  desirable features, improving quality, and competing on price.&nbsp; The result is what is often referred to as a  &quot;virtuous circle&quot; of incentives and results.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">If that sounds like  standards spin, consider your car, which implements thousands of standards,  covering virtually every one of its parts, from the tires to the radio.&nbsp; And yet competition is relentless to upgrade  the basic product (&quot;car&quot;) by adding new features, and improving old  ones, despite the fact that profit margins on most cars are quite slim.</p>
                <p class="style2">The reality is that the  great majority of standards help create meaningful choices, rather than limit  them.&nbsp; True, some standards can restrict  choice, and sometimes even in an arbitrary fashion, due to practical or  economic reasons.&nbsp; But then again,  you've probably never been heartbroken over your inability to buy a 42 watt  light bulb.</p>
                <p class="style2">No, the problem isn't  standards imposed by consensus agreement among those that implement them, but <em>de  facto</em> standards imposed by single product or service providers that  accumulated the market power to mandate them.&nbsp;  When the customer has no choice but to buy, then the vendor or service  provider has little incentive to offer the customer any more than the bare  minimum it takes to cause a potential customer to part with the her cash.&nbsp; Or, as Henry Ford once famously observed  when the only reliable, affordable car you could by was his Model T, &quot;You  can have any color you want, as long as it's black.&quot;&nbsp; Not long after, when competition increased,  every manufacturer &ndash; including Ford &ndash; offered multiple color choices.</p>
                <p class="style2">In most cases, <em>de facto</em> standards &ndash; like the Model T &ndash; eventually lose out.&nbsp; Either competitors meet or beat the price, or the patents expire,  or a better technology or idea enters the marketplace.&nbsp; <em>De facto</em> standards that do achieve  relative immortality tend to be arbitrary (e.g., the 24 hour day, and weights  and measures) or utilitarian, with no commercial advantage to be gained by  superseding them with anything different (like the dimensions of light  sockets).&nbsp; But even in such cases, the  standard must be doing a pretty good job, or even it will eventually be  replaced, notwithstanding the huge inertia that may lie behind it.</p>
                <p class="style2">As a result, it takes highly  unusual circumstances for a really, really crummy standard to come into being  and persist.&nbsp; But it does happen, and I  expect you already know what the absolute worst, most inexcusable, most  unconscionable most despicable example of design negligence is.</p>
                <p class="style2">Can't think what it is?&nbsp; Well then, Consider this:</p>
                <p class="style2">I speak, of course, of that  most detested excuse for a garment, the hospital &quot;jammy.&quot;</p>
                <p class="style2">Anyone that has ever had a  physical exam, or spent time in a hospital, has become intimately acquainted  with this miserable scrap of fabric, which for reasons unknown is identical and  uniform in every examination room, clinic and hospital in the United  States.&nbsp; In short, a standard, or more  accurately, a standard implementation of a standard.&nbsp; And both the standard itself, as well as its implementation, are  examples of what can only be regarded as standards and implementation  malpractice, respectively.</p>
                <p class="style2">Or, perhaps, as standards  degradation.&nbsp; Perhaps, once upon a time,  jammies walked the earth (or lay on shelves; whatever) that actually did a  competent job.&nbsp; If so, both the standard  as well as the implementation certainly degraded over time.&nbsp; Through lack of competition and innovation,  the jammy eventually deteriorated into the sartorial equivalent of the  appendix, offering little obvious benefit, but significant potential for unhappiness.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">How could this occur?&nbsp; The answer can be instructive, as it  demonstrates why consensus based standards work, and why proprietary, <em>de  facto</em> ones usually don't.</p>
                <p class="style2">Let's find out by performing  a simple exercise, and develop an appropriate standard that we'll call <strong><em>People  Friendly Jammy 1.0 (PFJ 1.0)</em></strong>.&nbsp;  As we all know, a consensus standard should be created through the  input, and meet the needs, of all relevant stakeholders (i.e., those that will  benefit from, or be affected by, the final standard).&nbsp; So of course we'll start by stating the requirements the standard  should meet from the perspective of the two principle stakeholder groups that  will need to interact with implementations of PFJ 1.0: the service provider,  and the customer.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Service provider concerns:</em></strong>&nbsp; &quot;One size fits all;&quot; inexpensive;  easily cleaned; able to render the subject (you) readily accessible for visual  and instrumental examination, probing and other indignities.</p>
                  <p class="style2"><strong><em>Customer concerns:</em></strong>&nbsp; Easy to understand and put on; warm; capable  of covering total body surface area when portion of same is not needed for  examination, probing, etc.; capable of preserving human dignity, as compared to  rendering the subject ridiculous; capable of providing comfort under stressful  conditions; capable of reducing feelings of vulnerability and isolation in an  alien environment.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">Now let's do a sanity  check:&nbsp; do we see any mutually exclusive  requirements above?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; I don't, either.&nbsp; So we're good to go!</p>
                <p class="style2">With this much accomplished,  we should now be able to come up with the specific design elements of PFJ  1.0.&nbsp; Just for fun, though, we'll see  how the existing market implementations of the <strong><em>Jammy Piece of Crap 1.0  (JPC 1.0)</em></strong> standard with which we are all, all too familiar.&nbsp; To make the effort appropriately scientific,  we&rsquo;ll also score the success of that element to meet the requirements of the  service provider, on the one hand, and the customer on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scoring is 1 &ndash; 10 (with 10 being  highest).&nbsp; Finally, we'll underline and  place in italics those elements of each standard that can actually be found in  current market examples of examination room jammies.&nbsp; Those that have evidently not made their way into the <em>de facto</em> market standard will be found in plain text.</p>
                <p class="style2">I think we're all ready,  except to give our little thought experiment an appropriate title, which will  be:</p>

                <p class="style2">2.&nbsp; A standard can be flexible, as long as there is competition.&nbsp; Note that the standard above does not <em>require</em> that the customer gets the shaft, although it does <em>permit</em> it.&nbsp; If a patient knew that one hospital had a  jammy that met her needs, she would at least express displeasure when she was  handed the traditional offensive model by a competing service provider.</p>
                <p class="style2">3.&nbsp; In the absence of choice, there is no incentive to honor the  needs of the customer at all.&nbsp; Medical  facilities and service providers do compete fiercely at other levels, and do  innovate and compete on price at those levels, in order to steer customers  their way.&nbsp; But once the mouse is in the  trap, the urge to please plummets.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">4.&nbsp; Lock in (by insurance provider, or through the physician that  makes the referral or recommends the facility) is powerful.</p>
                <p class="style2">5.&nbsp; There is no correlation overall, and indeed rarely even as to any  individual element, between a high score for the service provider and a low  score for the customer.&nbsp; What is most  evident is negligence and disregard for the customer, rather than sacrificing a  desired benefit for a customer in order to satisfy a particular need of the  service provider. </p>
                <p class="style2">What our little exercise  demonstrates most dramatically is not that the control of a <em>de facto</em> standard will not automatically <em>cause</em> a vendor or service provider to  consciously take advantage of its customers, but that it will <em>allow</em> it  to become totally indifferent to its customers opinions and needs.&nbsp; Either way, the vendor-customer relationship  has become totally one-sided, with the customer receiving only what the vendor  or service provider chooses to offer.&nbsp;  The vendor can take advantage of the power relationship that it enjoys  at any time, even to the point of abusing its customer.</p>
                <p class="style2">Right now, regular readers  might be asking themselves if there is not in fact another product in the  marketplace that I might be thinking of that represents an even more egregious  and pernicious example of how a vendor can exploit a <em>de facto</em> standard  to the detriment of its customer.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">Well, you're right.&nbsp; I bet you can guess what that product is,  too, but just in case, I'll tell you any way.</p>
                <p class="style2">So here it is:&nbsp; Have you ever had to wear one of those blue  paper, <em>disposable</em> jammies, with the squared off corners, that make you  look like a Jack of Hearts in a pixie uniform wearing an apron?&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">No?&nbsp; Well, don't get me started&hellip;.</p>
