                  <p align="left" class="style2">With hundreds of information  and communications technology (ICT) standard setting organizations (SSO) to  choose from, how do you decide which one to join?</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">That's an easier question to  ask than to answer, and tends to lead to more questions.&nbsp; SSOs, like any other organization, vary in ability  to get the job done in an effective, efficient and rapid manner.&nbsp; But how do you decide which is which?&nbsp; Often, two (or more) SSOs are working on  separate standards to solve the same problem where only one standard will be  likely to be adopted.&nbsp; How do you decide  which standard will emerge victorious?&nbsp;  When you want to find a venue in which to develop a mission critical  standard, how do you decide which existing SSO &ndash; if any - is the right one to  approach?&nbsp; Finally, even the largest  technology companies would have a hard time finding the resources to join every  SSO that is arguably relevant to its business, so which ones should make the  cut?</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Dilemmas like these are a  constant in the world of standard setting, but as with many questions in the  ICT space, the information needed to inform good choices is not always easy to  come by, and for those new to the process, even the questions to ask are not  immediately obvious.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In this issue, I focus on  how to maximize the value of participating in the standard setting process,  with a particular emphasis on knowing what to look for in an SSO, and on how to  find an SSO that makes the grade.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">I begin that task in my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>,  in which I note that there does not currently exist a well-respected career  track in the United States to become what might be called a &quot;standards  professional,&quot; notwithstanding the hundreds of millions of dollars spent  annually in participating in standard setting, and the strategic importance of  the standards that are created.&nbsp; Absent  recognition of standard setting as a professional discipline, it is unlikely  that a sufficient pool of talented and well-trained individuals will emerge to  provide the management that SSOs require to execute well.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong> this month provides an in-depth primer on how to determine one's role relative  to a given area of standard setting, how to define the goals to be achieved in  that area, and finally how to find an SSO that is likely to be the right choice  in which to achieve those goals.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">My <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection for this month uses two announcements made by Oracle last week to  illustrate a less obvious, but nonetheless common reason for joining an  SSO.&nbsp; In this case, Oracle announced  that it was joining the Free Standards Group at the highest (and most  expensive) level of membership at the same time that it revealed its plans to  provide reduced-rate support for users of Red Hat's Linux distribution.&nbsp; In so doing, Oracle signaled its commitment to  work with, rather than against, the Linux community.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> piece for October I go off  topic, providing what I hope is a provocative question with an interesting  answer.&nbsp; The title of the piece is  &quot;The Wikipedia and the Death of Archaeology.&quot;&nbsp; If you happen to know Google's Sergey Brin,  Larry Page or Eric Schmidt, shoot them a copy and tell them that they could  provide a huge service to the future by archiving the Wikipedia of today. </p>
                  <div align="left" class="style2">As  always, I hope you enjoy this issue.&nbsp;</div>

              <p align="left" class="style2">How important are standards in the  world of information and communications technology?&nbsp; On a scale of &quot;not important&quot; to &quot;damn  important,&quot; I would cast my vote to place them at the profane end of the  spectrum.&nbsp; Assuming that judgment is on  target, I find it curious that so little attention is paid to how standards are  created. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The great majority of all ICT  standards are developed today within consortia that have been formed within the  last decade, and more of are being created all the time.&nbsp; Happily, there are a large number of such  organizations that are well-respected and highly effective, and which provide  an essential function in the modern ICT world.&nbsp;  But who created these new standard setting organizations created by, and  who manages them once they are off the ground?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Based on my own experience working  with more than 75 such organizations, it is the exception rather than the rule  that a new consortium is created by those with significant prior experience in  creating such organizations.&nbsp; Often,  most or all of the representatives of the founding members are from the  marketing or business side of the house, and may have had little real  experience with the operation of standard setting organizations, although they  may have a firm grasp on their strategic function.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This may be because few  individuals can be found in most corporations today that could be considered to  be true &quot;standards professionals&quot; &ndash; people with comprehensive  hands-on experience working with standard setting organizations.&nbsp; True, there are business and marketing  employees that may spend a significant amount of time working with one or more  standard setting organizations in some capacity for some part of their  career.&nbsp; And there are far more  engineers that participate in standard setting organizations, often throughout  their careers.&nbsp; But business and  marketing employees are not likely to be skilled in designing an effective  technical process, and engineers are less likely to have the opportunity to  participate in the financial, recruiting, accounting, marketing, public  relations or other aspects of running a successful consortium.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As a result, I often encounter a  new consortium that has been cobbled together from loose pieces that can be  begged, borrowed or copied in approximate form from existing  organizations.&nbsp; Some of these pieces  were themselves poorly conceived, or are reused in the wrong context.&nbsp; The result is a new organization that may  look approximately right, but may or may not actually work very well in  practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">All of this is not too surprising,  since not only are there too few people with deep experience in forming and  managing consortia, but the &quot;how to&quot; book on the subject has yet to  be written (this site, and its <a href="http://205.134.252.89/essentialguide/">Essential  Guide</a> section in particular, representing perhaps the closest approximation  available).&nbsp; Even documented best  practices are few in number, because successful consortia are busy enough  documenting best practices relating to the standards they were chartered to  create.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Over time, I have developed quite  a complete set of documents to cover just about every aspect of consortium  planning, formation, governance, business and standards process operation,  intellectual property regulation, certification, branding and so on.&nbsp; But merely having such paper tools to  operate by is not the same as knowing in detail why they are the way they are,  how they should be used, and when they should be changed.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Even when a new consortium has  been properly structured, its founders face another problem:&nbsp; there is no real pool of professionals  available to hire to manage a consortium, because few individuals have made a  career in that capacity.&nbsp; When a new  consortium wishes to hire an executive director, business development vice  president, or director of the technical process, it is usually necessary to  hire someone from the generic management pool, who lacks the specific  management experience needed to run an SSO, and who may not function well in a  mostly virtual organization with little administrative or other support.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Fortunately, there are a few  management companies that host consortia and provide management services, but  they are few in number, and that number ebbs and flows with fluctuations in the  economy.&nbsp; Only a few provide a complete  range of services and have broad experience in supporting standard setting  organizations.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, while engineering schools  are supposed to provide some level of instruction relating to standards and  their development, courses dedicated to this topic are almost nonexistent.&nbsp; Instead, standards are dealt with piecemeal  through brief mentions in other courses - an ad hoc approach that lacks  cohesiveness.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The result is that while there are  many individuals become comfortable and capable participating in standard  setting technical committees over time, few gain the kind of experience that  would qualify them to run a successful standard setting organization, or to  serve as a well-informed director of an SSO.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">One reason for this state of  affairs may be that accumulating experience in standard setting does not appear  to have significant resume value.&nbsp; I  have heard this from many people within corporations, and that's a shame, given  the importance of standards to ITC business models, and the degree to which  knowledge and experience about standard setting can enable a member to have  greater influence within standard setting organizations.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In a better world, identification  as a &quot;standard setting professional&quot; would be a credential of  significance that would add luster to a resume, give rise to greater  opportunities of advancement, and result in higher compensation.&nbsp; Absent such recognition, there will be  little motivation for those that come in contact with the standard setting  process to do more than meet basic expectations, and look forward to moving on.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">If standards are as important as I  believe they are, its time for the concept of a &quot;standards  professional&quot; to become recognized, and for employers to send the message  that qualification as such is a smart move for those wishing to advance their  career.</p>

              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Introduction: </em></strong>Today, there are hundreds of  standard setting organizations (SSOs) maintaining hundreds of thousands of  standards. In addition to organizations primarily concerned with standard  setting, there are many whose mission is to promote the acceptance or  proliferation of new standards-based technologies, products or services, either  in conjunction with standard setting activities or as their sole reason for  being. </p>
              <p class="style2">As a result, it would be a rare vendor or  service provider that could not find anywhere from several dozen to literally  hundreds of accredited standards development organizations (SDOs) and, in the  information technology and communications (ICT) sector, unaccredited SSOs  (commonly referred to as consortia) whose goals were germane to its own  success.&nbsp; But for all but the largest  global corporations (some of which are active members of hundreds of SDOs and  consortia), participation in all relevant SSOs would not be practical from  either a financial or a human resources point of view.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">There are other reasons for  exercising selectivity as well, including the fact that not all SSOs are  equally effective, respected, efficient or neutral.&nbsp; For all these reasons, it is only prudent for any organization to  properly investigate a prospective organization before applying for membership,  whether its interest and budget extend to a single SSO membership or to  hundreds.</p>
              <p class="style2"> At the same time, it is  important to recognize that those that participate in standards development and  related activities have different motivations for doing so, and look to gain  benefits that vary as well.&nbsp; This  differentiation in position may make one SSO more attractive to a given  potential member than another, and if one type of participant is better  represented in one SSO rather than the other, the dynamics and outcomes of  those two SSOs may differ as well.</p>
              <p class="style2"> In this article, I will  describe the different types of participants that are active in standard  setting, the goals that are common to each category, and the SSO benefits that  are likely to be of greatest interest to each.&nbsp;  I will then lay out guidelines intended to assist anyone evaluating  whether a given SSO is appropriate to join, with a special emphasis on those  that are interested in joining SSOs that set standards for the ICT industry. <br>
                              <br>
                              <strong>I &nbsp;&nbsp;The Generic SSO Value Proposition</strong></p>
              <p class="style2"> A  reasonable threshold question to ask is why anyone should join an SSO at  all?&nbsp; Given that participation can be  expensive and time consuming, why not simply utilize the standards that others  develop and that the market has already begun adopting? </p>
              <p class="style2"> In  point of fact, playing a passive role is what many choose to do, thereby saving  on time and expense, as well as avoiding the risk of early-adopting a standard  that may ultimately fail in the marketplace. &nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that so many tens of thousands of universities,  government agencies, individuals and companies do choose to participate  actively in voluntary, consensus-based standard setting activities, however,  offers clear proof that significant benefits may be gained from diving into the  standard setting process rather than standing aside.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Benefits of participation.</em></strong>&nbsp;  Those benefits include the following, among others:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Strategic Influence.</em></strong>&nbsp; Those that participate in the governing  bodies of SSOs decide which standards will be created, and in what order, and  to serve what purposes.&nbsp; </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Technical influence.</em></strong>&nbsp; After a working group has been chartered,  there are still many decisions to be made among technical details,  architectural approaches and final results.&nbsp;  The members that join the working group make these decisions, subject  only to such level of oversight, if any, as the given SSO may provide or  require.&nbsp; A member that successfully  nominates the Chair of such a working group gains additional influence over the  result.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Early access.</em></strong>&nbsp; While many SSOs (and especially SDOs) allow some degree of public  access to the ongoing work of a working group, others do not allow the public  to review a specification until it is in final draft form, or has been actually  adopted.&nbsp; Members have early access to  information relating to an evolving standard, and can use that knowledge  contemporaneously to formulate and implement their own design and product  strategies based on their knowledge of where a draft specification is heading,  while those on the outside must wait until a public draft is released to make  the same decisions.&nbsp; As a result, SSO  members that can make use of early information enjoy a strategic advantage that  non-members do not share.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Training.</em></strong>&nbsp;  The representatives of vendors and others that participate in a design  process frequently gain valuable experience in the process.&nbsp; Many SSOs also conduct training seminars,  produce white papers, and offer other benefits that provide useful information  and training opportunities for member employees.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Messaging.</em></strong>&nbsp;  Corporations often signal and emphasize their commitment to markets,  technologies or architectures by joining the SSOs that are creating the  standards that are essential to the strategic direction being underlined.&nbsp; When vendors do so, they typically join the  SSO at the highest (and most expensive) available level of membership, to  emphasize their point.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Joint marketing.</em></strong>&nbsp; Many consortia engage in marketing as well  as technical activities.&nbsp; While  consortium budgets are virtually never sufficient to perform marketing on a  corporate scale, they do provide a venue within which marketing messages and  strategies can be agreed upon and coordinated, within which collateral  materials can be created, and whereby related costs can be shared.</li>
                <li class="style2"><em><strong>C</strong></em><strong><em>ertification and branding.</em></strong>&nbsp; SSOs can also  provide a venue for other supporting activities, such as &quot;plugfests&quot;  that permit implementers to determine whether their products or services  conform to the standards created by the SSO, and whereby such compliance can be  branded, using trademarks created and owned by the SSO, and licensed to those  that successfully pass the required tests. <a href="#1">1</a> </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">SSOs  are sensitive to the fact that no one can be compelled to become a member, and  therefore structure themselves and operate in such a way as to provide an  attractive value proposition for all constituencies that are needed to create  both effective standards as well as to provide enough early adopters to  convince non-members that adopting the standards of the SSO is a sensible thing  to do.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personalizing the Value Proposition</strong></p>
              <p class="style2"> While  SSOs offer a broad range of benefits, those benefits are not uniformly  attractive to all types of members with an interest in standards.&nbsp; As a result, it is helpful for anyone  considering participation in the standard setting process to identify where  they fit into the standards ecosystem in order to identify those benefits that  are likely to be important to them in accomplishing their goals.&nbsp; Otherwise, the process of identifying which  SSO to join, and what category of membership to seek, becomes an inexact  exercise that may result in overpayment, or failure to achieve desired results. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Placing  oneself in the standards ecosystem involves determining a number of factors, including<em> relationship to standards</em>, industry <em>identity</em>, and desired <em>role</em> in the standard setting process, each of which is addressed  in detail below.</p>
              <span class="style2"><strong><em>Relationship to Standards.</em></strong>&nbsp; Broadly  speaking, there are two primary relationships that anyone can have to a given  standard: as a <em>proponent</em>, and as a <em>consumer</em> <a href="#2">2</a>.              Standards are  developed by those that have each type of relationship the standard under  development, but these two categories of developers do not share all of the  same concerns and goals.&nbsp; As a result,  the decisions that each may make in relation to a given SSO are likely to be in  some respects different. <a href="#3">3</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">Standards  proponents hope to reap benefits from specific standards coming into being, and  (usually) from those standards being developed to meet specific criteria.&nbsp; Those benefits include the development of  new markets for goods and services, maintaining or attacking the advantages  enjoyed by existing market incumbents, and the more profitable extension of  existing capabilities and revenue sources into the future (all of which will be  discussed in greater detail below).&nbsp; As  a result, proponents are likely to play more active roles in SSOs, and are  invariably the founders of new consortia.</p>
              <span class="style2">Consumers as a generality have less interest in  which specific standards development efforts are launched, but are interested  in whether and how they can employ those standards in their businesses or other affairs. <a href="#4">4</a>              As a result, they  tend to be less concerned with the future activities of an SSO, and more  interested in aspects such as early access to information and training  opportunities.&nbsp; Of course, a given SSO  will often be relevant to a given entity in its capacity as both a proponent  and as a consumer. <a href="#5">5</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">This  distinction between proponents and consumers is fundamental to almost everything  that follows below, and will dictate in large measure not only which SSOs will  be attractive to a given potential member, but also what membership level it  will select, and in which activities it will participate.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Identity.</em></strong>&nbsp; SSO  participants also fall into constituencies defined by their identity, with  certain categories of participant predominating.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the interests and goals of these discrete  groups will differ to varying degrees one from the other.&nbsp; The groups that most frequently participate  in SSOs (in rough order of numbers of participants) are: <em>vendors</em> <em>and  other commercial entities</em>, <em>universities and colleges</em>, <em>governmental  bodies</em> of all levels, <em>individuals,</em> and <em>consumer  groups and other non-profits.</em> </p>
              <p class="style2"> While  the goals of a potential member may be obvious to it, the goals of other types  of members may be less so.&nbsp; If a given  SSO is dominated by members of an identity other than that of the potential  member evaluating that SSO, then the SSO in question may prove to be a less  fruitful venue for participation.&nbsp;  Understanding where all types of participants in the standard setting  process are coming from is therefore an important aspect of choosing an SSO,  and in knowing what to expect after joining.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Vendors and other commercial entities.</em></strong>&nbsp; This category  forms the largest, most motivated, and most economically influential category  of members in most SSOs.&nbsp; This is  especially true in the ICT sector, where standards are particularly pervasive  and essential, and where new products, markets and services emerge and grow  obsolete more quickly than in traditional industry.&nbsp; As a result, standards tend to more frequently have strategic  interest, and there is therefore a particularly high degree of participation by  standards proponents, as compared to standards
                consumers. <a href="#6">6</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">This is particularly  true among vendors and other commercial members, because the benefits of  participation are usually higher for the vendor proponents than vendor  consumers.&nbsp; In consequence, it is easier  to recruit proponents (and particularly so in the early days of a consortium),  and SSOs often have to work harder to attract consumers as members, sometimes  creating different classes of membership, or even lower dues within the same  class of members, for non-vendor members. <a href="#7">7</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Universities.</em></strong>&nbsp; University and college budgets for professorial participation in  SSOs are limited (and SSOs often provide discounted rates to encourage academic  participation in consequence), both in respect of membership fees as well as  attendant costs, such as travel.&nbsp; While  academic representatives do not often have direct economic stakes in the  outcome of standards development efforts, they do have professional interests  in what standards are set, and how they are structured.&nbsp; In this sense, they are sometimes  non-commercial proponents.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Universities  and colleges are standards consumers as well, and some institutions (such as  most state and some private universities) are very substantial enterprises in  their own right.&nbsp; As a result, two  different constituencies exist within such institutions, and each can have  different evaluation and approval processes, depending upon the participating  group (academic department, administration, IT services, etc.), the goals for  participation, and its sources of revenue.</p>
              <p class="style2"> In  the case of academic staff, standards development may be related to, or an  extension of, research.&nbsp; In this case,  staff may wish to participate to observe, to influence, or to discuss the  development of the standards at hand, and participation would focus on those  organizations that are active in disciplines of academic interest, such as  computer science and geospatial information.&nbsp;  The costs of participation may be funded by the general departmental  budget, or derive from grants or other external funding.</p>
              <p class="style2">For infrastructural staff, goals will be  similar to those of other standards consumers, and costs will be allocated from  the general operating budget.&nbsp; As a  generality, the larger the institution, the more complex the infrastructure it  will have, the better-paid its senior staff will be, and the more likely it  will be that individual employees (e.g., IT staff) will wish to have the same  opportunity to participate in SSOs as they would enjoy in the commercial  sector.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Government.</em></strong>&nbsp; Governmental entities have the unique role  of being not only standards consumers and proponents, but also standards  developers in their own right, through the adoption of laws and regulations  that function as standards.&nbsp; Moreover,  they enjoy a symbiotic relationship with SSOs, in that they also adopt SSOs  standards into regulations by referencing and requiring compliance with those  standards.&nbsp; Governments therefore  participate in SSOs at every level, from legislators and staff that liaise with  SSOs, to federal agencies that are required to utilize SSO
                standards, <a href="#8">8</a> to  state agencies, to cities, towns and counties.&nbsp;  Such participation is particularly common in the ITC sector. </p>
              <p class="style2">When government  entities participate in SSOs as consumers, they rarely join at levels that  would entitle them to act on Boards of Directors or in other control functions,  due to the relationship of government with the private sector.&nbsp; However, government agencies sometimes fund  testbed projects or other standards-related activities, thereby providing a  level of funding not often available through any other means. <a href="#9">9</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Individuals.</em></strong>&nbsp; While the  majority of consortia either do not permit individuals to become members, or do  not make it economically attractive to do so, many SDOs offer memberships with  meaningful participation rights in exchange for modest membership fees.&nbsp; This is due in part to the accreditation  rules under which SDOs operate (which stress openness of access), and in part  because some SDOs (such as the IEEE) are also professional associations.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Individuals  may participate in SSOs at the behest of their employers, with the knowledge  and cooperation of their employers, or completely independent of their  &quot;day jobs.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their conduct in  standard setting may therefore be independent, or very much at the direction of  their employers.</p>
              <p class="style2"> In  the latter case, there may be little difference in the behavior of a nominally  individual member and a representative of a commercial member.&nbsp; In the former case, however, the motivations  of the individual may vary widely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> Individuals  that participate in standard setting other than in the scope of their  employment do so for a variety of reasons, including education, the ability to  make a difference within their areas of expertise, to network, and out of pure  professional interest.&nbsp; However, their  ability to participate in face-to-face activities is likely to be less than  that of individuals whose time is released and whose expenses are being paid by  their employers.&nbsp; Nonetheless, where  they participate in SSOs that have a &quot;one member, one vote,&quot; rule,  the influence of individuals over outcomes can be real.</p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Consumer groups and other  non-profits.</em></strong>&nbsp; Not surprisingly,  it is a challenge to attract consumers, or their representatives, to become  members of SSOs, even where they set standards that impact non-commercial  end-users.&nbsp; Individuals are rarely  interested in such activities in their capacity as standards consumers, and  consumer groups do not have the resources to participate in the many SSOs that  do have such an impact.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there  is participation by such groups in many SSOs (and particularly SDOs, which are  more interested in attracting them), and particularly where the standards being  created are intended to support (or, if deficient, could have a negative  impact) on health, safety, or other core areas of consumer concern.</p>
              <p class="style2">A  variety of other non-profit groups may participate in SSOs as well.&nbsp; These organizations may be research groups,  trade associations, and (most frequently) other SSOs, which sometimes trade  memberships on a no-fee basis, and often maintain less formal liaison  relationships under simple memoranda of understanding.&nbsp; <br>
                  <strong><em>Influence and representation:</em></strong>&nbsp; The exact mix of member identities will vary  widely from SSO to SSO, depending upon factors such as the domain being  addressed (e.g., education vs. office productivity software) they address.&nbsp; That being said, the number and influence of  participants, by type, in a typical ITC SSO might be graphically represented as  follows:</p>
              <p align="center" class="style2"><img src="/images/graphbig.jpg" width="669" height="430"></p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>SSO participation roles.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong>After  determining one's relationship to standards and identity for purposes of this  exercise, it becomes possible to put those determinations to work by deciding  what type of <strong><em>role</em></strong> in the standard setting process should be  sought in order to make participation worthwhile.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Like  Caesar's Gaul, the universe of standard setting participants can be divided  into three parts: those for whom SSO participation is highly important (or even  essential) to their business (or other) success, those for whom SSO  participation is a logical extension of their technical, promotional, research  or other activities, and those for whom participation is elective or optional. </p>
              <p class="style2">                One  may logically think of these three groups as the <strong><em>Leaders</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Followers</em></strong>,  and the <strong><em>Spectators</em></strong>.&nbsp; Each  of these groups has different goals, and therefore needs to find an SSO that  provides the tools and opportunities to achieve those goals.</p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>The Leaders.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaders may be thought of as those members  for whom participation is most critical, based upon a desire to accomplish one  or more of the following: </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Market creation:</em></strong>&nbsp; This is the most critical strategic       role that a standard can play: to create a new market which would not       exist &quot;but for&quot; broad industry agreement on a new standard       (e.g., to enable high definition television, or to make wireless networks       possible). </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Market conditioning:</em></strong>&nbsp; Few single companies have the resources       required to condition a market to demand a new product (WiFi chips and       routers), service (WiMax) or computing model (service oriented       architecture).&nbsp; However, combining       the marketing resources of multiple companies to promote any of these &ndash; or       simply announcing that the majority of the big players in an industry have       committed to the new offering &ndash; can achieve that goal more reliably and at       far lower per-company cost. </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Collaborative R&amp;D:</em></strong>&nbsp; In some cases, using a consortium as an       extension of the members' own research and development efforts, backed by       the commitment to utilize the standardized product of that R&amp;D, can       create high-quality technology at a far lower per-member cost (examples of this       process include the original Sematech, for chip design, the X Consortium       for the X Windows system, and the many open source projects in existence       today). </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Ejecting an  incumbent:</em></strong>&nbsp; Standards efforts have frequently been used  in an effort to displace a powerful incumbent that has succeeded in creating a  monopoly, or near-monopoly, position in a product area based upon a &quot;de  facto&quot; standard controlled by
                it alone. <a href="#10">10</a> </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Not surprisingly,  companies that find themselves faced with such challenges are often willing to  form a new consortium to accomplish the task at hand if they conclude that no  existing SDO or consortium exists that would be adequate or appropriate to the task. <a href="#11">11</a> The  same companies are often willing to make a larger investment in the creation of  a new organization than is borne by those that join the same organization at a  later date, and also assume a greater risk that their investment will not prove  to be rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other companies with  the same needs typically are the first to join such a consortium after it has  been announced by its founders. </p>
              <span class="style2">Some of the world's largest technology companies  (e.g., IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Motorola) have been particularly active  in forming consortia, as so many aspects of their businesses are dependent on  the predictable adoption of new standards and business models. However, many  consortia have been launched by groups of smaller companies as well,  particularly where a technology is very new, or is relevant to a smaller market  niche. These founders have usually concluded that such an effort provided the  only way in which their meager resources could be deployed to reach an  ambitious and essential goal. <a href="#12">12</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">While  forming a new consortium requires expenditures of time and expense by the founders,  the strategic price of not creating a particular standard when it is needed can  far outweigh the out of pocket and time costs attendant in taking part.&nbsp; Costs of non-participation can include  missing the opportunity to steer a standard in the manner most compatible with  a company's product offerings, falling behind competitors, or failing to head  off broad adoption of a second standard not conducive to a company's legacy  offerings. </p>
              <span class="style2">For better or worse, &quot;Leader&quot;  companies in this category sometimes expect to control the strategy and  direction of a consortium for some period of time, rather than to merely  participate in its activities. Typically, they are willing to pay the highest  fees in order to do so, and most consortia rely disproportionately on such  companies for their operating budgets, particularly in their early years of operation. <a href="#13">13</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">Not  surprisingly, &quot;Leader&quot; members are almost invariably vendors. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>The Followers.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most SSO members (Leaders included) hope to enjoy some subset of  the following types of benefits: </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">influencing the direction in which a given       standard or group of standards may evolve </li>
                <li class="style2">receiving advance knowledge of the direction in       which standard setting efforts are heading, and thus being able to launch       new compliant products before non-participants </li>
                <li class="style2">gaining early access to test suite software and       certification testing of compliant products </li>
                <li class="style2">collaborating on creating &quot;white       papers&quot;, commissioning analysis, agreeing upon joint marketing       programs, creating consortium presence at trade shows, and other       cooperative efforts </li>
                <li class="style2">sending staff to consortium meetings to receive       training and stay abreast of new techniques and technology </li>
                <li class="style2">publicly demonstrating commitment to specific       new markets and technologies </li>
                <li class="style2">influencing others in the industry </li>
                <li class="style2">meeting other interested players in a given       niche and forming partnerships with other companies </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Companies  in this group usually wish to have full rights of participation in all  activities, but may be less interested in influencing the strategic direction  of the efforts and goals of the organization.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> Follower  members that want voting rights most typically are vendors and other commercial  entities, governmental entities, universities and colleges, with government and  academic members often receiving the same benefits for lower fees.&nbsp; Where memberships are inexpensive,  individuals may be found in this category as well</p>
              <p class="style2"> Not  all of the benefits listed above are of interest to companies that are more  interested in participation than influence.&nbsp;  Most consortia therefore offer a less expensive class of membership that  permits attendance and participation in all activities, but not the right to  vote.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Follower  companies that do not care about voting can be of any type, as well as  non-profit groups and individuals.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>The Spectators.</em></strong>&nbsp; For many companies and individuals, there is a desire to know  what a given consortium is doing or producing, but little need to dedicate any  significant degree of resources to the effort.&nbsp;  Typically, this group comprises academics and commercial entities of any  type (e.g., developers, consultants, integrators, etc.). Such members wish to  acquire, through an appropriate category of membership, knowledge of: </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">new standards as they are released </li>
                <li class="style2">who has joined a given standards or promotional       effort </li>
                <li class="style2">the nature of evolving &quot;best       practices&quot; </li>
                <li class="style2">which standards are likely to be adopted and       which not </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Many  SSOs create an inexpensive class of membership to satisfy such needs. The  rights of such a class are typically limited to the distribution of information  (increasingly in electronic information only). In some cases, this distribution  is in advance of public disclosure.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>III  &nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluating a Specific Consortium</strong> </p>
              <p class="style2"> Prior  to joining an SSO, it is helpful to define the goals of participation with  respect to a given areas of standardization (which are likely to vary from case  to case), in order to generate a list of what is important to find in an SSO,  and what is not.&nbsp; Where an important  goal is to have influence on which standards efforts are launched, choosing among  available options is particularly important.&nbsp;  In some cases, this exercise can lead to a conclusion that no existing  SSO is appropriate for the task at hand, and that the only alternative is to  consider whether forming a new organization is necessary.&nbsp; Where this is the conclusion, the next step  is to determine whether such a project would be feasible, taking into account  whether there would be sufficient interest among other potential members, and  the time, costs and effort required relative to the anticipated benefits of the  exercise.</p>
              <span class="style2"><strong><em>Defining Goals</em></strong><em>.</em> Not surprisingly,  the first step to take in evaluating a specific SSO (and especially if there is  more than one organization to choose from in a given area) is to define the  goals that participation should serve. Only after those goals have been  outlined can the adequacy of a given SSO be determined to meet the current  need. Often (for example) an SSO may be primarily technical in focus, while a  prospective member's needs may be entirely promotional. In such a case, the  value of participation may be insufficient to justify the costs, particularly  if no lower cost membership levels are offered.&nbsp; Again, where two alternatives exist, one SSO may be primarily  promotional in nature, while the other may focus principally on standard  setting. Depending on a member's specific needs, it may suffice to join one or  the other, or on occasion to commit to both. <a href="#14">14</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">It  is especially important to determine what role will need to be assumed in an  SSO in order to achieve the goals of joining.&nbsp;  If being a Spectator is sufficient, then many more SSOs will meet  minimum standards for participation.&nbsp;  However, if being a Leader is essential, then many more criteria will  become important in evaluating an SSO, such as effectiveness and speed of the  technical process, whether it would be easy to gain support for launching a  standards development project of particular interest, and whether the SSO  includes promotion as well as development of standards in its mission.</p>
              <p class="style2">Similarly, while it may be that an SSO exists in  the desired technical area, its current strategic direction may not be  compatible with the prospective member's own strategic goals. In such a case,  it may not be worth joining any organization at all, or it may be wise to join at  the highest (and most expensive) level with marketing partners, in an effort to  persuade the existing members of the desirability of steering the organization  in a different direction. <a href="#15">15</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>SSO characteristics:</em></strong>&nbsp;  Once armed with a list of goals, it might be assumed that determining  which SSO to join would be an easy task.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, there are many differences between SSOs, most of which  are meaningful.&nbsp; Some of these  differences are easy to find (e.g., costs of participation) simply by reviewing  the <br>
  SSO's Website, while others are more difficult investigation (e.g., how  &quot;open&quot; is the process of the SSO, and is that process dominated by a  group of companies?).&nbsp; Some of the more  important questions to ask are explored below.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>What is the fully burdened cost of membership?</em></strong>&nbsp; Membership fees for SSOs range from the  trivial to the breathtaking, with the highest and most influential level of  corporate membership level in a consortium typically costing from $10,000 to  $60,000.&nbsp; A modest number of consortia  have dues ranging up to $200,000, and a few require the payment of dues of $1  million or more.&nbsp; However, as discussed  below, almost all consortia, and many SDOs, have multiple membership classes,  and the differences in costs between classes of membership can be very  great.&nbsp; As a result, meaningful  participation is often possible even in an expensive SSO for a price that is  far less than is required to join at the highest membership level.</p>
              <p class="style2"> But  dues may represent only a part of the total economic commitment required to  meet a member's objectives. For example, if full participation involves regular  in-person attendance at meetings, travel expenses can become substantial.&nbsp; Such participation can be mandated by  less-obvious considerations, such as the SSO's rules of participation.&nbsp; For example, in order to ensure continuity  and avoid confusion and repetition, some SSOs condition voting or verbal  participation on consistent attendance (e.g., in order to fully participate, a  member representative must have attended at least two out of the three  preceding meetings). Some SSOs also require the dedication of the part or full  time services of one or more employees as a requirement of the highest  class(es) of membership. </p>
              <p class="style2">In the case of a small company, the requirement  to &quot;second&quot; one or more valued technical employees can be more  burdensome than the dues obligations of membership.&nbsp; On the other hand, some companies would regard the same  requirement as a valued perk, as the employee involved might exercise great  influence over the technical result, as well as become intimately familiar with  the optimal way of utilizing the standards which result from
                participation. <a href="#16">16</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">In recent years,  participation in many SSOs, and particularly consortia in the ITC sector, has  become less expensive, due to the development and deployment of sophisticated  Web-based platforms that enable collaborative efforts, list serves for  communication, archives for document access, and electronic platforms for  voting.&nbsp; As a result, much can be  accomplished remotely and more quickly than was the case when such activities  could only occur through face-to-face meetings, through conference calls, and  via the mails. <a href="#17">17</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">Regardless  of such new efficiencies, a prudent decision to participate in a given  consortium cannot be made until all aspects of productive participation have  been identified, and the real cost of that participation weighed against the  prospective benefits.</p>
               <span class="style2"><strong><em>How  open is the SSO?</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; While there  are variations in specific practices among SDOs, their processes and rules of  admission are reasonably uniform, due to the requirements for accreditation  that musts be observed. <a href="#18">18</a>              </span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p class="style2">Consortia, on the  other hand, are free to set their own rules, and those rules can vary  considerably.&nbsp; Increasingly, most  consortia operate on a basis that is very similar to SDOs, accepting any  qualified entity or individual as a member, and operating under rules that do  not give disproportionate influence to any class or type of members.&nbsp; As a result, the most noticeable difference  between well-respected consortia such as the W3C and OASIS is that consortia  are almost always global in membership, while SDOs have traditionally been  national in scope. <a href="#19">19</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">On the other hand,  there remain many non-accredited organizations that are far less open. <a href="#20">20</a> One  popular non-incorporated model for such an entity employs what is usually  called a &quot;promoter agreement,&quot; which may be entered into by  invitation only.&nbsp; The promoter agreement  provides a cross license among all adopters as to any patent claims that may be  infringed by the implementation of the standards created by the group, and each  promoter is permitted in turn to sublicense those rights to implementers under  an &quot;adopter agreement.&quot;&nbsp; While  this mechanism provides an effective and efficient means for addressing  intellectual property rights (IPR) issues, the invitation-only foundation upon  which such organizations are built does not lead to what would be considered to  be &quot;open standards.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">Between these two  extremes there are many gradations of influence to be found, including  organizations with membership criteria that may be more restrictive than  necessary, that have boards of directors that are not as accessible to  later-joining members, that are not representative of all relevant  constituencies, or that have other flaws that make them less conducive to  creating &quot;open standards.&quot; <a href="#20">21</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Will the SSO (or the standard of interest) be  successful?</em></strong>&nbsp; It is of  course important to evaluate whether a consortium which otherwise appears  appropriate is likely to be able to deliver on its promises.&nbsp; As with any other type of non-profit or  for-profit enterprise, some SSOs are better structured, governed, managed,  effective, and stable than others.&nbsp; Where  an SSO has earned respect and enjoys a solid reputation for producing standards  that are usually widely adopted, it can be assumed that participation is more  likely to be rewarding without spending a great deal of time investigating such  questions.&nbsp; Obviously, where the  reputation of an SSO is just the opposite, it is more likely that it would be a  waste of time to join.&nbsp; However, such a  conclusion should not be reached lightly, since SSOs are just as likely to be  attacked or criticized unfairly as are the commercial entities that join them. </p>
              <p class="style2"> Joining  a new or recently formed consortium that has not yet earned a reputation  necessarily requires more innovative diligence. The level of investigation will  vary, depending on the goals of the consortium.&nbsp; For example, if the mission of the consortium is primarily to  promote an existing technology, its success will largely be a product of  whether it is well run and can attract a sufficient number of members to fund  its programs and cooperate on its initiatives.&nbsp;  The goals of the prospective member will also factor into the  evaluation: if those goals are primarily educational and independent of whether  or not the primary goals of the consortium are achieved, then the ultimate  success or failure of the consortium may be irrelevant, so long as the quality  of the programming is high. </p>
              <p class="style2">Conversely, a company faced with the necessity  of adopting one competing standard over another can ill afford to back the  wrong technological horse.&nbsp;&nbsp; In short,  the degree of diligence to perform in investigating a given SSO will generally  be proportional to whether the applicant wishes to be a Spectator, Follower or  Leader.&nbsp; The choice becomes particularly  acute where there is already a standards war in process, because the  consequences of backing the wrong technology can be
                severe. <a href="#22">22</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">Trying  to decide whether a given SSO that has yet to establish a reputation is likely  to launch successful standards can be informed by looking into the following  factors: </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Positive support:</em></strong>&nbsp; Which vendors have already aligned       themselves with a given standard or SSO?&nbsp;       If the most significant players in the industry are backers, then,       all other things being equal, the likelihood of the SSO's or standard's       ultimate success is high, as potential implementers will be likely to       believe that wide adoption is a foregone conclusion.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Non-support:</em></strong>&nbsp; as significantly, which companies are not backing       the standard?&nbsp; At times, the bulk       of the market may be expected to align itself against a given company, or       group of companies.&nbsp; Whether or not       the challengers will succeed in displacing a powerful incumbent is       particularly hard to predict (the answer is most often in the negative). </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>How open is the SSO?</em></strong>&nbsp; If one (or a small number of allied       companies) have locked in control of an SSO, then there is the potential       for the standards generated by the organization to be perpetually slanted       in favor of the control group.&nbsp;       Whether or not this skewing of result in fact occurs, the       consortium's standards may be expected to be regarded with suspicion, and       may not be widely adopted in consequence. </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Staff resources:</em></strong>&nbsp; How well is the SSO funded and       staffed?&nbsp; While there are examples       of all-volunteer consortia that have been quite successful, this type of       organization requires greater commitment by both members as well as their       representatives.&nbsp; If a consortium       that lacks paid staff also lacks a culture of strong committee chairs,       timely process and continuity of membership, its efforts are vulnerable to       failure. </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Member       resources:</em></strong>&nbsp; While SSO       staff support the standards development process, standards are developed       by SSO member representatives.&nbsp; If       existing member participation in the technical process is not robust, then       the standards that the SSO creates may not only be of poor quality, but       they will be very unlikely to be widely adopted as well.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Funding:</em></strong>&nbsp; How realistic is the SSO's budget?&nbsp; While vigorous member participation is the  most important resource factor, and standards development can be a very low  budget operation, certain actions essential to success do require
                funding. <a href="#23">23</a> </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Leadership:</em></strong>&nbsp; How strong and committed are the SSOs       leaders?&nbsp; The most successful SSOs       often have well-recognized, trusted and inspirational leaders (Tim       Berners-Lee, of the World Wide Web Consortium and Jim Thomas, of ASTM, an       SDO, are current examples, while Robert Scheifler, of the former X Consortium,       was instrumental to the success of that SSO). In the often rough and       tumble world of technology, a leader whose authority is respected is vital       to promoting the vision of the SSO and to maintaining strong recruitment. </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Technical       process:</em></strong>&nbsp; Is the process       efficient and rapid?&nbsp; Are the       working group chairs fair, respected and effective?</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Strategy:</em></strong>&nbsp; How appropriate are the consortium's       strategy and plan of execution?&nbsp;       Are they adequate to achieve its goals?&nbsp; Are they likely to gather wide support,       or to prove to be a lightning rod for opposition?</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>IPR policy:</em></strong>&nbsp; How mainstream is the intellectual       property rights policy of the organization?&nbsp; If it veers too far towards stringency, many companies       important to success may refuse to join.&nbsp;       If it steers too far in the other&nbsp;       direction, the standards developed will be more vulnerable to       &quot;submarine&quot; patents.&nbsp; If       open source implementations of the standards are important, is the IPR       policy conducive to such implementations? </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong><em>Stability:</em></strong>&nbsp; Some consortia are formed to create a       single standard, and then hand that standard off to another SSO for       long-term maintenance, while others are formed, like most SDOs, to provide       a long-term venue for developing standards within a certain domain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, a standards-related goal may       only be achieved through creating multiple related standards, together       with certification tests and a branding program, all of which will require       long-term maintenance.&nbsp; In such       cases, it is important to compare long-term goals with the capabilities of       a given SSO, to determine whether it is likely to have the degree of       longevity of existence that is needed to justify the investment of       participation. </li>
                </ul>
              <p class="style2">Unfortunately,  there is no single source of information to consult for answers to most of  these questions.&nbsp; Moreover, internal and  external information about SSOs is as prone to be inflated or misrepresented as  any other information that arises in the technology industry.&nbsp; As in all commercial situations, it can be  expected that a given SSO and its members will accentuate the positives, while  nay-sayers will resort to distortion. Fortunately, the larger consortia attract  sufficient attention from the press and analysts that at least some reasonably  informed third party verification can be found for the contentions of one camp  or the other.&nbsp; With a smaller SSO, a  dialogue directly with the Executive Director or another member of the  organization may be the most productive way to gain a sense of the strength and  prospects of the effort. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Where  information gathering proves inconclusive and upper level memberships are  expensive, a useful strategy can be to join at a lower membership level, and  subsequently upgrade (even before the initial membership year is completed) to  a higher level, if expectations are met.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joining an SSO</strong></p>
              <p class="style2"> When  all the information has been gathered that is appropriate, a final question  remains: what class of membership in a given SSO is most likely to lead to the  satisfaction of the applicant's goals?&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> While  the range of SSO structures is broad, the good news is that most organizations  have multiple membership classes offering a broad array of rights on a sliding  cost scale.&nbsp; For organizations with high  membership fees, these fees are often scaled proportionately to the revenues of  corporate members, and/or discounted for government and non-profit members.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Consortia  are particularly likely to offer multiple membership classes, in order to  provide a class of membership with a value proposition that is commensurate  with the economic realities of as large and wide a pool of potential members as  possible.&nbsp; A typical range of membership  classes to be found in a standard-setting consortium with a large number of  membership classes, and the principal benefits and obligations of each class,  would often be similar to the following</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"><strong><u>Strategic Member</u>:</strong>&nbsp; Guaranteed board seat, or reasonable  likelihood of eventually gaining one, and all privileges of lower categories of  membership (other than the right to vote for additional directors); can  nominate officers and committee chairs<br>
                    <strong>Appeals  to:</strong> Companies (usually vendors) that wish to set the strategic  objectives of the consortium<br>
                    <strong>Cost:</strong> $25,000 - $50,000, depending on revenues of member</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong><u>Technical Committee       Member</u>:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Full, voting       participation in all technical and marketing processes; as a class, can       elect three board representatives (perhaps with the type of member       specified, to ensure diversity of representation); may be invited to       provide a committee chair; all privileges of lower categories of       membership<br>
                    <strong>Appeals to:</strong> Companies, universities, colleges, and government       agencies wishing to influence the standards that are developed <br>
                    <strong>Cost:</strong> $15,000 - $25,000, depending on revenues or type of member </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong><u>Advisory Member</u>:</strong>&nbsp; Full non-voting participation in all       technical and marketing processes; all privileges of lower categories of       membership<br>
                    <strong>Appeals to:</strong> All types of members that wish to participate in, but       do not need to influence, the technical process, and that wish to have the       most timely information regarding technical direction and results<br>
                    <strong>Cost:</strong> $10,000 (regardless of revenues) </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong><u>Informational Member</u>:</strong>&nbsp; Receives periodic information regarding       technical and other programs, as well as standards as they are made public<br>
                    <strong>Appeals to:</strong> Academics, consultants, analysts, individuals<br>
                    <strong>Cost:</strong> $250 (regardless of revenues) </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Each  of the classes described above is crafted to appeal to potential members with a  particular focus.&nbsp; Using the categories  referred to in Section II above, Leaders will always join at the Strategic or  Technical Committee membership levels, Followers will usually join at the  Technical Committee or Advisory Member levels, and Spectators will join as  Advisory or Informational Members. </p>
              <p class="style2"> In  addition to differentiating by revenues in order to broaden participation,  consortia will at times provide the same benefits to different types of  companies for radically different prices.&nbsp;  This occurs where the participation of a particular type of company is  essential, but the market motivation of participation for that type of company  is low.&nbsp; One frequent example occurs in  consortia that are formed by hardware companies to achieve important strategic  goals.&nbsp; Achieving these goals often  depends upon securing the cooperation of independent software vendors (ISVs)  who have far less reason to be interested in whether or not those goals are  attained.&nbsp; In such a situation, hardware  vendors may pay very large dues, while ISVs may be invited to become members at  little or no cost. </p>
              <p class="style2"> A  final aspect to consider is the &quot;bundled&quot; value of benefits at a  given level of membership, as compared to the per-service cost of the various  activities that a prospective member may be interested in pursuing.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the top level of membership  may entitle a member to: </p>
              <ul type="disc">

              <p class="style2">The  next lowest class may provide all or some of the same services at a discount,  and so on.&nbsp; On occasion, and  particularly where the prospective member intends to participate fully, such  additional benefits may lead to a decision to join at a higher class. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>V  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institutionalizing  the Evaluation Process</strong> </p>
              <span class="style2">As noted at the beginning of this article, there  are many corporations today that are members of from 100 to more than 300 SDS  and consortia around the world.&nbsp; Given  the magnitude of such a commitment, it would be wise to institutionalize the  process of both evaluating SSOs before joining them, as well as monitoring the continuing  value of participation at the time of renewal. </span>
              <p class="style2">Perhaps surprisingly,  it does not appear that many companies have done so. <a href="#24">24</a> One  reason is that the decision to join an SSO is often made at the  &quot;local&quot; level (i.e., by a business unit rather than at the enterprise  level), and those that wish to join an SSO would be loath resistant to adding  another level of delay and bureaucracy to the process of joining an SSO.&nbsp; Beyond such motivations, simply knowing what  is happening within a multinational corporation is an enormous challenge that  is never completely realized.</p>
              <p class="style2">Be  that as it may, it should nonetheless be possible to lay out a methodology for  evaluating SSOs that could be distributed internally to provide guidance for  those managers that are engaged in standards-related activities.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Assuming  that a given company has concluded that SSO participation is appropriate to its  strategic direction, a prudent initial and ongoing program for managing that  participation could proceed as follows: </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Stage  One (implementation of program)</strong> </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">Establish budgetary parameters for SSO       participation</li>
                <li class="style2">Define internal approval requirements and       process for joining and renewal </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Stage  Two (selection of individual SSOs)</strong> </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">Create business case for       participation in a given area of standardization including role       (Leader/Follower/Spectator).&nbsp; If       Leader, define specific key objectives to be pursued</li>
                <li class="style2">Agree upon technical/marketing areas of interest </li>
                <li class="style2">Define any other goals within each area </li>
                <li class="style2">Identify existing potential SSO alternatives </li>
                <li class="style2">Evaluate each existing organization for       appropriateness, likelihood of success, reputation, etc. </li>
                <li class="style2">Examine intellectual property and other policies       for acceptability </li>
                <li class="style2">Determine fully-burdened       cost of participation at level necessary to achieve goals</li>
                <li class="style2">If no existing consortium seems appropriate,       consider whether founding a consortium is justified </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Stage  Three (joining and participating in a specific consortium)</strong> </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">Define specific goals to       guide member representatives (e.g., participate only, or seek approval of       specific new standard working groups)</li>
                <li class="style2">Commit to appropriate membership level to meet       goals </li>
                <li class="style2">Make appropriate staff assignments </li>
                <li class="style2">Obtain final internal budget approval </li>
                <li class="style2">Evaluate success of participation after ten       months (i.e., before renewal invoice arrives) </li>
                <li class="style2">Review and approve/disapprove renewal </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">While  the above level of bureaucratization may be excessive for a small company, for  a larger organization with a need for broad SSO participation, the effort to  establish such a program should be amply repaid in less haphazard  participation, lower over-all expenditures and greater rewards.&nbsp; For a smaller company, the same methodology  may productively be employed on a less formal basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                In  either case, the following table could be used in support of such an SSO  participation program.</p>

              <p class="style2"> In  the modern technology-based world, the range of for-profit, non-profit and  governmental organizations that should actively consider participating in SSOs  continues to increase.&nbsp; And, in fact,  the number of SSOs in existence and the number of participants in the standards  development progress in the ICT sector is also increasing.&nbsp; For some organizations, and particularly for  some vendors, the costs of such participation are becoming very great.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Based  on the author's experience, it appears that few companies are engaging in an  enterprise-wide evaluation of SSOs before joining them, and even fewer pay  close attention to renewals.&nbsp; In theory,  bringing an appropriate level of order to this process need not be a daunting  task.&nbsp; Moreover, the process laid out in  this article for evaluating SSO prior to making a decision to participate  should not only result in more cost-effective participation in  standards-related activities, but more empirically effective participation as  well, through greater identification of goals, better selection of venues to  pursue those goals, and closer attention to whether those goals have been  achieved. </p>

The terminology used  to describe the relationship of standards to standards implementers differs by  discipline.&nbsp; For example, to an  economist, someone using a standardized product is a &quot;consumer,&quot;  while to those actually developing an ICT standard, the same person is referred  to as an &quot;end-user.&quot;&nbsp; Both  camps are likely to refer to those that create a standard as a  &quot;developer,&quot; but as noted in this article, some developers have  purely utilitarian goals, while others have strategic intentions as well that  are better indicated by the word I have chosen to use in this article:&nbsp; <em>proponents.&nbsp; </em>Moreover, dividing discussion between &quot;developers&quot;  and &quot;consumers&quot; obscures the fact that (not surprisingly) the  developers of standards are often those that use them as well.</p>

To give a single  example, an SSO's reputation for neutrality is usually a positive to a  consumer, but may be a negative to a proponent that hopes to create a  standard.&nbsp; All else being equal, as  between two SSOs that could each serve as capably as the host for a new  standards project, the proponent of that project will choose the SSO in which  it enjoys the greater degree of influence.</p>

There are many  exceptions to the generality of this statement, and particularly so in the area  of information technology, where the availability and nature of appropriate  standards can be essential to the effective operation of a company.&nbsp; Although SSOs are more commonly created by  proponents, there are exceptions to this statement as well.&nbsp; For example, the CAD Framework Initiative  (no longer active) was created by CAD software users in an effort to influence  the behavior of CAD suppliers.&nbsp; More  recently, the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/jericho/">Jericho Forum</a> was  formed by standards consumers who desired better security solutions, and the<a href="http://www.chestandards.org/"> Coalition for eHealth Standards</a> (CHeS)  was created by hospitals to set common product identification and other  standards that their suppliers would be required to adopt in order to lower  costs and increase efficiencies in hospital supply purchasing. </p>

The decision for a  large company to join an SSO is usually made at a divisional or other operating  unit level, based upon the needs of the unit that processed the application,  rather than at the enterprise level, based on all of the needs of the  applicant.&nbsp; As a result, such a member  often uses its membership in only one capacity (proponent or consumer) through  poor internal communication, thereby obtaining less benefit from its membership  fee than need be the case.</p>

Moreover, the participation by ICT standards  proponents is often steroidal in contrast to that of proponents in more  traditional industries, where the progress of standards development activities  can often be more relaxed, collegial and consensual.</p>

The high strategic  value of ICT standards is one of the major reasons for the emergence and predominance  of consortia in this sector.&nbsp; At the  time when consortia first began to proliferate, SDOs were commonly perceived by  ICT vendors to be too slow moving, and too subject to influence by non-vendors.&nbsp; The solution was to simply create new, more  easily controlled, and more flexibly structured entities to set ICT  standards.&nbsp; With time, however, many  consortia have become as well-established, open and respected as their  accredited brethren.&nbsp; For more on the  rise of consortia and the continuing process of process evolution in standard  setting, see: Updegrove, Andrew, <em><a href="http://205.134.252.89/bulletins/may05.php#feature">Standards, Cycles and  Evolution: Learning from the Past in a New Era of Change</a></em>,  ConsortiumInfo.org, Consortium Standards Bulletin, Vol. IV, No. 5 (May 2005), <em>at </em><em>&lt;http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/aug05.php#feature&gt;,  and sources cited therein.</em></p>

In the United States,  the Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 and the related Office of  Management and Budget Circular A-119 require the Federal Agencies to utilize  private sector, as compared to &quot;government unique,&quot; standards  wherever possible, as well as to participate in their development.&nbsp; For more on the relationship of the U.S.  Federal government to standard setting, see: Updegrove, Andrew, <em><a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/jan05.php#feature">A Work in  Progress:&nbsp; Government Support for  Standard Setting in the United States: 1990 &ndash; 2004</a></em>, ConsortiumInfo.org,  Consortium Standards Bulletin, Vol. IV, No. 1 (January 2005), <em>at </em><em>&lt;  http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/jan05.php#feature&gt;, and sources  cited therein.</em></p>

In fact, far more efforts to unseat incumbents  through the use of standards have failed than succeeded, and particularly where  the target of the initiative was Microsoft.&nbsp;  Currently, the OpenDocument Format, which enjoys the strong support of  IBM and Sun, among others, is showing surprising momentum in its effort to  provide an alternative to Microsoft document formats.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="11"></a>11. There are many variations on this theme besides  forming a new standard setting organization.&nbsp;  For example, IEEE does not currently include promotional or  certification activities within its mandate.&nbsp;  However, instead of forming a new consortium to both develop standards  as well as perform these additional services, the corporate members of several  IEEE 802 wireless standard working groups have formed and funded a series of  external organizations (e.g., the <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/">WiFi Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.wimedia.org/en/index.asp">WiMedia Alliance</a> and the <a href="http://www.wimaxforum.org/home/">WiMax Forum</a>) to take up these  supporting tasks.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="12"></a>12. For more on when and how to create a consortium,  see the ConsortiumInfo.org Essential Guide to Standard Setting and Consortia  section entitled <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/forming/">Forming a  Consortium</a>, at &lt; http://www.consortiuminfo.org/forming/&gt;.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="13"></a>13. Whether or not the founders of a consortium seek  to exercise disproportionate control varies greatly, depending on whether they  have specific ideas about the standards to be created, as compared to the  generic need for such standards, their level of sophistication and experience,  and other factors.&nbsp; As a practical  matter, any such control tends to dissipate quickly (as to a given company or  companies) as membership increases, unless the consortium has been overtly  structured to avoid that result.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="14"></a>14. Recall the example in&nbsp; note 11 above of the separate entities that have grown up around  various IEEE 802 wireless standard working groups.&nbsp; Members of most identities discussed above would be interested  solely in the IEEE working group, while vendors would be very interested in  participating in the related alliances or forums that create and promote  certification tests and brands.</p>
              <p> <span class="style2"><a name="15"></a>15.It is an unfortunate reality of standard setting  that not all participants join SSOs with the intention of furthering their  standards development and promotional effort.&nbsp;  When a given standard can threaten the status quo, those with a vested  interest in the current state of affairs have been known to join SSOs solely  for the purpose for blocking or delaying the release of the standard in  question.&nbsp; Others may join simply to  keep an eye on what is happening in an SSO that they believe to be setting  standards that may threaten them.&nbsp;  Typically, this last group joins at a lower class of membership that  provides information, but not meaningful participation.</span></p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="16"></a>16.The track record of SSOs that have required  seconding of employees is at best mixed, with many members not following  through on their obligations.&nbsp; Often,  these requirements are dropped after reality sets in.&nbsp; As a result, when evaluating a new SSO, it is wise to consider  whether the organization is likely to be successful in achieving its goals if  the seconded employees do not materialize as required.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="17"></a>17. The current market leader in developing and  hosting SSO Websites appears to be Kavi, Inc.&nbsp;  A <a href="http://www.kavi.com/clients/">list of the SSOs</a> that it  currently serves can be found at &lt; http://www.kavi.com/clients/&gt;.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="18"></a>18. In the United States,  the accrediting body is the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI,  which both sets the criteria for accreditation as well as conducts audits to  confirm compliance.&nbsp; An <a href="http://www.ansi.org/conformity_assessment/overview/overview.aspx?menuid=4">overview</a> of ANSI's accreditation services, with links to more specific information, can  be found at  &lt;http://www.ansi.org/conformity_assessment/overview/overview.aspx?menuid=4&gt;</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="19"></a>19. Even this distinction is becoming increasingly  blurred, as SDOs such as the IEEE and ASTM have become global in their  memberships.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="20"></a>20. Historically, such organizations were often  named Special Interest Groups (SIGs), Alliances or Forums.&nbsp; However, these names are often now adopted  by consortia with very open policies, and therefore no conclusions should be  drawn from the particular name adopted by any non-accredited organization.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="21"></a>21. I have worked with over 75 consortia, and helped  to form most of them.&nbsp; In my experience,  while many founders of consortia are initially concerned with ensuring that  control of the new organization stays in the hands of those that are likely to  pursue the path the founders have in mind, these restrictions are almost always  eased (often quite quickly) when the need for such concerns proves to be  unfounded, and as the benefits of openness (including as regards recruitment)  become more evident.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="22"></a>22. The classic example of  the type of situation that a standards effort (and everyone else) hopes to  avoid is the battle that raged for years between the Betamax and VHS video  formats. Until that struggle was resolved in favor of VHS, vendors and  consumers alike were trapped in a confusing and expensive limbo of duplicative  inventories, more meager selections, and higher costs of doing business.&nbsp; Many of the same companies are now engaging  in a replay of the same debacle, this time lining up behind two competing DVD  standards: HD-DVD and Blu-Ray.&nbsp; For more  on the nature and consequences of standards wars, <em>see</em>: the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar06.php">March 2006</a> issue  of the Consortium Standards Bulletin at  &lt;http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar06.php&gt;, and particularly  Updegrove, Andrew, <em><a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar06.php#feature">Standards  Wars:&nbsp; Situations, Strategies and  Outcomes,</a></em> ConsortiumInfo.org, Consortium Standards Bulletin, Vol. V,  No. 3 (March 2006), <em>at </em><em>&lt;  http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar06.php#feature&gt; and sources cited  therein.</em></p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="23"></a>23. Standards development in consortia is a  surprisingly lean enterprise.&nbsp; The vast  majority of the successful consortia with which I have worked have had budgets  of well under $1 million a year, and large budgets have not correlated highly  with success, in comparison to factors such as member commitment and the  existence of a non-participating incumbent(s).</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="24"></a>24. An exception to this statement relates to  IPR.&nbsp; Some companies require (or at  least try to require) that no SSO membership may be entered into until the  legal department has had an opportunity to evaluate the IPR policy of the SSO  in question to determine whether it might provide unwanted opportunities to  commit IPR without proper prior review.&nbsp;&nbsp;  On one occasion when I have asked a standards director why her  department has not sought to further institutionalize the process, I received  the interesting response that it might make the full costs of standards  participation more visible, and therefore more susceptible to budget cuts.</p>

              <p class="style2">Oracle's announcement yesterday of its &quot;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2006_oct/oracle-linux-program.html?rssid=rss_ocom_pr">Unbreakable Linux 2.0</a>&quot;  program, aimed squarely at Red Hat, understandably overshadowed another  announcement Larry Ellison made in the same speech. The fact that Oracle will  provide cut-rate support for Red Hat Linux is of course big news, and if you  have any doubt that Oracle thinks so, too, check out Oracle's <a href="http://www.oracle.com/index.html">home  page</a> today , which is entirely dedicated to its Linux news (even  featuring the commanding presence of a body-armored penguin with clear  steroids-abuse issues). You'll also find an audio link to Ellison's speech  there, and if you check out the Oracle <a href="http://pressroom.oracle.com/">News page</a>, you'll see that Oracle  issued a total of 8 press releases yesterday as part of its media blitz. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Naturally, you'll be able to find reams of news, prognostications  and punditry on the Linux announcement all over the Web, so I'll focus my  attention today on the press release that I find to be most interesting: the  one that tracks Ellison's announcement in the same speech that Oracle has  joined the <a href="http://www.freestandards.org/en/Main_Page">Free Standards Group</a> (FSG), at the  highest level of membership. You can find that press release <a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2006_oct/oracle-fsg.html?rssid=rss_ocom_pr">here</a>. (Disclosure: FSG is a client  of mine, and I'm also on its Board of Directors.)</p>
              <p class="style2">                Why the FSG announcement is important has to do with why the FSG  is important. You can begin to get a handle on that reality from the squib in  the press release that summarizes what the FSG is all about:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                The Free Standards Group is the  standardization and certification authority for Linux. Without a commonly  adopted standard, Linux could fragment, proving costly for ISVs to port their  applications to the operating system and making it difficult for end users and  Linux vendors alike. With the LSB, all parties - distribution vendors, ISVs and  end users - benefit as it becomes easier and less costly for software vendors  to target Linux, resulting in more applications available for the Linux  platform. All major Linux commercial and community organizations support the  Free Standards Group.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                Stated  even more simply, the FSG is an essential component of the Linux ecosystem.  Without such a conscious and well-supported effort to keep Linux cohesive, it  could fly apart. With the FSG, dynamism, creative evolution, multiplying  distros and end-user freedom can continue to flourish.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Of course, the press release also includes the traditional  complementary quotes from both parties, which are intended to place the  announcement in context for each party. The Oracle quote, from Donald Deutsch,  Oracle's Vice President, Standards Strategy and Architecture, reads as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                Linux is a strategic platform for Oracle.  Because of that, we felt it's important that we extend our commitment to  standards-based computing and join the standardization authority for the Linux  community: the Free Standards Group. Their Linux Standard Base is an ideal  forum to collaborate with the greater Linux ecosystem on important issues for  our customer base. We look forward to working with the FSG and its member  companies to continue to drive the adoption of Linux as a solution for our  enterprise customers. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                I know Don well. He's a long-term standards professional who knows  his stuff, and should ensure that Oracle's participation in the FSG is  productive for both sides.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Jim Zemlin, FSG's Executive Director, responds in kind like this:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                As the largest enterprise software  company, Oracle is one of the most influential and important Linux software  vendors. By joining the FSG they send a clear message that they support open  standards. Their joining the FSG is a watershed moment for the Linux platform,  showing that all major Linux software vendors have joined together to support  the LSB and keep Linux from fragmenting. Their participation in our workgroup  will help us meet the most pressing needs for Linux users and developers.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                The fact that Oracle is joining the FSG &ndash; and at the highest level  - at the same time that it announces its new commercial initiative is  significant in that it publicly demonstrates Oracle's commitment to work with,  rather than against, the Linux community. By both economically as well as  technically supporting FSG, Oracle is helping further the cause of keeping  Linux both technically strong and vendor-independent. </p>
              <p class="style2">                At another level, the FSG is notable for being in the vanguard of  the evolving effort to mesh open standards with open source &ndash; two methodologies  that need each other but present interoperability issues of their own. For  example, standards are based on agreeing to do certain things the same way  every time, while a fundamental value of open source is to have the freedom to  change anything, any time. </p>
              <p class="style2">                If you're curious about how FSG has solved that conundrum, you  might find this detailed overview of FSG and interview with Jim Zemlin from  earlier this year interesting: <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/may06.php#feature">The Free Standards Group: Squaring the Open  Source/Open Standards Circle</a>.

                <p><span class="style56"><em>#43 </em></span><strong class="style38"><em>The Wikipedia and the Death of Archaeology</em></strong></p>
                <p class="style2">For  more than 200 years, moderns have sought to divine the life stories of the  ancients through the practice of archaeology.&nbsp;  Through such efforts, we can learn something about the quotidian  existence of not only those prehistorians that left no written descriptions of  their daily lives at all, but also of our more recent forebears, who rarely saw  fit to tell us what they ate for breakfast or which penny dreadfuls and  broadsheets they liked to read.</p>
                <p class="style2"> Of  course, archaeology permits us at best to see through a glass very darkly.&nbsp; Not only are we limited by the vagaries of  what has survived through fortuitous chance, but by the fact that few materials  used in daily life are designed for long-term survival under harsh  conditions.&nbsp; As a result, not much has  been consistently preserved from before the last millennia other than a limited  number of works of art, personal adornment and literature.&nbsp; For more, we must grub around in the ruins  of palaces and hovels to see what has survived the unforgiving embrace of dirt,  or search about in the more preserving, chilly waters of the deep sea.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2"> Hence,  the farther back we look into the past, the less we are likely to find, and the  more limited will be the types of artifacts we can hope to find.&nbsp; For a few hundred years of history, we may  discover glass and metal, crockery and bones,&nbsp;  and (particularly in arid regions), scraps of basketry and fabrics, as  well as seeds, pollens and bones.&nbsp; But  soon enough there are only bones and stones, and finally only enigmatic stone  flakes and tools &ndash; not much from which to intuit how a people lived, what they  knew, and how they understood themselves, their gods and the world around them.</p>
                <p class="style2"> But  surely we must know all we need to know about the post-Gutenberg era?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, not really, as so little that may be  of interest in the future seems to have much value in the moment to those that  own it (the contents of your garbage can as you read this, for example).&nbsp; How great the gap can be between those two  perceptions can be demonstrated by the archaeology projects that are ongoing at  any point in time.&nbsp; Those projects  include simple explorations of the contents of privies that stood in the  backyards of colonial Boston, and far more ambitious efforts to investigate,  and even raise, ships from the last century.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  If  such is the case, certainly there must be some better way to preserve the  reality of everyday existence, thereby avoiding the necessity to use trowels  and screens, laboratory analysis and intuition to recreate what has so recently  been real?</p>
                <p class="style2"> In  fact, there is.&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    Consider  this:&nbsp; Given a sufficient amount of  server space and the commitment to maintain it, a resource already exists that  may represent, for almost all purposes, not only the death of archaeology, but  also the opportunity to enable a greater depth and sophistication of  anthropology than has ever before existed.&nbsp;  So radical an innovation would this new anthropological methodology  represent that it deserves its own name.&nbsp; </p>

                <p class="style2"> Is the Wikipedia sufficiently comprehensive to replace the  tangible record of the past as a subject of study?&nbsp; According to the Wikipedia's description of itself as of 18:14  UST on October 29, 2006 (the entry was last updated at 15:18 UST today), the  Wikipedia currently hosts more than 5  million articles in many languages (over 1.4 million in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia" title="English Wikipedia">English-language  version</a>).&nbsp; In all, there are 229  language editions,&nbsp; sixteen of which  already have more than 50,000 articles each.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2"> But,  you may ask next, is the Wikipedia accurate enough?&nbsp; After all, there is an ongoing controversy over whether its  accuracy is the equal of a traditional encyclopedia.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2"> That  question, I think, is entirely misses the point, because I believe that the  real significance of the Wikipedia is not its status as a compendium of  information, but rather its ability to provide a record of how we see  ourselves, our heritage, our current events and our culture in real-time as  those perceptions evolve.&nbsp; And that  significance clearly transcends the utility of the shelf-bound reference works  traditionally described as encyclopedias.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">                  I  would encourage you to consider this definition of the Wikipedia, which is how  I think of it:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"><em>The Wikipedia is the most detailed,  comprehensive, concise, culturally-sensitive record of how humanity understands  itself at any precise moment in time</em></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2"> Viewed in this light, when the Wikipedia is  &quot;inaccurate&quot; due to bias or limited understanding rather than simple  error, it becomes more interesting <em>because</em> it is inaccurate.&nbsp; Looked at from this perspective, the word  &quot;inaccurate&quot; turns inside out, because the Wikipedia is being used to  determine <em>how</em> we see the world, and not whether that view is  &quot;accurate&quot; in any empirical sense.&nbsp;  In fact, in this light the more accurate an entry is, the less useful it  becomes.&nbsp; And, of course, what those  that contribute to a given entry have found to be worth including is most  interesting of all. </p>
                <p class="style2">Moreover, since the Wikipedia exists in many non-identical,  language-based independent editions, each of which is constantly changing, all  of the editions taken together provide a real-time record of not only how our  perception of ourselves morphs over time, but how that perception differs  culturally around the world as well. </p>
                <p class="style2">                  Let's conduct a simple test to determine what the  Wikipedia would tell a future Wikipediologist in a few moments, as compared to  what a tradtional archaeologist could learn from significantly greater labor.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  We'll use this <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/boston/index.html">brief account</a> of the contents of Katherine Nanny's late 17th centry privy in what  is now downtown Boston.&nbsp; That account  provides no end of interesting guesses about the life of Ms. Nanny, an  evidently feisty personage who divorced her husband in 1671, accusing him of  (among other bad acts) &quot;whoredomes,&quot;  and &quot;abuses of the marriage bed.&quot;&nbsp;  For example, do the scraps of fine material indicate that Katherine dumped her husband's clothes down the chute  rather than send them to faithless husband when he requested them, after  abscondingn with the pregnat servant girl?&nbsp;  Or perhaps that she simply made the family's clothes?&nbsp; That there were well to do, or that she was  as seamstress for the well-to-do?</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Or what of this?</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style2"> Most intriguing of all were 250,000  seeds and pits from fruits, nuts, and spices, analyzed by Lawrence Kaplan and  Marie Mansfield King of the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Cherry and  plum pits made up 95 percent of the total, far more than any normal household  would consume. Was Nanny making brandied cherries, or a steeped alcoholic drink  called cherry bounce? &quot;It looks like she was making preserves,&quot; says  state archaeologist Brona Simon. &quot;I think it was her business, a cottage  industry.&quot; &quot;There had to be something going on,&quot; Bob Hasenstab  agrees, speculating that granary weevils, pollen, spoiled flour, and cherry  pits meant Nanny was baking cherry pies. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                  Intriguing though these guesses may be (or not,  depending on how much you care to obssess about granary weevils), merely  guesses they must remain.</p>
                <p class="style2"> Note also that analyses such as these obscure the  true purpose of archaeology to begin with, which is not to determine how  Katherine Nanny in particular spent her free time towards the end of the 1600s,  but what life was like in general in Boston at the same time.&nbsp; And the contents of one privy, no matter how  interesting, do not a cultural portrait of an entire people make.</p>
                <p class="style2"> Now let's consult the Wikipedia to see how it would  compare, using a Wikipedia definition of an archaeological artifact commonly  found from the same period, one that, as is typical, can offer at most only a  few enigmatic clues to its discoverer:&nbsp;  the spoon.&nbsp; Likely enough Nanny's  three-holer (a commodius facility, to be sure) must have yielded at least one  spoon, which could have been interesting from its style, composition (silver or  pewter) and maker's mark, if any.&nbsp; But  beyond that &ndash; not much.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">In contrast, consider the following extracts from  the Wikipedia <a href="http://www.thegate.ca/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=10">entry</a> on this humble implement</p>
                <blockquote>

                  <p class="style2"><span class="style2">                  As of the 1940s, a combination utensil of spoon and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork" title="Fork">fork</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spork" title="Spork">spork</a>, has been in  use.

                <p class="style2">                  But there is also far  more in this single entry, weaving together idioms, everyday practices, and  much more, encapsulating within a single Webpage a snapshot of early 21st  century life that incorporates details otherwise doomed to disappear beyond the  horizon of time sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Such as the following  sampling: </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li class="style2">In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary" title="Culinary">culinary</a> world, a &quot;spoon&quot; is a restaurant owned and opened by a notable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef" title="Chef">chef</a> who sets the       restaurant's overall tone and menu, but who largely leaves the day-to-day       management to others while the chef operates one or more principal (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_cuisine" title="Haute cuisine">haute       cuisine</a>) restaurants. Spoons are less expensive, but offer many       recipes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_end" title="High end">high end</a> restaurant.<a href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072512431/student_view0/chapter22/business_week_article.html" title="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072512431/student_view0/chapter22/business_week_article.html">[1]</a> </li>

                  <li class="style2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_spoon" title="Wooden spoon">Wooden       spoon</a> is a phrase used to describe the &quot;achievement&quot; of a       team or individual in finishing last in a contest, a wooden spoon being a       common and almost valueless object, in stark contrast to the contest       winners who will often receive a trophy made of silver or similar precious       metal. The term originates from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University" title="Cambridge University">Cambridge University</a>, wherein professors       used to dangle a wooden spoon humiliatingly before students who had failed       their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripos" title="Tripos">tripos</a>. </li>

                <p class="style2"> I personally believe that the Wikipedia is too  important a cultural resource to risk losing, and would propose that Google  partner with the Wikipedia to archive and maintain the entire Wikipedia at some  regular interval - not less than annually &ndash; and make these copies available to  the public indefinitely.&nbsp; Being able to  compare how a given entry changes over time, and how entries on the same topic  in different languages compare at the same time, could offer a depth of  understanding and study undreamed of in the history of the world.</p>

                        <p class="style2"> After all, I think not.&nbsp; One need only look once again to the Wikipedia entry on the  humble spoon, and find reassurance in an external link to &quot;The Spoon  Project.&quot;&nbsp; The description of the  link explains that The Spoon Project presents a &quot;Gallery of people with spoons on  their noses.&quot;</p>
                      <p class="style2"> Perhaps the significance of this creative endeavor  will be instantly comprehensible to future Wikipediologists, who will  immediately place it into its proper socio-economic and political context.&nbsp; </p>
