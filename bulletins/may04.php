                <p align="left"> <span class="style2">Government and standard setting coexist in the United States in a uniquely American way. Contrary to the practice in most countries, the development of standards in the U.S. is almost entirely a matter of private, rather than public, action. Even the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), which accredits American standards development organizations (SDOs) and represents the United States in ISO, the global standards body, is a non-governmental entity. </span></p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> While this reality is wholly consistent with the American ethos of private enterprise, it also creates a need for close cooperation and effective communication between standard setting organizations (or SSOs, meaning both SDOs and consortia) and government. Why? Because there are some things that only governments can do, such as negotiating trade treaties with the governments of other sovereign states. As a result, SSOs sometimes need to recruit federal clout in support of commercial interests. And from government&rsquo;s perspective, standards have become so vital to global trade that government cannot secure some advantages for Americans without the active assistance of SSOs. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> The importance of standards and the need for effective cooperation between the private standard setting sector and government is highlighted by two events that occurred in recent weeks. The first was the resolution of a much-watched standards face-off between China and U.S. chip manufacturers. (See our <strong><em>Trends</em></strong> article for this month: <strong><em><a href="#trends">Breaking Down Trade Barriers: Avoiding the China Syndrome</a></em></strong>). A compromise was reached between the two countries at the eleventh hour through intervention at the highest levels of government. The second was the release of a major report by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), entitled &ldquo;Standards and Competitiveness &ndash; Coordinating for Results.&rdquo; (See our <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong> this month, <strong><em><a href="#feature">U.S. Department of Commerce Releases a Major Standards Report</a></em></strong>) </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> In the case of the China standoff, Intel and other companies had announced their decision to discontinue shipments to China rather than comply with a Chinese government edict that would require all wireless-enabled products to meet its own home-grown wireless standard, beginning June 1. The edict went far beyond merely mandating a local standard over the globally popular IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard, however. It also provided that a limited number of Chinese manufacturers would be licensed to build and certify to the Chinese standard. Hence, any foreign manufacturer would not only need to comply with the new standard, but partner with a Chinese company as well. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> Following lobbying by American industry representatives, a letter was sent to Chinese Vice Premiers Wu Yi and Zeng Peiyan that was co-signed not only by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans and U.S. Trade representative Robert Zoellick, but by Secretary of State Colin Powell as well, for added emphasis. At a meeting held on April 21 st, the Chinese finally agreed to indefinitely postpone the imposition of their standard, and to cooperate in the further development of a global standard. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> The narrow avoidance of a standards trade war with China provided an appropriate backdrop for the release of the DOC report, which had been in the works since an initiative to counter trade barriers was announced by the DOC in March of 2003. Not surprisingly, the report is subtitled, &ldquo;Removing Standards-Related Trade Barriers Through Effective Collaboration.&rdquo; </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> The findings and recommendations of the report are in large part the product of 13 wide-ranging round table discussions hosted by the DOC with representatives of over 200 industry associations and SSOs from diverse industries. During those round tables, it was made clear that industry understandably looks to government to intervene to eliminate standards-based trade barriers. The report also found that, while many effective systems and interconnections between the federal government and SSOs are already in place, there are many ways in which the situation could be improved to national advantage. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> Why would the support of standard setting by government be in need of a tune up? Perhaps it is that the vibrancy of voluntary, consensus standard setting in this country has made it easy for close cooperation between SSOs and government to be neglected. The federal government, after all, has enough to occupy its attention, while U.S. industry is always happier to self regulate than to be regulated. As a result of this dynamic, the two forces are more likely to effectively unite in a defensive posture when a threat arises, rather than to collaborate on an ongoing basis as part of a comprehensive program to optimize the competitiveness of U.S industry abroad. This can leave the U.S. at a disadvantage, when faced with the closely coordinated public/private programs that are active in countries such as China, and within alliances such as the European Union. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> The results of the relatively tenuous connection between government and the standard setting infrastructure in the United States may not be all bad. Recently, U.S. manufacturers of water heaters found themselves in a no-win situation when a Department of Energy efficiency rule became effective, but the DOE had not yet created the mandatory test called for by the new rule to prove compliance. Only by applying for a compliance waiver for their products could the manufacturers continue to sell their wares. As of this writing, the DOE is still spending its time processing requests for waivers rather than completing the test. In the meantime, the efficiency standard languishes. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> And in any event, standards should first and foremost be about ensuring qualities like utility, interoperability, safety and efficiency, and not about securing offensive or defensive advantages for national industries. In the best of all worlds (as compared to the one we actually inhabit), standards would exclusively be developed to create level playing fields, provide the best solutions for consumers, and to advance similarly laudable goals. And, in truth, the new Department of Commerce report focuses more on creating level playing fields than on substituting U.S.-advantaged standards in place of their foreign analogs. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> We believe that the United States -- as well as every other country -- has far more to gain by promoting the adoption of the best standards and the breaking down of trade barriers than by playing standards games intended to favor domestic industry. Governments already have ample tools at their disposal to advance national trade interests besides proprietary standards and unreasonable conformance assessment practices. The over arching problem, of course, is that it is just as easy to counter one trade barrier with another. Soon standards can become solely tools to defeat competition, rather than to create intrinsic value. Ultimately, universally adopted standards not only guarantee better products, but make every nation&rsquo;s goods and services more suitable and attractive in a global market as well. </p>

                <p align="left" class="style2"> As observed in the opening line of Secretary of Commerce Evans&rsquo; introduction to the DOC report, &ldquo;The international language of commerce is standards.&rdquo; When individual countries lose sight of the accuracy of that proposition, there is a risk to us all that efficient global trade may disintegrate under the imposition of a Babel of local standards. </p>

              <p align="left"> <strong><em> <span class="style10">Introduction: &nbsp;</span></em></strong><span class="style2">It is not often that a press conference on standards draws a standing room only crowd in the nation&rsquo;s capitol. But on May 18, I watched as the custodial staff of the Department of Commerce (DOC) carried chair after chair into the Main Lobby of the Department of Commerce when just that occurred. Well over 100 press and industry representatives had gathered to hear Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans issue a report outlining the DOC&rsquo;s plan to defend U.S. trade by more aggressively supporting the U.S. voluntary standards process. Evans was joined on the dais by an appropriate supporting cast of prominent representatives of industry, standard setting organizations and government agencies. </span></p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style2">The title of the DOC report: &ldquo;Standards and Competitiveness &ndash; Coordinating for Results&rdquo; was in some ways less informative than its subtitle: &ldquo;Removing Standards-Related Trade Barriers Through Effective Collaboration.&rdquo; That subtitle was aligned with the March 19, 2003 DOC press release in which the initiative leading to the release of the report was announced. The lead quote attributed to Evans in that press release reads in part as follows: </span></p>

              <blockquote>

                <p align="left"> <span class="style2">&ldquo;The Bush Administration remains committed to promoting competition and opening new markets for U.S. goods. Standards and testing are key to our international competitiveness. But more and more we are hearing that foreign standards and testing requirements are keeping our products out of foreign markets. This is the wrong approach that reduces efficiencies, limits competition and increases prices for the consumer goods.&rdquo; </span></p>

              </blockquote>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> The impetus for launching the initiative was an accumulation of events, from minor actions by individual countries to the broad-based integration of standards into commercial policy by the European Union. But the degree of attention that the release of the report commanded was likely augmented by the long buildup and timely resolution in late April of a well-publicized standards battle between China and the United States (see the following article, <strong><em><a href="#trends">Breaking Down Trade Barriers: Avoiding the China Syndrome</a></em></strong>). And certainly, the issue of global competitiveness is particularly relevant in an election year where employment growth and the preservation of manufacturing jobs are key factors. </p>

                    <li class="style2">Over 50 discrete recommendations, grouped under 11 major headings, as discussed in greater detail below. </li>

                </ul>

                <strong><em> <span class="style10">What the Report is Not</span></em></strong><span class="style10"><strong><em>:</em></strong></span> <span class="style2">While the compilation of issues in the report is convincingly comprehensive and the recommendations are thoughtful, the report does not provide any surprising revelations, or propose any bold new initiatives. Rather, it offers a mix of thematic suggestions as well as specific actions that are intended to tune up and optimize the existing trade support system. Many of the recommendations focus on increasing coordination and communication within what it rightly refers to as the &ldquo;highly decentralized&rdquo; U.S. standards system. Other recommendations are externally directed, and intended (for example) to permit U.S. government and industry to identify foreign trade barriers more quickly, and confront them more effectively. </span></div>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em> Principal Issues: </em></strong> A wide diversity of issues were identified during the information gathering phase of the DOC initiative. One way to group them, with some added observations, is as follows: </p>

              <ul>

                <li>

                  <div align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Non-Proprietary Systemic Issues:</span></em></strong> An &ldquo;overriding&rdquo; concern identified by many participants was &ldquo;the presence of multiple standards or standards differing from international norms in other countries.&rdquo; It is important to note that there are many reasons for this reality. While it is true that some countries set standards as deliberate barriers, others set standards (at least in part) for genuine local or regional perceived needs. Similarly, global standards are set through a consensual process, which by its nature is not as efficient or as coordinated as an enforceable process might be. Finally, proprietary forces at the corporate level are rife in the standard setting process, which often leads to the launching of competing standards based on purely commercial, as compared to national, agendas. Solutions &ndash; and the appropriateness of government to provide them &ndash; that are intended to limit the existence of competing standards will be very different when the causality is nationally based than when it arises from the ambitions of a group of multinational companies.</div>

                </li>

              </ul>

              <div align="left">

                <ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Proprietary Systemic Issues:</span></em></strong> International standards bodies are inherently based on the concept of one vote per country. But with the increasing incorporation of standards into European Union policy, and the expansion of the Union itself, some round table participants objected to the increasing power of bloc voting in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Any modification to such rules is arguably more properly the province for debate within ISO than the DOC. </li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em> Mechanical Barriers:</em></strong> Not only standards, but conformity assessment can be the source of abuses. Many participants highlighted the insistence of some countries not only on testing, but on testing within their own borders, even where a product may have previously been certified as compliant to a standard at another location. In contrast to the previous category, this type of barrier seems uniquely suited for government, as compared to SDO, action. </li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em> Standards of Objectivity:</em></strong> Some participants believed that certain regulations have no objective basis, and had not been determined in a transparent fashion. Of course, the objective basis for a standard or regulation is in the eye of the beholder, and some regulations (such as a number of European regulations with ecological dimensions) that seem either protectionist or baseless to some Americans appear eminently reasonable to the generally greener consciousness of &ldquo;Old Europe.&rdquo; Progress in this category again seems properly the province of government -- but the current administration has not assiduously cultivated the type of cooperative treaty relationships with Europe that would facilitate progress on this front. </li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Lack of Government Funding Support:</span></em></strong> Standard setting in the United States by SSOs is inherently a low budget proposition relative to its importance, due to the lack of direct government support for that process. The ANSI accredited standards development organizations (SDOs) are feeling particularly at economic risk, given the recent holding of a federal court in <em>Southern Building Code Congress International v. Veeck. </em>The court in that case granted a builder the right of free access to a copyrighted standard referenced in a building code, raising the prospect that federal courts nationwide might mandate free access to some percentage of the thousands of standards currently being sold to underwrite the operations of SDOs. Certainly, what would be a modest infusion of cash by government standards would be an enormous influx of capital in the primarily virtual world of standards development.</li>

                </ul>

              </div>

              <div align="left">

                <ul>

                    <li class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Lack of Government International Support:</span></em></strong> Some participants believed that the federal government could be more forceful in supporting standards at the treaty level, and, in particular, should seek to hold foreign nations more closely to U.S. interpretations of the requirements of the World Trade Organization&rsquo;s Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (WTO TBT). Other suggested actions included augmenting DOC outreach to foreign officials in an effort to educate them to treaty obligations. While government efforts could certainly be effective in this area, there should also be opportunities for direct action by American SDOs as well. </li>

                </ul>

                <strong><em> <span class="style10">The Recommendations</span></em></strong><span class="style10"><strong><em>:</em></strong></span><span class="style2"> The actions proposed in the report are the work of DOC staff members in consultation with DOC bureaus, based upon their own observations, the roundtable input, and formal submissions. The Recommendations themselves are a potpourri of activities large and small, ranging from &ldquo;Promote World Standards Week more visibly&rdquo; at the low end to the creation of a Standards Liaison post within the ITA at the more substantive end of the spectrum (the first Standards Liaison, Heidi Hijikata, has already been appointed). </span>

                <p class="style2"> A large number of recomendations involve improvement of domestic communication and coordination at specific points of contact, as well as particular types of information that should pass between stated committees, bureaus, SDOs and industry participants. Other coommunication recommendations are more generalized (e.g., &ldquo;Develop and promote consistent messages within DOC and the U.S., Government on key standards issues&hellip;&rdquo;). This is hardly surprising, and no doubt necessary in so decentralized a system. </p>

                <p class="style2"> Another large number of recommendations do not propose any new specific actions at all, and instead simply urging &ldquo;expanding,&rdquo; &ldquo;building upon&rdquo; and &ldquo;continuing&rdquo; existing programs. And the language used in certain specific recommendations indicates a degree of ambivilence that undercuts hopes for prompt action. </p>

                <p class="style2"> Some of the more interesting recommendations include the following: </p>

                <ul>

                  <li> <span class="style2">&ldquo;Explore opportunities&rdquo; to create a public/private task force to augment a DOC effort to identify and resolve standards-related barriers to trade as quickly as possible. Such an effort would &ldquo;include extensive collaboration with other agencies, such as the U.S. Trade Representative.&rdquo; The tentative language of this recommendation, however, raises questions over the DOC&rsquo;s commitment towards effective implementation. (Recommendation V.1.a) </span></li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li> <span class="style2">&ldquo;Organize a high-level Standards Trade Mission&hellip;probably to China or Europe, focusing on Promotion of U.S. Approach to standards and strengths of U.S. system for a specific sector.&rdquo; Such a mission would include representatives of SDOs as well as industry. The use of the words &ldquo;probably/or&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;and&rdquo; (without the &ldquo;probably&rdquo;) again indicates tentativeness. (Recommendation V.1.e) </span></li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li> <span class="style2">&ldquo;Provide basic training on standards and conformity assessment, including testing, labeling, accreditation, and related issues&hellip;&rdquo; to a wide variety of domestic and overseas trade staff. To the credit of the DOC, Evans announced at the press conference that this effort is already well under way. (Recommendation V.3.a) </span></li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li class="style2"> Intriguingly: &ldquo;Formalize training on standards development, conformity assessment, relevant trade agreements, and interagency process to DOC staff (spcifically NIST, NTIA and ITA).&rdquo; Given that these are the agencies that are most concerned with standards, such training would seem overdue &ndash; but better late than never. (Recommendation V.3.b) </li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li class="style2"> By seeking collaboration and funding opportunities with a diversity of other agencies and programs, including the Commercial Law Development Program (CDLP), the Middle east Partnership Initiative (MEPI)(State Department) grants, the Trade Development Agency (TDA), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and private-sector sources. (Recommendation V.4.b) </li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li> <span class="style2">&ldquo;Collaborate with ANSI on the revision of the National Standards Strategy&rdquo; (the NSS was originally created by ANSI in 2000). (Recommendation V.4.d) </span></li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li> <span class="style2">&ldquo;Evaluate early warning systems used by other U.S. Government agencies, specifically USDA&rsquo;s tiered early warning system.&rdquo; (Recommendation 5.c) </span></li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li> <span class="style2">&ldquo;Improve Interactions with China.&rdquo; Given that one out of five people alive today lives in China and the fact that China has been increasingly focusing on domestic standards in preference to international standards, it may not be surprising that China rates an entire category of the report to itself, with nine different recommendations. Most of the recommendations, however, are general rather than specific, and begin with words such as &ldquo;Support,&rdquo; &ldquo;Continue to monitor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Explore.&rdquo; The closest that any of the nine recommendations comes to launching a specific new activity is the last: &ldquo;Periodically assess how Chinese standards development and new standards affect U.S. exports and market access to key industry sectors.&rdquo; (Recommendation V.7.i)</span></li>

                </ul>

              </div>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10"> <strong><em> Conclusions</em></strong>:</span></em></strong> <span class="style2">The DOC report is hardly a bold, visionary document. No significant new programs are proposed, and many of the recommendations relate to existing programs. But on the other hand, the DOC has already begun to actively implement the plan, with several of the more important recommendations already completed (e.g., the appointment of the first Standards Liaison) or well underway (such as the training of its overseas personnel on standards matters). And, in fact, there is little apparent need for the type of dramatic new initiatives that might play well in an election year but would have little practical purpose. </span></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Instead, the report focuses on the very signficant forces already in place within the DOC and elsewhere inside the government. If this vast infrastructure is truly trained, optimized and deployed in support of a coherent standards policy, then the effects could be significant indeed. We have just seen the Bush administration engage with China at a high diplomatic level to break down an imminent standards barrier, so clearly the government is already aware of the stakes at issue when standards are used to close markets. And Phil Bond, the Under Secretary for Technology in the DOC, is not only clearly knowledgeable and engaged when it comes to standards, but also willing to project an active presence in SDO and consortium venues as proof that he recognizes the importance of standards to the national interest. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> At the same time, it does not appear that there will be any fundamental shift in the relationship between the voluntary standard setting process in the United States and government. No mention is made of any direct funding for standard setting. Nor is there any proposal for any more formal structural change in the way that SSOs and government interact. Such a proposal might, for example, have involved holding an annual &ldquo;summit&rdquo; between representatives of SSOs and of the appropriate agencies and bureaus of government. Granting standards such a level of respect and attention might help preserve the degree of attention that they are enjoying under the report. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Whether the absence of structural change is for the better or worse in other respects, it does mean that the new commitment of government to support standard setting is more likely to wane rather than wax, once the threat of foreign, standards-based trade barriers eventually abates. For that reason, at least, its disappointing that the report did not take a bolder course. </p>

              </blockquote>

              <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Background</span><span class="style2">:</span></em></strong><span class="style2"> One of the less stressful tasks that United States Secretary of State Colin Powell performed this March was to co-sign a letter addressed to Chinese Vice Premiers Wu Yi and Zeng Peiyan, protesting the imminent effectiveness of a Chinese technology standard. That standard would have prevented non-Chinese manufacturers from selling wireless-enabled devices in China unless they could secure the assistance of one of 24 Chinese companies that were licensed to utilize the new standard. </span></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> It&rsquo;s not often these days that Colin Powell takes time off from America&rsquo;s current international troubles to take an active part in a trade matter. But in this case, the potential stakes were huge, extending far beyond the commercial fortunes of U.S. chip vendors. Over 1.2 billion people live in China, and allowing the governmental gatekeepers of so vast a market to successfully erect a standards barrier would bode ill for U.S. trade not only during election year, but for long thereafter. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Moreover, China&rsquo;s action on the standard in question did not represent an isolated incident. Significantly, a 2004 General Accounting Office survey of U.S. companies with a presence in China ranked &ldquo;standards and certification&rdquo; as the most serious issue on an extensive list of World Trade Organization (WTO) commitment areas, ranking above even &ldquo;tariffs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; -- despite extortionate value added taxes on some goods and the rampant piracy of intellectual property in China that together result in the payment and loss of billions of dollars a year. Equally significant, standards and certification issues had ranked number 20 in a similar survey conducted only two years before. Clearly, there had been a policy shift in Beijing that required responsive action. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> The standard at issue is known as WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure, or WAPI, which is analogous in purpose to the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Fidelity (or Wi-Fi) standard. China&rsquo;s public objection to the IEEE offering involves the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security component of Wi-Fi, which China&rsquo;s Ministry of Information Industries pronounced last November to be inadequate. Due to this failing, only WAPI, a new standard approved by the Chinese Standardization Administration of China (SAC) was deemed to be adequate to enable wireless capability in products sold in China. WAPI was declared to be effective on December 1 of 2003, but the deadline for mandatory compliance was deferred to June 1, 2004. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> If China was simply concerned about the adequacy of WEP, international businesses immediately pointed out, it could have addressed its concerns in a variety of traditional ways. Already, efforts at IEEE were at work to bolster Wi-Fi security, and China could have participated in those efforts. Or, it could have proposed its own standard for international adoption and use, or at least made it generally available for implementation. Instead, China not only mandated compliance with its domestic standard, but also refused to license the underlying technology to anyone but a select group of domestic companies. Foreign manufacturers could seek, but would not be guaranteed, a partner for purposes of offering their products to the Chinese marketplace. Moreover, western semiconductor manufacturers were concerned over the need to share their most valued design information with commercial partners in a nation renowned for loose respect for intellectual property rights, and non-existent government enforcement of those same rights. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> In the months between the announcement of the WAPI standard and the letter signed by Secretary Powell (as well as by Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick), opposition on the part of U.S. companies mounted dramatically. Notably, Intel, Texas Instruments and Broadcom each announced that it would not sell affected products in China after May 31. Intel CEO Craig Barrett visited Beijing in early April as part of a continuing dialogue with Chinese trade officials in an effort to resolve the standoff. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">The Stakes</span>: </em></strong> After decades of comparative second tier status, the Chinese economy is now assuming enormous trade power, not only as an exporter, but as a potential importer as well. It is now the third largest trade partner for the United States, and its economy is growing at a far greater pace than that of any western nation. At the same time, it has an extremely cheap work force, a historically inward looking world view, and the type of state control that permits tight control of imports, if it chooses to exercise it. Finally, China now permits a sufficient degree of freedom to individuals to inspire the type of entrepreneurship that enables quick response to commercial opportunities as they arise. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> There is great temptation for the government of China to exercise its central control by erecting a variety of trade barriers. Already, China imposes a punitive 17% value added tax on imported semiconductors &ndash; but rebates all but 3% of that tax when it is paid by a domestic manufacturer. In 2003, China imported over $2 billion in semiconductors, resulting in payments by U.S. manufacturers of $344 million in VAT charges. In March of this year, the United States filed its first fair-treatment complaint against China with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the VAT issue. A hearing date on the complaint has not yet been announced. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> The U.S. is ill-positioned to see trade shift further to the benefit of China. Already, the U.S. is running trade deficits at an all time high level ($124 billion of which was attributable to China alone in 2003), and manufacturing jobs continue to be siphoned off to low-wage markets in Asia. At the same time, China lacks an extensive network of land lines, and is the fastest-growing wireless market in the world. Until now, however, it has imported 85% of the semiconductors that it uses to enable wireless devices. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Thus, the wireless market represents, on the one hand, an opportunity to narrow the trade deficit between the U.S. and China. And on the other hand, it represents the potential for another dramatic loss of U.S. jobs, if China uses protective measures to help its domestic companies acquire the potential to compete both at home and abroad. The possibility of the latter alternative coming true, with or without protective measures, is real: Taiwanese companies, which already are heavily involved in setting up manufacturing facilities in China, grew their own semiconductor sales from $440 million in 1990 to $16 billion only ten years later, according to figures compiled by McKinsey. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> The WAPI standoff was thus one that the U.S. could ill-afford to ignore. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">The Resolution:</span></em></strong> At the same time, any single issue that is addressed between the governments of two countries can only be addressed in the context of all other current and long-term issues that concern those governments. In the case of global powers like the U.S. and mainland China, those issues include a complex web of ideological, human rights and geo-political topics, in addition to a host of trade matters. And dynamically, any negotiation involves not only the issue at hand, but also the avoidance of looking weak. Still, once the lines were drawn and the two parties were staring at each other across the conference room table, either China or the U.S needed to blink in order for the issue to be resolved. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Fortunately for the United States, it was China that blinked. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> The setting was the 15 th session of the China-US Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, an annual event held this year in Washington, D.C. Vice Premier Wu Yi led a 17 member delegation to that meeting, and announced China&rsquo;s decision on April 21 to back down after a day of intense negotiations. He also announced a willingness to crack down on intellectual property piracy. Specifically, China agreed to indefinitely postpone required compliance with WAPI, and announced its willingness to work with international standard setting organizations in an effort to agree upon a global 3G wireless standard. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> As part of the accord announced, the Standards Administration of China will now work with the IEEE on further development of broadband standards, as well as continue to advance the WAPI standard. The IEEE, which is already seeking to beef up the security features of the Wi-Fi standard through inclusion of the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in the 802.11i version of Wi-Fi, for its part has agreed to hold a meeting of its wireless working group in China. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> But did China, in fact, blink in response to U.S. governmental pressure? </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> In the case of the accord reached in April, it is important to note not only what was agreed to, but what was left in dispute, and what may have transpired between closed doors that was not publicly disclosed. True, the WAPI standard was indefinitely shelved by China, but the VAT tax remains in place. The U.S., of course, will have a second chance to make progress on that score when the WTO schedules a hearing on that issue. In the meantime, of course, China&rsquo;s nascent semiconductor business will enjoy a pronounced price advantage, and U.S. semiconductor companies will continue to line the coffers of the Chinese government. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> It is also worth noting that China itself was not in good field position to stick to its own deadline, if Intel and other manufacturers were indeed determined to stick by their guns. China has a true need and commitment to wireless deployment, and it already has a significant installed base of Intel Centrino-based equipment &ndash; all using the Wi-Fi standard if they have wireless capability. With its own deadline only six weeks away, China may have come to view the biggest potential loser of its own policy (at least in the near term) as itself. Ultimately, it may have been the U.S. semiconductor vendors that asserted the most persuasive pressure. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em> <span class="style10">Conclusions:</span></em></strong> From the standards perspective, the most significant aspect of the Wi-Fi/WAPI affair is that a &ldquo;standards war&rdquo; was averted. There are already sufficient barriers to trade, and indeed, enough standards-based impediments in place already, without providing the basis for escalation. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> When a situation as closely followed as this is resolved in favor of seeking a single global standard, the international standards infrastructure becomes stronger. Had the standoff ended with China sticking by its guns after the United States had engaged at the highest diplomatic levels, there would have been the potential for the U.S. to respond in like kind, or for other nations to more seriously consider erecting similar protective measures, given the failure of the U.S. to turn China&rsquo;s flank. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> It is to be hoped that the WAPI episode will mark the beginning of a retreat from using standards as barriers to trade, rather than an augury of similar actions to come by China or other nations or alliances. In the end, the best hope for businesses and consumers everywhere lies in the realization by those setting trade policy that all have more to gain than to lose by supporting strong, universally adopted standards. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style42">[] [] May 17, 2004 </p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style55"><font size="3"><strong class="style56"><em>#16</em></strong><em class="style38"><strong><strong><em> </em></strong></strong></em></font></span><span class="style7"><em class="style38"><strong><strong><em>RMBS and (Another) Dark Side of the Internet &nbsp;</em></strong></strong></em></span><span class="style2">Not long ago, I looked in on a few of the many right-wing conspiracy sites on the Web - the kind maintained by folks that are convinced that the government is hiding under the bed and lurking behind every street corner. My visit was occasioned by the announcement at some of these sites that the government had supposedly contaminated the money supply with RFID tags, the better to track us by. </span></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> Today I invite you to journey with me into another dark corner of the Web - the Yahoo!/Finance message board where certain committed Rambus stockholders meet. Rambus, as regular visitors to this site are aware, is the company that has been accused of &quot;gaming&quot; the JEDEC standard setting process in order to extract billions of dollars of royalties from the semiconductor industry. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> One would expect that those that gather at the Yahoo! Rambus message board would visit to offer information and opinions on where Rambus stock prices may head next. The following recent post provides a sample of the type of erudite financial analysis exchanged at this venue: </p>

              <p align="center" class="style2"><em> DID JERRY THE FRUITCAKE FIGURE OUT WHO BONED HIM WITH THE FBI YET? </em></p>

              <div align="left" class="style2">

                <p> Indeed. Regrettably, we do not learn who it was that boned Jerry the Fruitcake, but presumably the deed must have had a significant impact on the quarterly earnings of Rambus to warrant mention. </p>

                <p> At this point, you will be wondering why I am writing about Rambus message boards (or, more precisely, RMBS boards - RMBS being the company's trading symbol). The reason is that those who hang out on the RMBS boards regularly send me their thoughts on an unsolicited basis. Given their generosity in this regard, I thought that I should return the favor by sharing their wisdom with a wider audience. </p>

                <p> I first learned that I was acquiring a loyal following at the Yahoo! (and other) Rambus boards after I had the temerity to file our first pro bono brief in the case of Rambus v. Infineon, the case among several involving Rambus that is the farthest advanced in the courts. &quot;Pro bono,&rdquo; of course, means that we filed the brief without charge to anyone, and paid all of the filing and printing costs as well. Our brief urged that the Federal Circuit Court, to which Rambus had appealed its case after losing in a trial court, should reconsider its decision not to sanction Rambus for its bad behavior in the JEDEC standard setting process. </p>

                <p> In the trial court proceeding, it had been established that Rambus had destroyed evidence, and discovery also showed that Rambus had sought to covertly violate the JEDEC disclosure rules. A judge and jury agreed and severely sanctioned Rambus, but two out of three judges on a Federal Circuit Court panel later disregarded many of the jury's findings of fact, and imposed a patent analysis that many believe is wholly inappropriate to standard setting. The third judge on the panel roundly condemned Rambus for its conduct, and stated that the patent analysis used by the court was flawed and impractical as applied to the standard setting process. </p>

                <p> One would assume that filing a brief protesting the failure of the Federal Circuit to punish deliberate bad behavior in standard setting would be a pretty wholesome, &quot;motherhood, America and apple pie&quot; type of activity. However, in the eyes of certain individuals who spend their lives banging the message boards, one would assume wrong. Immediately upon filing the brief, I began receiving email with messages such as this: </p>

                <blockquote>

                  <p> <em>Please quit writing LIES! IF you stick to the FACTS RMBS is the one who got screwed here, not the other way around. JEDEC DID NOT INVENT ANYTHING! THEY STOLE RMBS IP AND CALLED IT SDRAM. END OF STORY!!! THE 703 disclosed most of the working elements of SDRAM and DDR. Please name ONE thing that JEDEC ever invented? </em></p>

                </blockquote>

                <p> Indeed, it is true. JEDEC has never invented anything, nor was it formed to do so. It sets standards, based upon the contributions of its members. But if one uses enough capital letters, things surely must become correct (even if they still make no sense). </p>

                <p> A recurring theme of my faithful correspondents is their conviction that no one ever does anything, except for personal gain. For example, this especially articulate RMBS stockholder knows, as almost all of my friends at the RMBS boards do, that I am obviously lying when I state that our three briefs (Federal Circuit, Supreme Court and FTC) were filed on a pro bono basis: </p>

                <blockquote>

                  <p> <em>You on the take like Judge Payne I take it..Probably got a lot of &quot;free&quot; money for working out this article. Nobody works for free. ALJ Mguire seen through it, the circuit court seen through it and now we all see through it....I will pass on your name to be investigated for receiving funds from the 8,600 companies for fraudently mis representing this article being written for no fee! </em></p>

                </blockquote>

                <p> Others, of course, are more brief and to the point, offering only a single sentence email in order to launch a mature debate on the issues: </p>

                <blockquote>

                  <p> <em>Lying asshole, put down the crack pipe my son. </em></p>

                </blockquote>

                <p> I'm told that there is much hilarity at the boards over the fact that Rambus has been doing rather well in the courts of late. Recently, I received a T shirt from my friends at the RMBS boards, inscribed &quot;Can you even Read ?&quot; The question is curious, given that if its underlying premise is true, then there is no point in asking. The label on the envelope in which the T shirt arrived includes the slogan &quot;All Roads lead to Rambus!,&rdquo; which is also curious, given that this opinion is shared by the Complaint Counsel at the FTC, as well as the judge and the jury in the District Court, which heard the most exhaustive testimony in the case, and handed RMBS its figurative head. </p>

                <p> My pen pals also delight in posting their emails to me at the RMBS boards, to show each other how very witty they are. </p>

                <p> At the same time, the RMBS crew can't stay away from the ConsortiumInfo.org site. Why? Because they live for information about the stock, and know that sometimes they can learn things first at ConsortiumInfo.org. A very sad quandary for a poor day trader to find herself in, having to visit the devil to get her fix. But hey, thanks for the site traffic! </p>

                <p> So where does all this lead? To the observation that while there are many investors who use message boards for completely legitimate purposes, there are others who gather there to yammer and trade profanity over, essentially, nothing. The same thing occurs in countless boards, on countless subjects -- political, social, and so on -- all over the Internet. It&rsquo;s sad that a technology that can share so much knowledge is also so often used to help pools of dysfunctional people clump together to ignore any information that doesn't match their financial self-interest, to abuse anyone who may disagree with their views, to assume that no one acts except for personal gain, and to stoke each other's prejudices. </p>

                <p> Clearly, there is a need on the Internet for more types of standards (the old-fashioned types, like decency and respect) than just technical ones. But, after all, there is a recognized need today for adult daycare, and it may well be safer to have the crazies tied to their computers than loose on the streets. </p>

                <p> But enough of this - <em>I've got mail ! </em></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong> TIA Press Release, Arlington, VA, May 5, 2004 --</strong> The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) applauds the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) effort to expand the availability of broadband technology in rural areas. USDA announced yesterday the approval of 20 rural broadband and telecommunications loans totaling $190 million to expand access to advanced technology in 19 states. Of the $190 million announced yesterday, $150 million resulted from funding available through the 2002 Farm Bill. The remaining $40 million in loans came from Rural Development's traditional program under which borrowers are required to ensure that all infrastructure built include broadband capability. The announcement supports President Bush's recent commitment to promoting innovation and economic security through broadband deployment. In two speeches, March 26 and April 26, Bush outlined a foundation for a national broadband strategy and ensured that every household in America will have access to broadband by the year 2007. ...<a href="http://www.tiaonline.org/media/press_releases/index.cfm?parelease=04-66" target="_off">Full Story </a></p>

CAP enables the exchange of emergency alert and public warning information over data networks and computer-controlled warning systems. By limiting transport-specific nomenclature, CAP remains fully compatible with existing public warning systems, including those designed for multilingual and special-needs populations, as well as with XML applications such as Web <span class="style2">services. ...<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis_news_05_05_04.php" target="_off">Full Story

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong> ANSI News and Publications, Washington, D.C., May 17, 2004 --</strong> The European Union Framework for the setting of Eco-design requirements for Energy Using Products (EuP) will soon be law. Moving rapidly though the legislative process and wider in scope than any related existing Community legislation, this Directive has the potential to create burdensome requirements for manufacturers of products selected by it&rsquo;s &ldquo;implementing measures&rdquo; to prove their designs are environmentally efficient. However, if U.S. industry sectors can coordinate with their European counterparts to generate voluntary agreements, they will likely be able to keep from being named as a target of the Directive&rsquo;s implementing measures. The European Commission published its Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a Framework for the Setting of Eco-design Requirements for Energy-Using Products and amending Council Directive 92/42/EEC in August last year, and it may become law at the end of this year or early next year. ...<a href="http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=685" target="_off">Full Story </a></p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong> ETSI.org, Sophia-Antipolis, France, 13 May 2004 --</strong> Today the ink is drying on a renewal of the commitment by the European and the U.S.A. standards bodies to the principles of cooperation and partnership. The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) of the United States and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) used the occasion of their participation in the Global Standards Collaboration (GSC-9), meeting this week in Seoul - Korea, to renew the TIA/ETSI cooperation agreement for another three years. The agreement was last renewed at the GSC meeting in Sydney Australia in 2001. Both organizations were created in 1988 and there has been ETSI/TIA cooperation since 1990. This renewal will allow for further cooperation at the committee level. More than 60 Working Groups have been identified as having areas of mutual interest. <span class="style2">...<a href="http://www.etsi.org/pressroom/Previous/2004/2004_05_agreement_TIA.htm" target="_off">Full Story
