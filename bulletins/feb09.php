			<h4>EDITOR'S NOTE:</h4>
			<h3>With Access and Information for All</h3>
			<p>This issue marks the third and final (for now) entry in a cycle that addresses the role of technical standards in government, and vice versa, occasioned by the election of America's new, technologically-savvy president, Barack Obama. Each of these issues looks back to a greater or lesser extent to a concept I introduced a year ago in an article titled <a href="/bulletins/feb08.php">Recognizing "Civil ICT Rights" and Civil ICT Standards</a>.</p>
			<p>The first issue in this cycle was intended to provide an overview of the standards opportunities, and standards dependencies, of Mr. Obama's ambitious technology technology-based agenda, and was called <a href="/bulletins/oct08.php">A Standards Agenda for the Obama Administration</a>, while the second focused more narrowly on the President's most ambitious (and costly) standards-dependent program (that issue was called <a href="/bulletins/dec08.php">The Electronic Health Record Standards Challenge</a>).  This issue addresses another important goal established by Barack Obama early in his campaign, and confirmed on the first day of his presidency: a commitment to bring about a new level of public transparency, participation and collaboration in government, in large part through the innovative use of technology.</p>
			<p>I introduce this theme with my <strong><em><a href="#editorial">Editorial</a></em></strong>, which makes the point that if Internet-based government is to be truly open, it needs to be accessible to all &mdash; and not just those who can afford a laptop or desktop, know how to use it, and are not held back by physical disabilities.</p>
			<p>This month's <strong><em><a href="#feature">Feature Article</a></em></strong> addresses the broader IT challenge of making the IT systems of government agencies internally interoperable and externally transparent and collaborative at the same time.  Like the <strong><em><a href="#blog">Standards Blog</a></em></strong> selection for the month, it refers in part to the already well advanced and sophisticated efforts of the European Union to achieve similar goals.</p>
			<p>The issue concludes, as usual, on a lighter note with my newest installment of <strong><em><a href="#considerthis">Consider This</a></em></strong>, which shines a harsh light on a standard of a different &mdash; and much less popular &mdash; type altogether: the much maligned but tenacious billable hour of law firms at home and abroad.</p>
			<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this issue.  Whether you do or don't, it's always good to hear from you.  You can reach me at andrew.updegrove@gesmer.com.</p>

			<h4>EDITORIAL:</h4>
			<h3>Enabling Open Government for All</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>One of the refreshing promises that Barack Obama made to the nation during the recent campaign was to bring greater openness and transparency to the operation of government.  What distinguished this pledge from those of his predecessors was his commitment to go beyond soft promises of greater candor in press conferences and fewer assertions of privilege.  This administration, he pledged, would provide an unprecedented level of access to information and direct interaction with government, enabling a richly interactive, ongoing dialogue between citizens and their elected representatives.</p>
			<div class="calloutright">
				<p>Achieving true openness in government will rely as much on the manner in which openness is technically enabled as it will upon the commitment of the administration to be truly forthcoming.</p>
			</div>
			<p>The president reaffirmed that promise immediately upon his inauguration, in a directive he issued to the heads of all federal executive departments and agencies.  In that memorandum, he committed his administration to, "work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration."  The transparency would be achieved in part by harnessing, "new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online and readily available to the public," and the promised participation and collaboration would be made possible by, "innovative tools, methods, and systems."  He charged the nation's first Chief Technology Officer and other senior administration leaders with turning his instructions into an Open Government Directive within 120 days.</p>
			<p>As with much of the new administration's lofty goals, reality and the press of the current economic crisis have made implementation significantly more challenging than conceptualization. Indeed, more than half of those 120 days have now gone by, and President Obama's CTO has not yet been appointed, while the start date for Vivek Kundra, the former CTO of the District of Columbia and Mr. Obama's pick to be Chief Information Officer, was unexpectedly delayed, pending completion of an investigation into the acts of two of his former subordinates. Meanwhile, countless bloggers and journalists cast critical eyes over every move and statement the new administration makes, debating whether it lives up to the President's pledge.  And Mr. Obama's staff are struggling to adapt to a technical infrastructure that is far less nimble than the state of the art platform they created for the president-to-be's campaign.</p>
			<p>Beneath the surface of these public and all-too typical events, however, a number of less visible challenges stand in the way of keeping the President's open government promises.  They can be summed up with a simple question: "transparency, public participation and collaboration for <em>whom</em>?"  The answer to that question is obvious, from an aspirational perspective, but not so simple to achieve technically.</p>
			<p>The problem arises from the mixed blessings of technology.  If the major benefits of the new policy are delivered via the Internet, then by definition these benefits will be available only to those that have the access and skills needed to locate, review, and interact with what has been made available on line.  As a result, achieving true openness in government will rely as much on the manner in which openness is technically enabled as it will upon the commitment of the administration to be truly forthcoming.</p>
			<p>Having said that, what should be done?</p>
			<p>Providing a free computer to every American is clearly not in the economic cards.  But ensuring that everything that the government provides on line rigorously supports all accessibility standards and can be accessed by the greatest range of devices (e.g., browser-equipped cell phones), running the most diverse range of operating systems and software applications, will make an enormous difference.</p>
			<p>In the past, many government Web sites have served pages that often render poorly (or not at all) on some popular browsers, and have provided or accepted documents in only one or two proprietary document formats.  The result has been to force citizens to download or purchase the specific software products that support this technology, or be denied access to the public information at all.  Famously, Apple computer users running Safari, the Apple Web browser, found themselves unable to access urgently needed emergency information in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, because the government Web sites posting that information supported only Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser.  Similarly, many government sites still do not support the accessibility standards that are essential to allow many citizens with visual and other physical handicaps to access and interact with these sites.</p>
			<p>On the one hand, then, we have the past, where a fully equipped desktop or laptop computer, running proprietary software, was needed to exercise citizenship rights on line, assuming that the owner was fully sighted and able-bodied.  If this is also the future, then the promise of transparent, participatory and collaborative government will be a democratic embarrassment, rather than an egalitarian promise fulfilled.</p>
			<p>To ensure that better future, the government must set itself the task of provisioning Web sites that citizens can access using not only desktops and laptops, but also the types of devices that almost all citizens can afford and know how to use &mdash; increasingly powerful and inexpensive cell phones, smart phones and netbook computers running open source as well as proprietary software &mdash; then the true promise of open government will be realized.</p>
			<p>Though few will realize it, this goal can only be realized by committing &mdash; now &mdash; to the mandatory implementation of the full range of interoperability and accessibility standards needed to ensure that all Web pages will render properly and usefully on all devices running all operating systems and other appropriate software.  The great majority of these standards already exist, and the remaining tools are currently under development in consortia such as the W3C and OASIS.  All that is required is the decision to select and use them.</p>
			<p>Too often in our history we have allowed our democratic reach to exceed the grasp of the less fortunate.  It will be sad indeed if, through indifference, this most hopeful and progressive of recent administrations provides open government not for all, but only for the technically sophisticated, the able-bodied, and the well to do.</p>

			<h3>"Openness," Customers and the IDABC</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<img class="imgleft" src="feb09/feb09_img1.gif" alt="" width="150" height="99" border="0" />
			<p>Any old standards hand forced to choose the single most disputed issue in standard setting over the past decade would likely respond with a deceivingly simple question: "What does it mean to be an 'open standard?'"  A similar debate rages in the open source community between those that believe that some licenses (e.g., the BSD, MIT and Apache licenses) are "open enough," while others would respond with an emphatic  <em>Hell No!</em> (or less printable words to similar effect).</p>
			<p>That's not too surprising, because the question of what "open" means subsumes almost every other categorical question that information and communications technology (ICT) standards and open source folk are likely to disagree over, whether they be economic (should a vendor be able to be implement a standard free of charge, or in free and open source software (FOSS) licensed under a version of the General Public License (GPL)); systemic (are standards adopted by ISO/IEC JTC 1 "better" than those that are not); or procedural (must the economic and other terms upon which a necessary patent claim can be licensed be disclosed early in the development process)?</p>
			<p>One school of thought holds that there should be no single definition of "openness" in standards (or open source code), as this would in some cases needlessly over-constrain the development of standards (or source code).  By this line of reasoning (and narrowing the focus just to standards), "openness" should be conceptualized not as an absolute, but as something that exists along a pragmatic continuum, with progressively stricter requirements applying depending upon contextual factors, such as who will use the standard or software, for how long, and for what purpose.</p>
			<p>Underlying the debate is the necessity of balancing the rights of the owners of any intellectual property rights (IPR) that might be infringed by the implementers of a standard with the benefits to society and industry that can be obtained from wide adoption &mdash; a complex question, when it is remembered that the owner of such a claim can often gain significant indirect as well as direct benefits from such adoption.  Given that standard setting is a consensual process and that it is not possible to compel a non-member to make any promises at all, it is hardly surprising that different balance points have been found within any given organization, and in particular among diverse industry niches.</p>
			<p>Traditionally, openness related discussions leading to the adoption of IPR policies have been "bottom down" in nature, in that those that develop standards have decided what they are, and are not, willing to do.  In other words, the opinion of the customer  has been largely missing from the equation, because they are usually underrepresented, when they are represented at all, in the standards development process.  This, because although customers are welcome at the standards development table, few have taken up the invitation.  Nor should this be a surprise, because participation in standards development is time consuming and expensive, and individual customers usually have much less to gain or risk from how a standard turns out than a vendor.  Consequently, most customers have traditionally been content (or at least willing) to take what they have been given.</p>
			<p>Now, however, this dynamic is shifting with respect to one particular type of customer, and the agents of change are governments, in their capacities both as customers and as the developers of policy.</p>
			<div class="calloutright">
				<p>Governments today are beginning to offer new answers to the question, "What does it mean to be an ‘open standard'?"</p>
			</div>
			<p>Governments have always been interested parties in standards development, and especially in areas such as health and safety.  But governments have largely played a passive rather than an influential role when it comes to developing ICT openness requirements.</p>
			<p>With governments in many nations becoming enamored with the potential for something new called Open Government or "eGovernment," however, legislators and bureaucrats alike are taking a harder look at what openness does &mdash; or should mean.  While only some candidate attributes of openness are relevant to interactions with citizens (e.g., accessibility), others are meaningful to governments as consumers of ICT standards for their internal usage, and still others are vital with respect to the performance by governments of specific public functions, such as archival storage, where such standards were never relevant before.</p>
			<p>But where to begin?   Some governments are only now awakening to these concerns.  But others have been studying these issues for some time.  Their emerging conclusions are instructive, and can serve as an important roadmap for those that are only now beginning their examinations.</p>
			<p>In January of 2005, the European Commission created a new programme, called the <em>Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administration, Business and Citizens</em> (IDABC), and charged it with investigating how the EU could move forward into a future in which information could freely flow not only among EU agencies, but also between these agencies and those of EU Member States (MS), and between all of the above and their citizens.  Such a system would not (indeed, could not) be forced upon the MS, but the recommendations and models developed in collaboration between the IDABC and MS could be employed by the MS as they saw fit to achieve the common goal.</p>
			<p>Last year, the IDABC released drafts of several new deliverables that demonstrate what must be one of the most thorough, thoughtful and pragmatic efforts ever mounted to envision what an interoperable eGovernment should look like, and how it can be achieved.  These deliverables include a lengthy study intended to serve as one of the principal bases for version 2.0 of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF 2.0), and a Report and Proposal for a Common Assessment Method for Standards and Specifications (CAMSS) that can be profitably employed by governmental entities of any type,  anywhere.  Importantly, each of these represents a substantial advance in the examination and determination of what should constitutes openness in government ICT standards from both an aspirational as well as a pragmatic perspective.</p>
			<p>Significantly, one of the cornerstone requirements for achieving interoperability identified in the original (2004) version of the EIF is the use of open standards, which in EIF 1.0 are defined as having the following minimum attributes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbers">The open standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organisation, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties (consensus or majority decision etc.).<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">The open standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">The intellectual property &mdash; i.e. patents possibly present &mdash; of (parts of) the open standard is made irrevocably available on a royalty free basis.<br /><br /></li>
				<li class="numbers">There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These recommendations met with wide, but not universal, approval.  Some vendors of proprietary products were especially unhappy that a requirement to charge a royalty could potentially invalidate a standard from consideration for inclusion in a tender for government procurement.  The IDABC countered by noting that such royalties could make interaction with government too expensive for some citizens, and that royalty-bearing standards could help entrench dominant vendors, decrease competition, and result in less innovation.</p>
			<p>The new basis document for EIF 2.0 goes even further, noting in part as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>Since the publication of version 1 of the EIF, several practical cases have however shown the necessity to clearly point out the extent of this definition and to clarify its applicability&hellip;.</blockquote>
			<ol>
				<li>Open standards or technical specifications must allow all interested parties to implement the standards and to compete on quality and price. The goal is to have a competitive and innovative industry, not to protect market shares by raising obstacles to newcomers.  Also, we want to be able to choose open source solutions or proprietary solutions on the basis of price/quality consideration&hellip;<br /><br /></li>
				<li>Practices distorting the definition of open standards or technical specifications should be addressed by protecting the integrity of the standardisation process&hellip;.<br /><br /></li>
				<li>This definition reflects a consumer's viewpoint, with his needs uppermost in mind&hellip;.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The last point, perhaps, is the most significant, when read in the context of those that precede it.  It puts vendors on notice that while they cannot be forced to make their patent claims available for free, or on terms conducive to licensing under Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licensing terms, or prevented from advancing their agendas preferentially in compliant development venues (subject to the limits of anticompetition laws), neither can they force governments to buy their wares.</p>
			<p>These documents, which were posted for public comment through September 22 of last year, represent but the latest deliverables of a carefully considered and practical process.  The definition and requirements for open standards that the IDABC has developed are both sound in substance and founded on real and well articulated justifications.</p>
			<p>I believe that the EU is following a path that is leading towards the type of interoperability within governments, and between governments and citizens, that should serve as a model for governments everywhere.  Hopefully governments around the world will so conclude as well.  If they do decide to follow along on the carefully considered roadmap that the IDABC and the Member States of the EU have laid out, vendors as well as citizens will benefit, as achieving a global consensus on what constitutes an open standard for government procurement must inevitably serve to rationalize and expand the market for compliant products.</p>

			<h3><span class="red">#57</span> Killing the Cockroach: The Incredibly Illogical,<br />Fundamentally Odious &mdash; but Seemingly Ineradicable<br />&mdash; Billable Hour</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p><em>The service the lawyer renders is his professional knowledge and skill, but the commodity he sells is time</em> &mdash; Reginald Heber Smith, inventor of the billable hour</p>
			<p><em>Both reviled and ubiquitous, the billable hour is the cockroach of the legal world</em> &mdash; Douglas McCollam, writing in the American Lawyer</p>
			<img class="imgleft" src="feb09/feb09_img2.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="200" border="0" />
			<p>Let's imagine that you would like to have your dilapidated, wood-sided house painted.  The southern exposure is peeling, the soffits sport dark Rorschach patterns of mildew, and more than a few window sills have that uncomfortably punky feel to the touch that whispers "we're rotting &mdash; you must help us."  You know that you can't put off facing the music any longer, and hope that the impact on your wallet will be no more painful than absolutely necessary.</p>
			<p>So you do what any rational homeowner would &mdash; you get some referrals from people you trust, call the folks they recommend, and tell each of them that you'll be soliciting several bids.  While you're at it, you also call the painter who, as luck would have it, had dropped a flyer in your mailbox that very afternoon.</p>
			<div class="calloutright">
				<p>How did such an illogical and unequal standard get established, and how does it survive?</p>
			</div>
			<p>Over the next week each housepainter stops by after work, walks around your house, scribbles a few notes, and promises to get back to you with a quote.  Within a week, most of them actually do.  Like any homeowner would, you select the cheapest, failing to note that it came from the painter you found through the flyer.   Soon, the job is done, and he drops by to collect the agreed upon amount.  Pleased, you pay him on the spot.</p>
			<p>What a nice, logical system, especially for the buyer.  You know just what you'll have to pay before you commit to pay it, and gain the benefit of competitive bidding as well.  You'd be crazy to take on such a large financial commitment any other way, wouldn't you?</p>
			<p>Let's say, though, that a year goes by, and the house starts to peel.  Calls to the painter go unanswered, so you get in touch with another painter, who stops by and shakes his head pityingly.  He informs you  that flyer-man applied cheap latex over the old oil paint, didn't wash the mildew off the soffits or stabilize the rot in those windowsills.  You'll need to have the whole job repeated &mdash; soon.</p>
			<p>More calls go unanswered to the original painter, so it's referral time again &mdash; for a lawyer.  Soon you are sitting in the office of the attorney with the best recommendation, and are recounting your tale of familiar woe.</p>
			<p>After you agree to work together, you meekly ask how much it will cost.  The answer is, "Oh, well, that's hard to say.  It depends on so many things&hellip;"  Although she gives you a ballpark estimate, that's all it is.  She goes on to say that she will bill you monthly, with the amount invoiced based on the new time she has spent on your case.  Oh &mdash; and the retainer to begin work will be $1,000, thank you very much.</p>
			<p>Welcome to the improbable and seemingly impregnable world of the lawyers' billable hour &mdash; perhaps the only pervasive, virtually undisputed commercial standard in existence that puts almost all of the risk on the buyer, and where the cost of the commoditized product goes up, not down, year after year.</p>
			<p>How did such an illogical and unequal standard become so well established, and how does it survive?  Good questions.  The first one is easy.  But there's really no good answer for the second one at all, although I invite you to consider the following.</p>
			<p>The billable hour traces its origins to one Reginald Heber Smith, a Harvard graduate with a mind that that ran to quantification as naturally as water runs downhill (his other lasting contribution was a formula for calculating partner compensation.  it's  still referred to by some as the "Smith System").  In 1914, Smith was hired to head Boston Legal Aid, and soon decided that its finances were in need of an overhaul.  The concept of "Scientific Management" had just been introduced and was all the rage, and Harvard Business School was located conveniently near by.  Smith enlisted his alma mater's aid, and soon was applying his brand of scientific principles to the management of the practice of law.</p>
			<p>Word spread, and soon Mr. Smith was the managing partner of the (even then) venerable Boston law firm of Messrs. Hale and Dorr (now Wilmer Hale, following its merger with the D.C. firm of Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering).  And so the seed of the billable hour came to be planted in the flinty soil of the private practice of law.</p>
			<p>The billable hour did not initially propagate, kudzu-like, through the legal world.  After all, commoditizing a profession seemed demeaning to many attorneys.  And in order to be effective, lawyers needed to submit to another annoying Smith invention: the paper time sheet.  On that rigid, ruled rectangle, every lawyer was required to record the time, client name, and task description for everything he did during the day.  As if to rub it in, Mr. Smith's time sheet was marked in six minute increments.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, what was taking root in other law firms was another, equally insidious system: the minimum fee schedule.  Rather incredibly, in light of the spirit, if not the letter, of antitrust law, bar associations were hard at work creating flat fee schedules for common legal tasks.  By the 1940s, it had become an ethics violation under the rules of some states to financially undercut thy fellow attorney.  Meanwhile, Reginald Heber Smith's seminal management work, "Law Office Organization," was in its eleventh printing, and the process of litigation, in particular, had become more complex (read: risky &mdash; for the law firm) to prosecute on a fixed-fee basis.</p>
			<p>When the Supreme Court at last (in 1975!) applied to legal services similar rules to those that had long prohibited price fixing in the sale of products, the billable hour's hour had truly come at last.</p>
			<div class="calloutright">
				<p>Why does the much-loathed and unwelcome billable hour, like the cockroach, continue to infest the legal kitchen?</p>
			</div>
			<p>Which more or less brings us to today &mdash; or almost.  For some time now, the billable hour and its many failings have been much commented upon.  Associates and partners alike hate the slavery of the time sheet and the billable hour requirements that, like their billable hourly rates, continue to creep upwards.  Clients resent the uncertainty of the bills they receive and their consequent lack of control over their legal budgets, not to mention the fact that an hour of busy work is charged out at the same rate as an hour of truly valuable advice.  And no one denies that the billable hour system sets the best interests of the law firm against those of the client, resulting in a constant temptation for lawyers to over-staff projects, over-research legal issues and over-estimate time spent.</p>
			<p>The result has been an ongoing dialogue in the legal profession over so-called "alternative billing systems," with many opinions offered on what such systems might look like, and how they might work (as if the rest of the professional &mdash; or for that matter the house painters' &mdash; world doesn't already have enough models from which to choose).</p>
			<p>So why does the much-loathed and unwelcome billable hour, like the cockroach, continue to infest the legal kitchen?</p>
			<p>The explanation, if not an adequate answer, is pure and simple.  On the law firm side, the culprit is unbridled self interest.  Keeping time sheets and meeting hourly expectations may demean and oppress hapless associates, but the results are beloved by law firm managers, because they dramatically increase the ability to budget more reliably and lower risk more consistently (Reginald Heber Smith may have been a number nerd, but he was after all no fool).  So the law firms are few and far between that have abandoned the seductive billable hour, once they have succumbed to its siren song.</p>
			<p>On the client side, the answer would appear to be mostly one of inertia.  Even in-house general counsels that trained in big law firms and should know better continue to tolerate billable hour-based bills, perhaps because the cost and effect are at least trackable, detailed and familiar.  Moreover, it's easy to simply ask for a discount off a firm's hourly rack rate, and hourly rates provide a simplistic way to cost-compare between law firms and individual attorneys.  Perhaps the fact that lawyers are rarely accused of imagination may factor into the mix as well.</p>
			<p>The real genius of Mr. Smith, perhaps, was to apply the principles of "scientific management" to legal services early on in the development of the business management discipline, affording the billable hour a faux veneer of respectability, and camouflaged the basic illogicality of a system that values reading email the same as negotiating a multi-billion dollar merger.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, though, I expect that the invisible hand of Adam Smith will not remain sprained forever.  Surely, some day it will heal, and just as the United Auto Workers in Detroit are finding that the real world has caught up with them, the hard heel of the marketplace will come down on the billable hour as well.</p>
			<p>When it does, there will be a crunch that will reverberate around the client world, and the legal kitchen will never be the same again.</p>
