                    <p align="left"> <span class="style2">Early this summer, this writer first heard of some surprising planning going on inside ISO, the global standard setting body that manages over 13,000 standards. The word was that ISO'S Commercial Policies Steering Group was considering levying use charges for the pervasive and simple language, currency and two letter country codes that it maintains. These codes are not only used in print, but are employed behind the scenes in software programs and web pages as well. </span></p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">When word later reached a wider audience, the reaction was immediate and hostile, with both consortia and accredited standards organizations protesting the concept of use fees for copyrighted standards data. Press reaction and piling on by bloggers predictably followed. Finally, on September 30, 2003, ISO issued a clarification that addressed the central concern, but which left some observers still wondering where all will settle out in a practical, commercial sense. At the end of this article, we have aggregated some of the press releases, open letters, press accounts and blog entries that appeared during the twelve-day period in question. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">But first, one unfamiliar with the fracas might ask, what's the big deal about, anyway? </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">The reasons for the breadth and depth of industry reaction were several: First, the trend toward free implementation of standards has been picking up steam of late, with many of the most influential consortia (e.g., W3C and OpenGIS) adopting policies strongly in support of royalty-free standards. Second, the marketplace is still absorbing the (to many) shocking series of victories that Rambus has racked up in court in its effort to collect royalties from the implementers of certain JEDEC chip standards. Add to that SCO's efforts to sack the Linux marketplace for alleged infringement of the Unix OS, and anyone concerned with standards could be excused for being a bit touchy these days, if not downright grouchy. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">It also didn't help that ISO is the 900 pound gorilla of standard setting, with hundreds of affiliated standards organizations around the world, or that the country codes seem so innocuous. The fact is, though, that the revenue model of the official standards development organizations of the world (SDOs) has been absorbing a one-two punch from the rise Internet and the proliferation of consortia. That's because, unlike most consortia, SDOs are cheap to join, and therefore able to accommodate the views of everyone. In order to do so, they underwrite a major part of their expenses by selling paper copies of the standards that they approve and maintain. Consortia, on the other hand, are usually expensive to join, but almost always give their standards away, since the goal of their members is to secure widespread adoption of the standards that these self-selected groups of members wish to promote. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">It's a real problem for SDOs, involving a century-old standards infrastructure that evolved to set standards for a bricks and mortar world. And for that world, it still serves pretty well. But in the rapidly evolving IT and telecommunications industry, major stakeholders want to move more quickly, and to remove as many barriers to adoption of the standards that they create as possible. That means making their standards just one fee-free, click-wrap license press of the mouse button away for anyone, members and non-members alike. Since many companies make bet-the-company decisions to launch products based on these standards, they are willing to pay dues of $10,000, or $50,000 -- or more -- per company to a single consortium to get a new standard done fast and pervasively adopted. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">Meanwhile, the low membership-fee SDOs still need to pay the bills. So it's neither surprising nor &quot;wrong&quot; for them to be creative in thinking about how to get their still-necessary job done in changing times. But it looks like this time at bat, they've hit a foul ball. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">Another reason why much of the standards world is in arms is because the implementation of standards has historically presented royalty issues only where patents have been involved. With the ISO country codes, it is the copyrights in codes that ISO would be asserting. But instead of charging just once for the original copy of the codes, the fear was that a fee would be collected every time there was a sale of a product with embedded codes (or a substantial up-front fee would be levied for unlimited use rights). Think of it as having to put another quarter in the coin slot of the phone booth (remember phone booths?) if you wanted to use the phone book as well as the phone. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">The thought of charging for incorporation of country codes also touched another hot button: many specifications (including key Internet infrastructural standards) &quot;reference&quot;, or incorporate, ISO and other SDO standards. If these organizations were to begin charging for repeat use of standards generally, the domino effect would cascade throughout the global IT infrastructure. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, the concept of charging for something as simplistic as a compilation of two letter codes invoked a legal objection as well. The issue here is that there is a well developed (albeit recent) line of cases that has held that mere compilations of data, absent a creative element, are not eligible to receive copyright protection (think again about a phone book). </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style2">Following the outraged responses of multiple standards organizations, including the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), INCITS and the Unicode Consortium, ISO issued a statement saying that the various codes themselves would remain free, while a new &quot;optional software services package&quot; relating to country codes might be deployed for a fee. Whether or not the former will be commercially valuable without the latter will remain to be seen. Some have responded that the updating service, as a practical matter, would be needed. And there is where things stand for now. </p>

                </strong><span class="style2">By Evan Hansen </span></p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>CNET News.com, September 19, 2003 </strong> -- Information technology standards groups are raising warning flags over a proposal that could raise fees for commonly used industry codes, including two-letter country abbreviations, used in many commercial software products. At stake is a tentative proposal from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to add usage royalties for several code standards, a move that opponents say could weaken standards adherence by forcing software providers to pay a fee for each ISO-compliant product they sell. The standards -- ISO 3166, ISO 4217, ISO 639 -- cover country, currency and language codes, respectively. The proposal is still in the early stages, and may yet be significantly altered or shelved&hellip;. [in the words of Martin Duerst, W3C Internationalization Activity Lead] &quot;It's not so much a legal question as a question of standards policy&hellip;.If you start asking for money for the usage, people will stop using the standard. Then...there will be chaos.&quot; </p>

    September 30, 2003 (ISO Website) </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">[The following press release has been reproduced verbatim &ndash; <em>editor </em>] </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"><em>ISO issues the following statement in response to recently publicized misunderstandings of its current practice and intentions regarding its widely used country, currency and language codes. </em></p>
                <div align="left">
                  <ul>
                      <li class="style2">ISO is to continue with its established practice of allowing free-of-charge use of its country, currency and language codes from, respectively, the ISO 3166, ISO 4217 and ISO 639 standards, in commercial and other applications. </li>
                      <li class="style2">There is no proposal currently being considered by ISO to impose charges for use of these codes, including on the World Wide Web and in software applications. </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Based on international consensus reached within the ISO standards development system, these codes reduce the confusion that could be created if there were multiple, conflicting codes in common use. The development of the Web and of electronic commerce has been facilitated by the existence of the ISO standardized codes and their use has become pervasive. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">ISO encourages such developments by making the two-letter country codes contained in ISO 3166 available free of charge on <a href="http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO's Web site </a>, along with a great deal of regularly updated information related to the codes and their use. The ISO Web site also has hyperlinks to the sites of the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the US Library of Congress - where the <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Technical%2BInformation/Publications/_Publications/tig90.xalter">currency </a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html">language </a> codes are, respectively, publicly available. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">The full ISO 3166, ISO 4217 and ISO 639 standards from which these codes are drawn are available from ISO and its members on a sales basis, as a contribution to supporting the standards development process. However, ISO and its members do not charge for the use made of the codes contained in these standards, subject to this being consistent with ISO's copyright. For example, ISO does not charge organizations for the inclusion of the country codes in their Internet domain names, and ISO does not charge banks for using the currency codes in their electronic financial transactions. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">If a user of the codes, such as a software developer, wishes to claim that its product incorporates the codes in conformity with the ISO standards (which could be perceived by the market as an added value), then it would have an interest in buying the standards to make sure that this is indeed the case. But this is a &quot;one-off&quot; transaction for purchase of the standards; ISO does not subsequently charge a fee for use of the codes in the software product and has no plans for doing so. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Like many organizations, ISO continually reviews its practices and products in order to provide added value to its customers. With regard to ISO 3166, ISO is considering a proposal to develop an optional software service package that would facilitate incorporation and maintenance of the country codes in IT products. The service package being considered would include regular updating of the codes, which would add value to products because they would be conforming to the International Standard ISO 3166. The service package being considered would be a charged option. However, no decision has yet been made to go ahead and even if this option were developed, ISO will continue to allow use of its country, currency and language codes free of charge.</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">Infineon's quest to restore its jury verdict, and thereby avoid the requirement to pay an estimated $45 million a year in royalties to patent owner Rambus, ended in defeat on October 6, when the Supreme Court announced that it would not review the Circuit Court holding in <em>Infineon v. Rambus </em>. The <em>Rambus </em> case has become one of the most closely-watched cases in standard setting of recent years (The <strong><em>CSB </em></strong> has been following this case on a monthly basis since February; see, e.g., <strong><em><a href="/bulletins/feb03.php#editorial" target="_off">Rambus: Hard Cases Make Bad Law</a></em></strong> ). After the Circuit Court overturned a jury court's finding of fraud on the part of Rambus, the case became a focus of more than just the directly affected world of chip vendors. Lucash, Gesmer &amp; Updegrove LLP (the host of this site) filed a &ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo; brief in support of Infineon on behalf of 10 standard setting organizations representing over 8,600 companies, government agencies and universities in support of Infineon, as did the Attorneys General of 15 States and Puerto Rico (see: <strong><em><a href="/bulletins/aug03.php#rambusupdate" target="_off">States, SDOs, Consortia all Unite to Support Infineon</a> </em></strong>). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Day traders, for whom Rambus was a long-term darling, rejoiced over the high Court's decision, and Rambus' stock shot upwards. Meanwhile, Infineon (and the other companies sued by Rambus for refusing to pay up) were left to lick their wounds and consider their next moves. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The story does not, however, end here. The antitrust-based suit brought against Rambus by the FTC entered the final argument stage several weeks ago. A large amount of testimony has been developed in the process of that proceeding that has suggested new dimensions to the case. And the Infineon case itself now returns to the trial court for further consideration within the parameters established by the Circuit Court, and left in place by the Supreme Court. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Hundreds of articles have been written since the Supreme Court's announcement, of which the following are representative of the attention paid in the initial hours after the high Court's announcement. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>LOS ALTOS, Calif. - </strong> Rambus Inc. (Nasdaq:RMBS), a leading provider of chip-to-chip interface products and services, today announced that the United States Supreme Court has issued a ruling denying Infineon Technologies's (NYSE:IFX) petition for a writ of certiorari in the litigation between Infineon and Rambus. This ruling, announced by the Supreme Court today, means that Infineon has exhausted all possible avenues of appeal from the January 29, 2003 ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That Federal Circuit ruling favored Rambus. It confirmed the breadth of Rambus's patent claims as asserted against Infineon. It also rejected Infineon's fraud counterclaims, concluding that Rambus had not been shown to have violated the rules of an industry standard setting organization called JEDEC and that those rules showed a &quot;staggering lack of defining details.&quot; The Federal Circuit also concluded that Rambus did not have applications or patents that read on any JEDEC standard during the relevant time. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">Shares of <strong>Rambus </strong> (RMBS:Nasdaq) vaulted 35% in midafternoon trading following a favorable U.S. Supreme Court decision. The stock climbed $6.48 to $25.21 in recent trading. Rambus is at the center of a web of ongoing patent litigation, including an antitrust case filed by the Federal Trade Commission. The complaints have alleged that Rambus deceived an industry standards-setting organization in the early 1990s, helping to set standards in a way that favored its own technologies and later reaping royalties from memory manufacturers. But today, Rambus scored a major victory when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed an earlier favorable court ruling by declining to hear an appeal in a case involving memory maker <strong>Infineon </strong> (IFX:NYSE). </p>

              <p align="left"><span class="style42">[] [] [] October 15, 2003 - </span> <span class="style2">If you've been reading the IT press lately, its likely that the name &quot;Dan Geer&quot; will ring a bell. If not, type the search &quot;geer + microsoft&quot; into Google and you'll be able to access 70,000 hits. Sorry; that was 15 minutes ago. Now its 75,300 hits. Seems like something's going on here. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">That something is a report entitled &quot;Cyber In security: the Cost of Monopoly&quot;, co-authored by Dan Geer and six other security gurus. The thrust of the report is that a world that relies on a single, tightly integrated OS and applications environment controlled by a single vendor is more vulnerable to attack -- and disastrously so -- than a world that relies on a more diverse IT environment. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a long-time critic of all things Microsoft, published the report. Geer, the CTO of @stake, inc., a security firm, learned the day after the report was issued that he had been retroactively fired as of the day prior to the report's release. By coincidence, Microsoft is a major customer of @stake. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">What, you may ask, does this have to do with alpha predators, let alone standards? Several things: </p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li class="style2">The more the IT world evolves, the more it emulates an eerie subjectivity to the laws of physical nature, notwithstanding its virtuality. The adoption of biology-based terms such as &quot;virus&quot;, &quot;neural networks&quot; and, in the case of the Geer report, &quot;computer monoculture&quot; seems to be not only convenient, but also even unavoidable. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li class="style2">Hence, the best predictions of future risks -- and the most instructive source of models for future solutions -- are often found in nature. Mother nature, it appears, even looks after her virtual own. </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="left" class="style2">If one accepts this premise, then many of the conclusions of the Geer report become manifest: just as a single, newly-mutated virus can wipe out an entire species limited by a depleted gene pool, the world's Microsoft-based systems can be taken down by a teen-aged hacker in need of a date. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But - natural science reveals another risk as well: the destabilizing influence of the removal of a &quot;keystone predator&quot;. In this model, it is recognized that the role of the top predator in an ecosystem has a moderating influence on most, or all, of the downstream species. Remove the alpha predator, and all hell breaks loose. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Remove the alpha predator, and equilibrium of a sort will eventually be restored, but that equilibrium is likely to be at the cost of multiple extinctions, long periods of population booms and busts, and overall ecological degradation. In David Quammen's latest book, &quot;Monster of God&quot;, the author goes even further, postulating that our lives are in some way enriched (or at least informed) by the humbling reality that our essential value in the ecosystem can be reduced to mere calories. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">So what does Mother Nature teach us? That we're better off protecting the alpha predator, the ultimate devil we know? Is Geer wrong? Should we come not to bury Microsoft, but to praise and protect it? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">I think not. The trick is to discern what else we can learn from nature, and seek a different course, one that leads where we want to go, and with the winds of nature at our backs. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">And that takes us back to standards. The IT world need only be constrained to follow the rules of the physical world to the extent that it is bound by its physics. Change a variable in the program, and the fractal patterns must change. Happily, some of the variables in the IT world are within our control. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">One of those variables involves our ability to agree on interconnections, interfaces, enablements -- in short, standards. Standards, by their nature, create evolutionary opportunities that are beneficial. And, because these opportunities are made available as well as beneficial, vendors have no choice but to take advantage of these evolution pathways. Linux is a sterling example of a successful effort to adjust the dial of commercial gravity. Once the opportunity to make money by offering Linux-based products came into credible existence, the rules of virtual commercial physics left vendors no alternative but to build such products. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The lesson, then, is not to fight gravity exclusively with antitrust legislation and other man-made rules that seek to outlaw the laws of virtual commercial physics. That type of fight is far too exhausting, and always, ultimately unsuccessful. (Remember communism?) </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The lesson of nature, instead, is to set standards that make the path to diversification appear to be manifestly easier, strategically safer, and ultimately more commercially desirable -- even for the alpha predators. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Then just stand back. </p>

The company has thrown its weight behind a wireless group's effort to define a DRM specification on mobile devices. Ultimately, though, Sun hopes to build a coalition of vendors and end-users similar to the Liberty Alliance Project to drive uptake of DRM. Sun's goal is to counter Windows software and hardware initiatives from Microsoft, which it says will leave that company in control of users' business data and other digital content. Sun CTO John Fowler said yesterday: "You can see what we do around Liberty as a similar effort for DRM. Then we will do what we did with Java, and promulgate that in volume."</p>

A significant portion of this could be on the emerging eXtensible business reporting language (XBRL) standard, which allow companies to present financial reports in standard electronics formats. &quot;It's our belief that if beta testing with NASDAQ goes well, the exchange will require all companies to report financial information using XBRL in the future,&quot; Retter says. &quot;Additionally, the UK could implement XBRL initiatives by the end of next year and Canada will also follow.&quot; </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>Sophia-Antipolis, France, 15th October 2003 </strong>- The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has completed the majority of the standardization programme necessary for the harmonized use of Ultra Low Power Active Medical Implants (ULP-AMIs) in Europe. The medical world will then just need the harmonization of frequency bands to enable implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators and insulin pumps, to be used by patients when traveling from one European country to another....Without common standards, combined with national frequency allocations, usage of such devices can be prohibited in certain countries.... </p>

As well as providing service to foreign visitors, GSM's roaming capabilities will ensure that customers of one regional operator will be able roam on to any of the other regional networks. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">NewsML, NITF, PRISM, RSS, Atom, ICE, XMP, XHTML... As interest builds for standardizing news dissemination, concern also grows that specifications are being developed in isolation. How do they fit? Where will they converge? How can developers and users collaborate to identify gaps and overlaps and ensure their systems will be able to interoperate now and in the future? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The News Standards Summit will bring together major players--experts on news metadata standards as well as commercial news providers, users, and aggregators. Together, we will analyze the current state and future expectations for news and publishing XML efforts from both the content and processing model perspectives. Our goal--to increase understanding and drive practical, productive convergence.</p>
