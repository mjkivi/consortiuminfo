                By: John Blau<br>
  <strong>ITWorld.com, October 19, 2005</strong>&nbsp;--  Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are speaking out against efforts by several  countries participating in United Nations-sponsored talks to force the U.S. to  relinquish control over key Internet functions. The most recent critic is  Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican from Minnesota. Earlier this week, Coleman  submitted a resolution aimed at protecting control of the Internet, in  particular the domain name and addressing system, from being transferred to the  U.N. <a href="http://www.itworld.com/Man/2681/051019internet/">...Full Story</a></p>

  <strong>Computer Business Review Online October 14, 2005</strong>&nbsp;--  Paul Mockapetris, who invented the internet&rsquo;s domain name system, was asked a  few years ago what else he wished he could have invented. He answered: &ldquo;A  directory system for the internet that wouldn't be controlled by the  politicians, lawyers and bureaucrats.&rdquo; Tough luck, Paul. Not only is the DNS  controlled by politicians, lawyers and bureaucrats, but politicians, lawyers  and bureaucrats from all over the world have been spending vast amounts of time  and effort arguing over which politicians, lawyers and bureaucrats should  control it in future. <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/blog.asp?show=cbr/2005/10/who_really_runs.html">...Full Story</a></p>

                  <strong>Intellectual Property Watch, October 10, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- Encouragement for the use of free and open  source software and open standards for science and technology has quietly  worked its way into the draft texts being prepared for the November second  phase of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). Such ideas have  gained significant support in recent years as potentially low-cost, easy-access  solutions for developing countries, but as they are put forward in the WSIS  context they are balanced by stronger calls for proprietary approaches. The  draft WSIS texts are lengthy and detailed, and intellectual property (IP)  issues play a comparatively small role overall, but the stakes are high enough  to draw top government IP officials and industry lobbyists to the meetings. <a href="http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=98&res=800&print=0">...Full  Story</a></p>

  <strong>ZDNet.com October 21, 2005</strong>&nbsp;--  A small software developer plans to seek royalties from companies that use XML,  the latest example of patent claims embroiling the tech industry. Charlotte,  N.C.-based Scientigo owns two patents (No. 5,842,213 and No. 6,393,426)  covering the transfer of &quot;data in neutral forms.&quot; These patents, one  of which was applied for in 1997, are infringed upon by the data-formatting  standard XML, Scientigo executives assert.

                  <strong>OpenOffice.org October 21, 2005</strong>&nbsp;OpenOffice.org 2.0 is the productivity suite  that individuals, governments, and corporations around the world have been  expecting for the last two years. Easy to use and fluidly interoperable with  every major office suite, OpenOffice.org 2.0 realizes the potential of open  source. Besides a powerful new database module and advanced XML capabilities,  OpenOffice.org natively supports the internationally standardised OpenDocument  format, which several countries, as well as the U.S. state of Massachusetts,  have established as the default for office documents. More than any other  suite, OpenOffice.org 2.0 gives users around the globe the tools to be engaged  and productive members of their society. Available in 36 languages, with more  on the way, and able to run natively on Windows, GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac OS  X (X11) and several other platforms, OpenOffice.org banishes software  segregation and isolation and dramatically levels the playing field. And, with  its support for the OASIS Standard OpenDocument format, OpenOffice.org  eliminates the fear of vendor lock in or format obsolescence. The OpenDocument  format can be used by any office application, ensuring that documents can be  viewed, edited and printed for generations to come. <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/press/2.0/press_release.html">...Full Story</a></p>

  <strong>VNUnet.com October 4, 2005  --</strong>&nbsp;Sun  Microsystems has promised not to enforce any of its patents covering the  OpenDocument format. The Oasis Open Document Format for Office Applications is  a standard backed by Adobe, IBM and Sun....Sun's patent support for  OpenDocument is different from a move the company made earlier this year, in  which it pledged 1,670 patents in support of any software governed by the open  source Common Development and Distribution Licence.Simon Phipps, Sun's chief  open source officer, said: &quot;Previous attempts at patent protection using  the 'patent commons' approach glorify patents, forcing anyone who would benefit  from the apparent protection to become a patent expert. A blanket statement  like this just says: 'no need to look, you're safe.'&quot; <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2143045/sun-throws-patent-weight-behind">...Full Story</a></p>

                By: Sean Doherty<br>
  <strong>InformationWeek, October 9, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- How do you compete against Microsoft in  the office- productivity software market? You could give up, like WordPerfect  did long ago. Or you could try harder, as Sun has done. Sun Microsystem's  StarOffice 8 Office Suite gives users a similar word- and number-crunching  experience to Microsoft Office, but adheres to open standards, runs on Linux  and Solaris (as well as Windows), and costs less than $100. <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=171203641">...Full Story</a></p>

                By: Peter Judge<br>
  <strong>Techworld October 22, 2005</strong>&nbsp;The  lightweight access point protocol (LWAPP) is back from the dead. It is now the  leading proposal for multi-vendor wireless LANs, according to an IETF standards  group. In 2003, network managers wanting a wireless LAN to cover their building  were offered wireless switches as an alternative to stringing together  standalone access points. The switches were often criticised because the  &quot;thin&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; access points they used were proprietary. <a href="http://www.techworld.com/networking/news/index.cfm?NewsID=4629">...Full Story</a></p>

  <strong>BioITWorld.com, October 4, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- The Proteomics Standards Initiative  session of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) 2005 congress was opened by  the current chair, Rolf Apweiler of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory -  European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), who summarized the achievements  of the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) to date. The Molecular  Interaction XML interchange standard is already widely used, and all of the  major publicly available databases now make data available in this format [1].  Five of these databases -- BIND, DIP, IntAct, MINT, and MPact (MIPS) -- have  formed the International Molecular Exchange consortium to jointly curate and  exchange data, with data exchange commencing early in 2006. <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/newsitems/2005/sept2005/09-29-05-news-hupo">...Full Story</a></p>

                      Bio-IT World, October 28, 2005 --&nbsp; </strong>Sometime within the last year, the Interoperable  Informatics Infrastructure Consortium (I3C) quietly disappeared. Sadly,  perhaps, almost nobody noticed.&nbsp;  Researchers and vendors launched the I3C with the noble goal of  developing interoperability standards for the life sciences that would make it  easier to access, exchange, and share data&hellip;.So why did the I3C just vanish with  so little fanfare? Opinions among some of the I3C founding members vary, but  the consensus is that the work of the I3C is being carried out today in other  standards bodies. <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/newsitems/2005/oct2005/10-27-05-news-i3c?page:int=2">...Full Story</a></span> </p>
