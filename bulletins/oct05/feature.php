                      <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style2">Introduction: </span></em></strong><span class="style2"> Humanity today is facing the reality that resources are finite, as is the capacity of the world to absorb the punishment that we are inflicting upon the environment.  Having passed the point where the earth's resiliency was equal to our impact, we must now achieve an understanding of the workings of the environment that is sufficient to bring our effects back within the bounds of that resilience.  Doing so will be a matter of unparalleled complexity, and will require an endless process of data gathering, integration, modeling, regulation, and then monitoring to determine whether the desired effects have been achieved.</span>
                      <p align="left"><span class="style2">Each of these steps may require  the development of new standards, but the types of standards that will be  needed may not be the same as those that have been sufficient to address  previous challenges.&nbsp; Nor, perhaps, will  traditional standard setting organizations be appropriate to develop them. </span>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Standards have historically  addressed discrete tasks: from defining weights and measures in millennia past  to baud rates and interfaces today.&nbsp;  Because the problems these standards were created to solve were finite,  they could be (and were) useful in isolation, often needing no coherent  connection to any other standards at all, even in the case of weights and  measures, as in the chaotic, ad hoc English system that evolved over time.&nbsp; Even where such relationships were coherent,  as in the Metric system, the base ten relationships between the various weights  and measures were provided for convenience rather than out of actual  necessity.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">The creation of standards, not  surprisingly, has therefore been accomplished in discrete settings, either by  governments from the days of Hammurabi to the present, in the case of weights  and measures, or inside individual standard setting organizations in modern  times, sometimes formed to create a single specification, or at most to develop  standards for a well-delimited technical or business domain.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Today, this insular, distributed  system is already being challenged by many forces, most obviously by the  convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) within the same  network, and even the same device.&nbsp; No  longer can a single standard exist in a business and technical vacuum.&nbsp; Instead, it may be invoked by a mobile  device that may not only provide for voice communication, but also may include  camera, video, Web browsing, PDA, music and other functions as well.&nbsp; The demands for versatility on a standard  may also transcend technical compatibility issues, to involve economic and  business concerns as well.&nbsp; For example,  a standard originally designed for use in a royalty-tolerant commercial setting  may now be needed in another where royalties are not tolerable, and open source  licensing terms are mandated. </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Standards thus increasingly have  meaning within larger and more complex contexts, forcing those that create a  standard to accommodate new demands, and to re-balance the concerns that would  have been considered in defining the same type of standard only a short time  ago with ones that have only recently emerged.&nbsp;  Since convergence and innovation will continue, care will also be  demanded to anticipate the future use to which a standard may be put. </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Still, even in this broader  context, a given standard typically remains only a part of a single module  within a larger system.&nbsp; For example,  the U.S. Department of Defense desires to create a global ITC infrastructure  that will support the &quot;network centric operations&quot; of the combined  armed forces of the U.S. and its allies wherever located, anywhere in the  world.&nbsp; In this model, the data from a  single source (e.g., a battlefield sensor) would become not only accessible,  but would also identify itself, to those users out of more than a million  individuals with network access that have the credentials to receive that  particular type -- and source -- of data.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Such a vision, while imposing,  still represents the pursuit of traditional ICT standards goals writ very  large, since each of the standards required to meet this grand design needs  only to interact with other standards in time-honored ways.&nbsp; Thus, while the vision may be grand and the  task of creating such standards will become more complex, the nature of the  demands placed upon an individual specification will remain familiar.<br>
                          <br>
                        The traditional standards  infrastructure, then, has proven itself capable of scaling very  impressively.&nbsp; Doubtless it will  continue to do so, but only to meet the increasing complexity of traditional  challenges.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Today, however, significant  environmental challenges are emerging that involve multiple, changing  variables, and for which traditional static standards will prove  inadequate.&nbsp; To meet this type of need,  webs of standards that are dynamic rather than fixed will be required, with  each individual standard interconnecting with and adjusting as required by  changes in independent variables.&nbsp; Some  of these standards, rather than serving the network, would in a sense become  the network itself.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Agreeing upon and utilizing such  standards will demand a new type of infrastructure as well, requiring new types  of international relationships in order to marshal the means and the will to  tackle issues that may only be solved through determined, collaborative action.  These standards may appropriately be referred to as &quot;standards for a small  planet.&quot;</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>The need for a new type of standard:</em>&nbsp;</span> The definition of a standard has never been  static.&nbsp; From weights and measures, to  standards that achieve physical interoperability (e.g., train gauges and screw  threads), then safety (e.g., pressure standards for boilers), performance  (e.g., tensile strengths for airframe materials), and finally virtual  interoperability (e.g., radio frequencies and software interfaces), the concept  of the commonly agreed upon tools we call standards has continued to expand and  evolve.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Most of these tools, however,  could and often have incorporated somewhat arbitrarily determined  characteristics, since what was needed was any, rather than a specific standard  for a weight, or for the distance between railroad rails, or even for a radio  frequency, so long as the exact parameters chosen lay within certain bounds of  practicality.&nbsp; And most importantly,  once fixed, the utility of a standard has historically been based upon the  assumption that it would never change.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">But static standards are only useful  in unchanging circumstances.&nbsp; Indeed, a  standard relies on the assumption that the physical world and the natural laws  that govern it will not change.&nbsp; But can  such a standard be useful when the goal is in fact to change, or limit the  change, of the physical world as part of a continuing process, or must such a  standard also adjust, adapting as the desired results are achieved (or not)?</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Over the last several decades  there has been a growing appreciation that the world's resources, as well as  the earth's capacity to absorb abuse, are both finite.&nbsp; From this realization have come many new and  difficult questions that raise social, geopolitical and equitable  questions.&nbsp; If resources are finite, how  should they be allocated, and who should be entitled to make such a  judgment?&nbsp; If given actions can damage  common, global resources, or result in deleterious effects such as global  warming, how can this damage be prevented or moderated, and does one nation  have a right to influence the actions of another?&nbsp; If not, how will such restrictions be agreed upon and enforced?</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">As yet, there are no wholly  satisfactory answers to such questions when the actions required extend beyond  national boundaries, although the need for such answers grows more urgent by  the day.&nbsp; But if international consensus  on these questions could be achieved, how will we decide what specific actions  need to be taken, and how will we know whether they are working?&nbsp; And as among a variety of actions that could  be taken, would we&nbsp; be able to determine  which would be the most economical and present the most acceptable burden upon  society?</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Solving these problems will  involve ever more sophisticated modeling that will utilize available data to  project what actions will have what results (both positive and negative) on a  factor by factor basis (e.g., will carbon dioxide rise or fall if we do X?),  and, in turn, what those reactions will have on other factors (if carbon  dioxide levels can be made to fall on average by .003% between latitudes 75 and  80 north between May and June of each year, what else changes?)&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Because such downstream effects  can only be estimated, there will be a need for intensive data collection in  order to measure the effects of environmental protection actions taken in order  to learn, in part by trial and error, what effects human actions and policies  are having.&nbsp; As importantly, there will  also need to be formulae &ndash; variable standards &ndash; that utilize these data in a  feedback loop in order to indefinitely adjust regulations and policies on a  constant, periodic basis.&nbsp; These  standards will need to balance not only scientific data, but political and  economic feasibility as well, in order to determine the most expedient and  achievable means to the required ends.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">In other words, unlike traditional  standards that answer only to fixed, direct physical and cost issues, new  environmental and sustainable resource standards will need to be developed via  a process that incorporates not only scientific data, but accommodates forces  as non-empirical as arguments for social equity between developing and  developed nations &ndash; as has already been witnessed in the rancorous debate over  the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>The current state of the art:</em></strong>&nbsp; Designing such standards will involve  acquiring skills that we currently largely lack.&nbsp; While science continues to provide grater understanding of  natural processes, actual attempts to achieve sustainability have been limited  to discrete resources, such as in the management of commercial fishing stocks and  populations of game animals.&nbsp; In the  case of game, there has been reasonable success.&nbsp; But game animals can be counted in the field and at harvest, and  the legal take can be limited on an annual basis through managing the length of  seasons and the number of licenses issued.&nbsp;  Fishing stocks are harder to estimate and can be more difficult to  monitor, and the ecological webs involved within which they exist are complex  and hidden as well.&nbsp; As a result,  success to date in this area has been limited at best, and many of the forces  resulting in recoveries and declines remain largely a black box.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">The concept of sustainability  seems to have found its greatest purchase in the area of &ldquo;sustainable  development,&rdquo; which conjoins recognition of current human needs with  environmental concerns and seeks to reconcile the two in a fashion that does  justice to the needs of our descendants.&nbsp;  The concept has received the formal support of the United Nations (which  published the report of the Brundtland Commission in 1987 on this topic), as  well as recognition by several nations (for example, France acknowledged  environmental responsibility in an amendment to its constitution in 2004, as  did Poland in Article 5 of its 1997 constitution).</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Other activity has been taken by  private industry, non-governmental organizations and other non-profits.&nbsp; Examples of these efforts include  initiatives in areas such as ethical investing and enabling environmentally  responsible purchasing (e.g., certifying that lumber products have been harvested  in a sustainable, environmentally-friendly fashion).&nbsp; But since compliance with such standards is elective, their  impact has to date been limited, relegating the role of such efforts to one of  leadership rather than meaningful and systemic change.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>The role of government:</em></strong>&nbsp; It would seem obvious, then, that global  environmental and resource problems can only be solved through international  governmental action.&nbsp; The leading effort  to date in this area, of course, has been the multi-year effort to agree upon  curtailment of global warming via the negotiation and execution of the Kyoto  Protocol, which the United States has thus far declined to ratify.&nbsp; Despite this setback, the fact that  widespread agreement was achieved at all represents a hope for the future.&nbsp; And while the Federal government of the  United States has not committed the nation as a whole to comply with the Kyoto  Protocol, individual states (such as California and Massachusetts) have moved  forcefully to set environmental laws that are more strict than their Federal  analogs.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Given the near-unanimous  ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and the growing scientific consensus that  human actions are contributing to a process of global warming, it seems likely  that efforts to curtail green house gases will increase.&nbsp; With the commitment of governments comes the  possibility of affecting real change, but the question then arises of what  specific changes should be required.&nbsp; In  the short term, the obvious answer is to seek any reductions in the most pernicious  gases and substances that are politically achievable, since at this juncture in  history only a reduction, rather than the elimination, of the impact is  feasible.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">But in the long term &ndash; ten, twenty  or fifty years from today &ndash; there will need to be better and more calibrated  goals that permit the maximum environmental protection to be achieved at the  minimum economic cost.&nbsp; With more  precise measurements and understanding of industrial causes and environmental  effects, better calculations of the true avoided cost savings of various types  of actions, such as development of new alternative energy infrastructures, will  also become possible.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">The concept of such an evolution  in strategies for attacking environmental and resource challenges would be roughly  analogous to the evolution of cancer therapy in modern times.&nbsp; Following decades when surgery and radiation  were the only treatment options, the first efficacious chemical agents were  discovered.&nbsp; However, the pathology of  cancer at the cellular level was poorly understood, leading to the shotgun  application of a limited number of harsh chemotherapy regimes to all patients  that were diagnosed with a single type of cancer, identified only grossly by  the organ of origin (e.g., liver or pancreas).&nbsp;  More recently, it has become clear that in fact there are many different  variations within what were previously thought to be single types of cancer,  and that many of these varieties have unique points of vulnerability.&nbsp; With the discovery of new drugs based upon  new treatment theories derived to exploit these points of opportunity, doctors  are beginning to utilize more highly-targeted and efficacious therapies that  match a given drug regime with the specific sub-type of cancer involved.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">Working towards such a goal in the  case of resource utilization and environmental protection is neither  unreasonable nor impossible.&nbsp; Already a  variety of different greenhouse gasses have been identified, and more is  learned all the time which ones are most potent, and in what ways the various  components of the atmosphere react with each other to reach specific end  results.&nbsp; As more is learned, more  &quot;treatment options&quot; will therefore become possible, as well as the  prioritization of the benefits and costs of controlling specific agents.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">When one takes the long view  (e.g., the world that our great-grandchildren will inhabit), there is little  choice but to raise the level of restrictions on our activities until  equilibrium is reached, and ideally to work towards recovering lost ground.&nbsp; But maintaining equilibrium in a system as  complex as the earth's biosphere will be a challenge indeed.&nbsp; Even here, however, there are analogies to  be found, such as today's efforts to control national economies through the  actions (in the case of the United States) of the Federal Reserve, which  closely monitors and seeks to influence the vastly complex fluctuations of the  marketplace through a constant process of interest rate adjustments.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">As with the economy, there will  need to be regulations and standards applied that are not fixed, but  variable.&nbsp; A standard that is applied in  one year may not be appropriate for even the next, as other variables change,  or as the monitoring of causes and effects permits the refinement of the  standards and regulations being applied.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>What is to be done:</em>&nbsp;</span> If the concept of empirical and dynamic  global sustainability standards is to be pursued on a systemic basis, it would  require an effort of a magnitude and type not previously attempted, and would  involve tasks such as the following:</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Data identification</em>:&nbsp;</strong> Data of may types will be required in order  to support a growing global population on a sustaining basis.&nbsp; The following provide a representative  sample of the questions that must be answered through the gathering of such  data:</p>

                        <ul>
                          <li class="style2"><strong><em>Food resources:</em></strong>&nbsp; What is the carrying capacity of arable  land?&nbsp; What land can be utilized within  the limits of locally available water resources?&nbsp; What will be the impact of altering existing vegetation on the  carbon dioxide cycle?&nbsp; What will be the  transportation costs and energy demands of distributing this food, and what  practical limits will such costs impose on where people can live?&nbsp;</li>

                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Data acquisition and integration:</em></strong>&nbsp; Once identified by type and purpose, the  data would need to be acquired, presumably through international cooperation  and/or via new global institutions, and then integrated in a way that permits  the use of that data for multiple purposes.&nbsp;  New GIS and other standards would play a key role in this process.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Theorizing and technical modeling:</em></strong>&nbsp; When collected, the data would be utilized  to generate models that would test the effects of modifying individual  variables against all outcomes of concern (both positive and negative, on a  systemic basis).</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Economic and geopolitical  evaluation:</em>&nbsp;</strong> While the technical feasibility of modifying certain industrial outputs  would be the first step, the economic impact and geopolitical feasibility of  actually mandating such behavior would be equally vital, as would reliable,  long-term public funding, immune from the impacts of changes of  administrations.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>Achieving consensus:</em>&nbsp;</span> Once the best alternatives were identified,  they would need to be &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to the global community.&nbsp; This would involve not just buy-in to absolute goals, but  resolution of the type of issues that complicated the Kyoto process as well,  such as whether restrictions should apply equally to all nations (the U.S.  position), or should impact less developed countries less severely than nations  those that have already modernized (the Protocol&rsquo;s approach).</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Monitoring and Enforcement:</em>&nbsp;</strong> Public agreement may be more easily achieved  in the future than actual compliance.&nbsp;  Mechanisms would therefore be needed to monitor human behavior as well  as the environment.&nbsp; Contemporary experience  under existing treaties, such as the WTO and those intended to avoid nuclear  arms proliferation, indicates that this will be an ongoing challenge.&nbsp; On a positive note, such existing mechanisms  can provide a precedent for future action.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Data updating and integration:</em></strong> Monitoring the  success or failure of regulatory restrictions at achieving desired results will  be essential, because evidence of positive effects will only become clear very  slowly.&nbsp; Thus, if limits are set too low  or permitted resource utilization levels are too high, many years of damage may  become inevitable before readjustment can be agreed upon and remedial actions  take effect.&nbsp; Similarly, if controls are  set strictly, the ability to prove positive results as quickly as possible  (however minor) will be vital in order to maintain the global will to accept  such restrictions.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Standards readjustment:</em>&nbsp;</strong> Over time, the system will need to be  adjusted on a periodic, ongoing basis, as normal variables take effect (e.g.,  natural weather cycles), as global development occurs in unexpected ways (e.g.,  regional population spikes and dips), as catastrophic events (e.g., volcanic  eruptions) have temporary impacts, as new industrial processes are devised  which have new environmental effects, as data collection efforts become more  sophisticated, and as the interrelationship between variables becomes better  understood.</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>System requirements:</em>&nbsp;</span> What would be required to enable such an  effort?&nbsp; At minimum, the following:</p>
                      <div align="left">
                        <ul>
                          <li class="style2"><strong><em>Critical Mass:</em></strong>&nbsp; Participation by a sufficient number of  nations, measured by aggregate impact, would be essential in order to ensure  that the effort could be successful rather than merely symbolic.&nbsp; This participation would involve not only  the willingness to accept restrictions, but cooperation in data collection as  well.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li class="style2"><strong><em>Methodology:</em>&nbsp;</strong> Agreement would be needed on whether  globally mandated restrictions or nationally determined strategies would be  utilized.&nbsp; The answer might vary on a  problem-by-problem basis.&nbsp; For example,  a cod is a cod, but various gases contribute to a single problem, and one  nation may find one more economically palatable to curtail than another.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li class="style2"><strong><em>Authority:</em>&nbsp;</strong> The participants would need to agree to  permit international inspection and monitoring of compliance, as well as agree  to submit to sanctions for a failure to comply.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li class="style2"><strong><em>Structure (political):</em>&nbsp;</strong> Either a United Nations agency, a new treaty  organization, or a body of a wholly new design would be required to provide the  venue within which agreement could be reached and through which compliance  would be enforced.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li class="style2"><strong><em>Structure (science):</em>&nbsp;</strong> A global organization, or alliance, would be  needed to collect, integrate and update data, as well as to perform modeling  and ratify recommendations for political adoption, as well as to fine-tune the  standards derived and approved over time.&nbsp;  Ideally, a single organization (rather than each nation individually)  would perform this function and release the data upon which restrictions would  be based, to lessen the likelihood of disputes.&nbsp; Such an organization would need to be apolitical and immune from  external influence to the greatest extent possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>Structure (standards):</em>&nbsp;</span> At every step of the way, there would be the  need to identify and use existing standards, as well to create traditional and  dynamic standards for data measurement, analysis, limitations, and monitoring.&nbsp; Creating and integrating these standards  will likely require not only the creation of new standard setting  organizations, but also a level and type of cooperation between existing  standards organizations and governments that has not been required to address  historical problems.&nbsp; </li>
                        </ul>
                      </div>
                      <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Conclusions:</em></strong>&nbsp; Is such a process so Herculean as to be  unimaginable?&nbsp; The first reaction would  be to say yes.&nbsp; But the more sobering  reflection is whether we have any choice but to undertake it.&nbsp; Even if global populations were to stabilize  in the future, it is hardly probable that stasis could be achieved at a number  that is not billions higher than at present.&nbsp;  Certainly there can be no doubt that, absent significant changes in our behavior,  our existing resources and the resilience of our environment would be  insufficient to withstand the onslaught of nine billion people, each hoping to  enjoy the life style of a typical American.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">On a more hopeful note (depending  upon one's point of view), the challenge we face is not monolithic, but rather  a host of nested imbalances that need to be redressed.&nbsp; While global warming has garnered the lion&rsquo;s  share of recent headlines, there are countless smaller issues within the  over-all fractal pattern of environmental degradation and resource depletion,  from the die-off of coral reefs to the destruction of rain forests.&nbsp; Although each of these issues represents its  own set of challenges that must be understood and resolved, each also  represents its own test bed from which much generic expertise will grow and  transferable discoveries will be made in a new discipline that may come to be  known as &ldquo;sustainability science.&rdquo;</p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">As such experience does grow,  scientific tools and standards will be devised to make use of this  experience.&nbsp; Hopefully the necessary  political will and international structures will evolve as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps as the simpler challenges are  successfully addressed, public determination will grow, and the mores of  society will permanently settle into a state where maintaining sustainable  balances will become an unquestionable mandate.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p align="left" class="style2">And if not?&nbsp; That is not a question with an answer that  is pleasant to contemplate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Truly, the  credo of NASA is one that might usefully be appropriated for this effort:&nbsp; Failure is not an option.</p>
