The W3C appealed for relief, and the PTO agreed to review the offending patent. Less noticed was the release of a major report by the Federal Trade Commission, in which the FTC recommends major patent reforms.

                <p align="left" class="style2">Ask anyone whether they are satisfied with the current state of patents in the American IT world, and you are not likely to find many fans of the status quo. And how surprising can that be, given that the authority to grant patents was included by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution?<br>
                  <br>
Those who have some grey hair will be aware that the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has found the advent of high technology -- and particularly the unique nature of software -- challenging. The original spreadsheet program was launched, after all, at a time when software was not regarded as being patentable, which is in part why we are more familiar today with the brand name Excel than VisiCalc. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Once software was deemed to be worthy of patent protection, a backlog in filings built up as the PTO struggled to add staff that could understand software architecture. Many felt at that time that software patents were far too hard to obtain. Later, long delays melted away, and the first allegations that software patents were being granted too liberally arose, in connection with a feeling that examiners were still ill-equipped to evaluate them.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Several other cracks became evident in patents as applied to software as the pace of technology quickened. The very concept of a government-granted monopoly for a finite time period seemed absurd, when the period of exclusivity spanned 20 years. True, such a period remained sensible in the world of biotechnology, where drugs could have perpetual utility, and the R&amp;D and approval process could take a decade. But in the world of software, obsolescence could occur before a patent was even granted. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Later, new trends emerged: the free software and open source movements brought an almost theological challenge to the concept of exclusive ownership rights, while the granting of &quot;business methods&quot; patents on processes that people found to be obvious outraged others. Eventually, the abuse of the standards process by some participants who failed to disclose patents was added to the list. Today, many feel simply that patents are too easily obtained, and too difficult to challenge.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Where can all this lead? Unfortunately, patents are a creation of government, and therefore inertia and process are serious issues. But even as new crises arise, there is some hope for progress.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In our November News Cluster, we focus on two current events: the well-publicized Eolas victory over Microsoft, followed by the W3C's successful quest for a review by the PTO, and the barely noticed release by the Federal Trade Commission of a comprehensive report suggesting meaningful reforms to the patent system. Whether the combination of the outcry over the Eolas patent and the FTC's good work will be sufficient to spark a change remains to be seen. </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">But those that have a serious stake in the game would be wise to seize upon this opportunity to speak out in favor of a serious effort to bring the patent system up to date. Perhaps the Founding Fathers would be proud of us if we do.</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>What Price Owner's Rights in a Modern World? </em></strong>For some time there has been unhappiness over the ready availability of IT patent protection. Many have thought that the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) grants patents too easily, especially in the area of software. At the same time, those unlucky enough to become embroiled in patent infringement litigation typically face legal costs of over $1 million (and several times that, in the case of biotech patent actions). That's bad enough for someone knowingly challenging a patent, but truly punishing for someone surprised to find herself on the receiving end of an infringement suit. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Opinions on this subject have become more emotional in light of several other factors. First, it hasn't helped that many seemingly elementary (or, in patent terms, &quot;obvious&quot;) patents have been granted in the area of &quot;business methods&quot; involving ecommerce. Second, the Free Software and Open Source movements are championing fee-free accessibility to important software, such as operating systems (e.g., Linux) and core applications (e.g., Open Office). And, in fact, the open source model has broken out of the realm of true believers, and is gaining significant traction in the commercial marketplace. Finally, in the ever more connected world in which we live, it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop standards that can be implemented without incurring the obligation to pay royalties or other fees. All in all, there are more people feeling hostile to IT patent rights now than ever before. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But to return to the question of whether patent's are too easy to obtain: In this author's experience, it is almost unheard of for a patent asserted against a standard not to be viewed by engineers (at least) as having been conclusively anticipated by one or more pre-existing discoveries, research papers or patent claims (so called &quot;prior art&quot;, under patent law). Since inventions that have been &quot;anticipated by prior art&quot; are not entitled to patent protection, there is an immediate expression of outrage in such situations. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In truth, given examples of prior art can have a different significance under the complex legal analysis of patent law than they may present to an engineer from a technical point of view. But nonetheless, more and more people have come to believe that something is out of balance, and needs to be corrected. A number of developments occurring this fall highlight the situation -- and hold out some hope of reform. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Eolas v. Microsoft: Comptons' Redux. </em></strong>The first development is the ongoing outcry over the patent litigation victory of a one-man software company called Eolas over industry behemoth Microsoft. Recently, Eolas won a $512 million judgment over Microsoft. The suit involves a patent that describes a system that launches an application within a Web page. The verdict upset a far wider audience than Microsoft however, since the patent would represent the first royalty cloud that might shadow an important element of normal Web usage. In response, the W3C issued strong protests, as well as an appeal to the Patent and Trademark Office seeking a reexamination of the Eolas patent. Not long afterwards, the PTO granted the request. Hearings are now pending. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">For those with long memories, all of this will have a familiar ring. It was at Comdex in 1993 that a company called Compton's New Media made an announcement that landed like a bombshell on the nascent multimedia industry. At the show, Compton's revealed that it had just been granted a patent that would allow it to levy a royalty on a broad swath of multimedia applications, including those based on CDs, which were then coming into their own. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">At that time, Multimedia was being hailed as the Next Big Thing, and with modem speeds under 2500 baud, this new technology was wholly dependent on CDs for content delivery and access. As a result, the industry besieged the PTO, demanding a review of the newly awarded patent, and citing prior art to support its case. The PTO agreed to conduct a review, and ultimately the patent was rescinded after public hearings were held. Many were left with a somewhat queasy feeling that the PTO had caved to public pressure (could the patent have, in fact, been valid?) Smarting from the outcome, the PTO vowed to reform the system, in order to prevent future such fiascos. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Would a Recission of the Eolas Patent be Good News or Bad? </em></strong>How should we feel about the rapid response of the PTO to the W3C's call for review of the Eolas patent? The good news for Web surfers is that a non-fee resolution to the issue may be on the horizon. But at the same time, is this any way to run a patent system? After all, Microsoft (no slouch in the legal department) failed to successfully challenge the patent in court. So will justice be served by the PTO intervening? And would those involved in a less-public patent have been able to gain a review by the PTO? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Of course, if the PTO rescinds the patent, the legal expense and the uncertainty that the case has unleashed on the marketplace will have been considerable. Many companies and the W3C will have experienced a great diversion of resources and distraction from other business as a result of what would prove to have been an inappropriately granted patent. In that light, a rescission by the PTO can scarcely be considered to be unmitigated good news. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>The FTC Weighs in. </em></strong>While the Eolas litigation was playing out, a different process was unfolding in Washington D.C. During the first half of 2002, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) were holding extensive joint hearings on antitrust and other aspects of intellectual property, including the patent system and the process of standard setting. The hearings extended for over 24 days, during which more than 300 commercial, legal, technical and academic experts (including this author) gave testimony. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Now, the first of two reports has been issued by the FTC (the FTC and the DOJ plan to also issue a joint report on antitrust issues). The FTC report focuses almost exclusively on the reform of the patent system, and is entitled &quot; <em>To Promote Innovation: the Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy </em>&quot;. Fortunately for those with a less than avid appetite for the subject, the 315-page report is accompanied by a more accessible, 18 page Executive Summary. Included in the FTC's findings are conclusions such as this: &quot;Questionable patents are a significant competitive concern and can harm innovation.&quot; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In its report, the FTC offers a broad range of specific recommendations for reform. Several are dramatic, and are based upon systemic flaws that the FTC finds in the PTO. For example, the report notes that examiners on average spend only 8 to 25 hours on each patent application, thereby limiting the amount of time an examiner can spend seeking and evaluating prior art. This should not be a surprise, given that the PTO receives over 1,000 new applications a day, and is under the same budget pressures as any other Federal agency. Further stacking the deck in favor of patent approval, however, is the fact that court cases have held that examiners are to look for reasons why a patent should not issue, rather than establishing the qualifications that would entitle an application to be approved at all (in other words, an application is presumed to be valid unless a reason can be found by the examiner to the contrary). </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Of course, even with more time and different standards, mistakes would still be made by the PTO. The FTC accordingly based some of its recommendation on the acceptance that &quot;The PTO works under a number of disadvantages that can impede its ability to reduce the issuance of questionable patents.&quot; As a result, the FTC also focused on the question of how difficult it should be to challenge a patent once it has been issued. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">While some of the FTC's recommendations (15 in all, counting &quot;sub recommendations&quot;) involve finer points of the patent process, some are fundamental, including the following: </p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                    <li class="style2">That legislation be enacted that would create a new administrative procedure to allow post-grant review of, and opposition to, patents. </li>
                    <li class="style2">That the legal standard required to overturn a patent be reduced from a showing of &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; in support of rescission to a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; (from a legal point of view, the reduction in the burden of proof is significant, and would make it easier to defend against charges of infringement when a dubious patent is asserted against another party) </li>
                    <li class="style2">Tighten the legal standards used to evaluate whether a patent is &quot;obvious&quot;. </li>
                    <li class="style2">Increase the PTO's funding. </li>
                    <li class="style2">Increase the authority of patent examiners to query applicants more extensively, including as regards prior art. </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>What Next? </em></strong>Of course, most of the reforms recommended by the FTC are directly or indirectly dependent on Congressional action, either legislatively or as regards increasing the budget of the PTO. It is hardly likely that Congress will place the FTC recommendations at the top of its agenda, or that ready, willing and able Congressional sponsors will easily be found to sponsor necessary legislation. In this light, the FTC report is therefore likely best seen as a first step towards raising, and legitimating, the dialogue on the topic of patent reform. Hopefully, the FTC's worthwhile efforts will succeed in doing so. <br>

              <p align="left"><span class="style42">[] [] [] November 11, 2003 -</span><span class="style2"> In the course of doing research for a Friend of the Court brief in support of Infineon's (unsuccessful) Supreme Court bid, I came across an article that appeared in The Economist some ten years ago. As I read it, I was struck by the degree to which the world has changed since the bad old days of proprietary systems -- when everyone talked about open standards (but no one really meant it) -- to the present time, where we utilize a host of standards that truly permit devices of diverse manufacture to interoperate. But how different are things today, really? </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Ten years ago, a business was a DEC shop, or a Data General shop, or a Thinking Machines shop (obviously, a number of other things have changed along the way as well). Today, while we have not achieved true platform freedom, we do have examples of vast wide area interconnectivity, courtesy of the Internet and telecommunications. And new standards-based initiatives, such as the storm of activity in the area of Web services, promise to bring us closer to even the goal of pervasive cross-platform interoperability. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But have things really changed, or are today's standards efforts, like Clausewitz's definition of diplomacy, simply the pursuit of war by other means? And if so, are we better off, or just treading water? </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">For some insight into those questions, let's go back ten years to that ancient article in <em>The Economist</em>, which stated:</p>
              <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">Every firm wants a monopoly--and every firm wants to call it an open standard. The noisiest of...competitive battles will be about standards...[I]n the computer industry, new standards can be the source of enormous wealth, or the death of corporate empires. With so much at stake, standards arouse violent passions. Much of the propaganda pumped out by individual firms is aimed at convincing customers and other firms that their product has become a &quot;standard&quot;. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Well, we've largely moved on from that specific type of competitive behavior. Most vendors now realize that becoming the next Microsoft is simply not in the cards. But that doesn't mean that everyone is willing to hop into the same sandbox and create open standards in a pure spirit of cooperation. Not even with adult supervision. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">No, the search for competitive advantage has simply switched from trying to establish one's own proprietary technology as &quot;the standard&quot; to trying to control the process whereby the standard is set. But, as with diplomacy, controlling the process of standard setting requires more art and less blunt force than either war or establishing proprietary systems as de facto standards. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Happily, trying to blatantly control the creation of a standard is comparatively difficult to pull off in the context of a collaborative process. After all, as observed in the same article in <em>The Economist</em>, &quot;...most multi-firm efforts have failed for the simple reason that the participating firms cannot trust each other.&quot; But today, many new business opportunities simply can't exist without standards, so that lack of trust means that everyone is looking at everyone else very closely. Even the press has found story lines in the standards games that companies play, to the point where standards development has gone from the status of chloroform in print to the subject matter of investigative journalism. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">So let's return one last time to <em>The Economist</em> to see how much the world has really changed. In February of 1993, the authors used Unix as an example of how agreeing on truly open standards was an inherently lost cause:</p>
              <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">There are now many rival versions of Unix sponsored by various firms from IBM to Sun Microsystems, all of which are, to a significant degree, incompatible with one another, although all are promoted as open....In fact, widespread adoption of a single firm's product is the only way truly open standards have been established in the new computer industry....In December Novell bought Unix Systems Laboratories from AT&amp;T and 11 minority shareholders, with the obvious intent of making Unix an alternative standard to whatever is offered by Microsoft. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Where to begin to bring that one up to date? Unix is back with a vengeance -- but no longer in a proprietary uniform, with Novell owning the One True Version. Instead, its new face is the innocent penguin of Linux, an operating system that is not only open, but created by an entirely new standard-setting process, involving independent, individual programmers (at least initially), rather than corporate giants. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">So it is that a confederacy of David's, and not Novell, is finally threatening the Goliath of Redmond. Novell itself is hoping to ride the open coattails of the operating system that it once owned, long after abandoning its effort to turn that same operating system into its next Netware-type monopoly. With Novell's acquisitions of Ximian and SuSE, it is basing its future on the success of an orphaned operating system that made good on the streets, after surviving life in a series of corporate foster homes. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Almost the stuff of a made-for-TV movie. Perhaps a decade can make a big difference after all. </p>

              <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">In fact, Clausewitz's varied usage of Politik and the historical context within which he wrote indicate that he meant three things by the term. First, Clausewitz did intend Politik to mean policy, the extension of the will of the state, the decision to pursue a goal, political or otherwise. Second, Politik also meant politics as an external state of affairs, the strengths and weaknesses provided to a state by its geo-political position, its resources, alliances and treaties, and as an ongoing process of internal interaction between a state's key decision-making institutions and the personalities of its policy makers. Lastly, Clausewitz used Politik as an historically causative force, providing an explanatory pattern or framework for coherently viewing war's various manifestations over time. </p>

PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option. PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and simple detection of common transmission errors. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms.

              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong>Geneva, 7 November 2003 - </strong> The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has reached agreement on a new global standard that quadruples capacity of the optical transmission systems which link the nodes of telecommunication networks. The new standard, which allows a transmission speed of 40 Gbit/s, has been developed for carriers to be able to bring down the cost per bit (of data carried) and the costs of network maintenance and management. The standard - ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1 - increases the capacity for optical interfaces from the present maximum of 10 Gbit/s to 40 Gbit/s. The completed work goes hand-in-hand with other work by ITU in optical transport networks, which encourage a fair market for manufacturers and operators, and ultimately encourages better service for consumers. It is already finding it's way into optical interfaces developed to exploit the demand for high capacity Internet routers. The standard follows extensive field trials between a number of service providers and manufacturers.</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong>Geneva, 5 November 2003 -- </strong>TU delegates from government and industry have agreed on a new global standard that will allow network operators to increase the capacity of optical fibre. The standard, created in response to industry needs, was developed under ITU's fast track approval process &mdash; AAP (Alternative Approval Process). The standard &mdash; ITU-T Recommendation G.695 &mdash; applies to a technology called Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM), used most often in metropolitan networks. In today's cost-conscious telecommunications market CWDM is seen as a cheaper and simpler alternative to DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing). Less expensive uncooled lasers may be used in CWDM products because of wide channel spacing. These lasers require less precise wavelength control, as well as lower-cost passive components. Experts estimate that carriers with sufficient deployed fibre could make savings of up to 30 per cent deploying a CWDM solution compared with the DWDM alternative </p>

Open source software represents a serious alternative to proprietary products, and should be used as a tool to open up software markets to more competition, according to a report carried out under the auspices of the Danish government. The report, which stirred up controversy when it was published in Denmark earlier this month, was released in English this week by the Danish Board of Technology. While a number of governments in Europe and elsewhere are eyeing open source software as a way of cutting costs and stimulating localised software development, the Danish study goes a step further, arguing that public sector support for open-source and open standards may be necessary for there to be any real competition in the software market....The study recommended that governments take an active role in promoting standardised file formats and alternatives to dominant proprietary applications in order to help break a &quot;de facto monopoly&quot;. &quot;The ordinary market conditions for standard software will tend towards a very small number of suppliers or a monopoly,&quot; the Board of Technology stated in the report. &quot;It will only be possible to achieve competition in such a situation by taking political decisions that assist new market participants in entering the market.&quot; </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong>eWEEK, October 28, 2003 -- </strong>While still in its infancy, radio frequency identification technology is gaining momentum in business and now with the federal government. The Department of Defense last week instituted a policy to require its suppliers to install radio frequency identification (RFID) tags on individual parts and pallets by 2005, a federal stamp of approval on the technology. The tags will enable an operator to wirelessly scan a package for asset management and tracking data. This move by the military follows on the heels of the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which recently decided to require RFID from its suppliers by January 2005. Currently, the military mandate requires that radio frequency (RF) tags be installed at both the crate and pallet level, not on individual items, according to DOD spokeswoman Marcia Klein. The agency will work with its almost 24,000 suppliers to deploy the individual tags and the systems to monitor and analyze the data.

As a result of this economic influence, requirements adopted by the government can affect the uptake of standards in the private sector as well (see the &quot;Story Updates&quot; above for another example of this dynamic). On the other hand, one advantage to private sector standards bodies is that they generally can work faster than legislative bodies. Sometimes Congress will take advantage of a voluntary standard created by a consensus process, using it as the basis for a law or regulation.

              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong>NIST, November 3, 2003 -- </strong> Computer scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released on Nov. 3 an initial public draft of <em>Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems </em> (NIST SP 800-53). The publication, which details controls that will become mandatory for most federal systems in 2005, is expected to have a wide audience beyond the federal government. NIST invites public comments on the new draft guidelines for three months. The agency will hold an open, public workshop in March 2004 to share comments and discuss possible revisions to the draft. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong>ANSI, October 29, 2003 -- </strong>In the age of instantaneous communication and automated teller machines, consumers often find themselves perplexed to be waiting days for a check to clear. Banks are currently required by law to physically transmit original paper checks between financial institutions for processing....This cumbersome delay was answered when Congress recently passed a Conference Report on HR 1474, otherwise known as the &ldquo;Check 21 Act,&rdquo; which was signed into law by President Bush on October 28, 2003. HR 1474, now Public Law #108-100, will permit electronic checks to legally substitute their original paper copies in order to expedite processing. Rather than waiting for a check to be physically transported to the original institution and back, the information would be transmitted electronically...The electronic check clearing standards originated with the ANSI Accredited X9 Committee. X9 develops and publishes voluntary, consensus technical standards for the financial services industry, in the areas of check processing, electronic check exchange, PIN management and security, financial industry use of data encryption, and wholesale funds transfer, among others. </p>

  Legal Strategy in the Aftermarket Industries <br>
              </span><span class="style2">By Peter Moldave </span> </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2"> <strong>Technology Law Bulletin </strong> -- The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibits technological devices that assist in the circumvention of copyright access controls. This &ldquo;anti-circumvention&rdquo; prohibition was enacted to prevent the manufacture of devices that could be used to circumvent &ldquo;digital locks&rdquo; on copyrighted materials such as books, films and music that are sold in digital form. However, a case decided early this year raises significant concerns about the ability of companies to use the DMCA not just to prevent the copying of music or other copyrighted media, but to use technology to lock-in consumers in order to prevent aftermarket competition. </p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="style2"><strong>IDG News Service, October 30, 2003 -- </strong>A ruling this week from the U.S. Copyright Office could strengthen manufacturer Static Control Components Inc.'s (SCC's) defense against a copyright infringement lawsuit by Lexmark International Inc. that is expected to have a broad impact on the market for low-cost, third-party printer cartridges. SCC, in Sanford, North Carolina, makes computer chips that allow manufacturers to create clones of toner cartridges used in Lexmark printers. Lexmark sued SCC last year, charging that SCC's chips include copyright Lexmark computer code and violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's (DMCA) ban on circumventing digital technology that protects copyright material. Without taking a position on whether SCC's chips illegally incorporate Lexmark code, the Copyright Office ruled that the DMCA does not block software developers from using reverse engineering to circumvent digital protection of copyright material if they do so to achieve interoperability with an independently created computer program. </span></p>
