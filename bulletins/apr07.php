				<p>Governments are increasingly aware that the Internet and the Web are reordering the relationship of both citizens and governments to information and services, with both becoming more dependent upon the way in which this "cyberinfrastructure" evolves and is managed.  Governments are now deciding whether, and how, to influence this process, and the choices they make will have an important impact on the public interest.   <br><a href="http://consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/pdf/apr07/editorial.pdf">Print this article</a></p>

				<p><strong>FEATURE ARTICLE: </strong><a href="#feature"><b>ICT  STANDARD  SETTING  TODAY:  A  SYSTEM  UNDER  STRESS</b></a></p>
				<p>The modern standards development infrastructure is largely the product of the industrial age, and evolved to address the needs of such an economy.  The advent of the Internet and the Web, and the continuing introduction of new ICT-based products and services in ever shorter product cycles, are exposing the fact that a system that retains strong roots in the 19th century is ill-suited to meet the demands of the 21st.   <br><a href="http://consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/pdf/apr07/feature.pdf">Print this article</a></p>

				<h4>EDITOR'S NOTE:</h4>
				<h3>WHAT NEXT?</h3>
				<p>Mr. Natural, the eponymous hero of R.Crumb's <em>Zap Comix!</em> was wont to recommend, "<em>Always use the right tool for the job!</em>"  These are wise words, and ones that raise the question of whether the standard setting infrastructure we have today is the one we need for the future.</p>
				<p>That's the subject of this issue, as well as the question of what role, if any, government should play in helping to retool standard setting mechanisms to ensure that the needs of society are properly represented and addressed.  In some countries, government participation in such a reexamination would be expected and natural.  But in the United States, it would run counter to the historical role that government has played.  To date, Congress has acted through its regulatory powers primarily in areas of safety and health, and left information and communications technology (ICT) standards largely in the hands of private industry.</p>
				<p>But as the Internet and the Web play a larger and more important role in our lives, questions begin to arise over whether the public interest needs to figure more prominently in how these resources further evolve.  The recent public debate over "Internet equality" is one example of how this realization is beginning to dawn.  In some cases, as with open document formats, such ICT-based debates have involved standards as well.  </p>
				<p>I begin my analysis of these issues in my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong>, which asks whether government should lead, follow, or simply get out of the way, and conclude that in at least some areas, governments will have little choice but to become involved.  I reach this conclusion because private industry is not sufficiently motivated to address the interests of those parties (such as consumers) that currently largely lack a seat at the standard setting table.</p>
				<p>In this month's <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong>, I review the ways in which the current standard setting infrastructure, which evolved to meet the needs of an industrial economy, is inadequate to meet the needs of a world based increasingly upon ICT.  I suggest that this structure is a system under stress, and lacks an obvious means of evolving sufficiently to address the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
				<p>In my selection from the <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> for this month I focus on a different and highly distributed weak link in the standards infrastructure &ndash; us.  Despite the fact that the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed a suite of standards able to render Web sites much more accessible to those with physical disabilities, the use of these standards to date is woefully low.  I regret that this is true for this site as well, and hope to be able to rectify this failing in the future.</p>
				<p>In my <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> essay for this month I depart from this issue's theme to highlight the relationship between the imprecise natural language standards we use every day to describe variable qualities, such as shades of light and dark, and the more precise ones that standard setting organizations create for every variable, including even "slipperiness."</p>
				<p>And finally, I provide an announcement of a meeting that I am helping to organize and present in June, in an effort to address some of the issues discussed in this issue.  That meeting will be the third annual gathering of representatives of both consortia and accredited standard setting bodies.  The goal is to engage in a highly interactive exchange of ideas and experiences that will lead to a more structured and ongoing avenue of communication between these two essential arms of the standard setting infrastructure. </p>
				<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this issue.</p>

				<h3>CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE<br>AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST</h3>
				<p class="center"><a href="http://www.lpu.com/attorneys/updegrove.shtml">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
				<p>Over the last several months I have spoken at conferences and symposia in places as widely dispersed as Washington and Cambridge, Beijing and New Haven.  In each case, the topic was the intersection of standards and the public interest, comprehending new concepts such as the "knowledge commons" and the increasing importance of "cyberinfrastructure."  The issues we discussed included government's responsibility to utilize appropriate standards to safeguard the future of public documents, and the best way to ensure that the promise of information and communications technologies (ICT) is fulfilled in developing nations.  These gatherings have been held under the auspices of institutions as diverse as the National Academies and the United Nations Development Programme, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the United States &ndash; European Commission Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, and the Law Schools of Harvard and Yale Universities. </p>
				<div class="calloutleft">
					<p>Whether government should incline towards leading, following or simply getting out of the way [in standard setting] is a matter upon which there are likely to be strongly held differences of opinion.  How well government chooses among those roles, and how well it executes when it chooses to lead, will likely have a profound impact on our lives in the years ahead.</p>
				</div>
				<p>The fact that so many people are meeting in so many venues to discuss standards in non-technical contexts evidences the realization that something new and important is at work here.  And the fact that many of these conferences are taking place in academic and government venues suggests that people are still trying to figure out what it's all about.</p>
				<p>At the most basic level, what's under the microscope is the increasing influence and importance of the Internet and the Web.  Unlike previous telecommunications and information technology advances, each of which offered incremental improvements in one discipline or the other, the Internet and the Web represent not only giant leaps forward in both information and communications technologies, but also the convergence of both in a way that profoundly impacts the relationship of the individual to almost everything, including public information, employment opportunities, government services, and the most personal and private of information.</p>

				<p>As a result, the attention of government is commanded in almost every way: as a consumer of technology, as a provider of services to its citizens, as the guarantor of equal access and opportunity, as the regulator of telecommunications and content, as the ultimate arbiter of intellectual property rights, and so on, down through seemingly infinite and more subtle levels of impact.  It's all very complex, and government is only just beginning to wrestle with many of the consequences &ndash; such as "off shoring," a word, as well as a threat to domestic jobs, that would not exist without the Internet.</p>
				<p>At the heart of these new developments lie a variety of standards, from Internet numbers, names and protocols, to open document formats, to language and character codes.  In the past, when new ICT innovations emerged, the standards upon which they relied lay far below the level of political and public notice.  Now, they have often become the subject of public debate (there are open document bills pending in the legislatures of four US states) as well as international trade disputes (China continues to promote its WAPI standard for domestic use over WiFi) and even foreign relations (the ICANN dispute remains unresolved).</p>
				<p>More fundamentally, governments are beginning to realize that perhaps the Internet really has changed everything, at least for them, and that standards represent one of the elements they are going to have to deal with as they begin to grapple with what to do about their new responsibilities.  How will they deal with financial and medical data breaches?  What can they do to ensure that first responders will be able to communicate the next time that terrorists strike in the Homeland, and how will the refugees of the next Katrina be able to access their electronic medical records?  And what must governments do to ensure that public records will be available in fifty years, if they no longer maintain paper archives?   </p>
				<p>All of these questions, and many more, can only be solved (at least in part) through the development and management of standards.  But who will set those standards?  How can governments ensure that they are created?  Does it matter who sets them, and who should have a say in their creation?  Should government stand aside, or should they play a role in their development?  If government should be involved, should its role be as a leader, a participant, a catalyst, a funding source or a regulator?</p>
				<p>This dialogue is only beginning, and to date the United States government itself has most often been peripherally, and reactively involved.  In the case of ICANN, it has responded more politically than analytical.  With respect to first responder standards, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has perhaps acted more productively than the government agencies directly involved.  Data breaches?  Private industry has been more proactive, through the formation of consortia such as the Cyber Security Industry Alliance and, more recently, the PCI Security Standards Council.  Privacy?   Europe has acted more quickly and aggressively.  Open document standards?   Nothing is happening in Congress, but bills to mandate the use of open formats have been filed in four US States, and the Executive Agencies of Massachusetts began converting to open formats in January of this year.  Several national governments in Europe have, or are moving in the same direction.</p>
				<p>Whether government should incline towards leading, following or simply getting out of the way is a matter upon which there are likely to be strongly held differences of opinion.  It's also likely, though, that government will not have the luxury of opting for the third choice in some of the areas just mentioned.  How well government chooses among those roles, and how well it executes when it chooses to lead, will likely have a profound impact on our lives in the years ahead.</p>
				<p>Hopefully it will choose wisely, and execute well.</p>

				<h3>THE W3C, ACCESSIBILITY AND THE WEB:<br />A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
				<p><span class="blogdate">Date:  April 13, 2007</span><br>Views: 1,753</p>

				<img class="imgright" src="/images/csb_200704_earth.jpg" alt="Earth / Globe" height="80" width="80" border="0">
				<p>Human beings have an astonishing capacity to take the most incredible innovations for granted almost as soon as they begin to enjoy them.  A less attractive feature of human nature is our ability to forget (and even not care) that others may not enjoy those same advantages. Sometimes, those that are disadvantaged in this way may indeed lose ground as we gain new conveniences and privileges.</p>
				<p>So it is with the Web, because those that are less fortunate may lose access to traditional services as they migrate to this new platform.</p>
				<p>As a result, I have tried to do my part to focus attention on a regular basis on Web and IT accessibility issues, in all their many forms (a recent example is <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070307134445160">here</a>).  Happily, the media is paying closer attention to equal IT access, if only because advocates of the rights of  those with physical abilities have sought to make accessibility issues more visible. A recent example of such public attention was the focus in Massachusetts on accessibility in connection with the adoption of ODF.  More broadly, the <a href="http://www.itu.int/wsis/index.html">World Summit on the Information Society</a> (WSIS), a multi-year initiative launched under the auspices of the United Nations, has sought to promote Internet and Web accessibility on a global basis.</p>
				<p>To the general public, hardware and software economic roadblocks to Third World equality of access are easy to understand, and thus the worthwhile work of the <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a> initiative justifiably receives wide attention.  But there are many other initiatives that have been, and continue to be, pursued largely outside public notice.  These projects address much more basic infrastructural challenges, and therefore appear less "interesting" to the general public. Yet without this important work, true global equality of Internet and Web access would not only be economically challenging to achieve, but technically impossible as well.</p>
				<p>These initiatives range from the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20061017163856508">Unicode</a> (which seeks to encode, and therefore make machine readable and convertible, all current and historical character sets), to <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/blog.php?ID=46">language codes</a> (which identify the thousands of current and extinct languages for similar purposes), to the many <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=2006072910244854&">accessibility initiatives</a> surrounding ODF.   I'm pleased that the Linux Foundation, of which I am a director, is also doing its part, through its Accessibility Working Group.  That initiative is dedicated to developing free and open accessibility standards to enable comprehensive universal access to computer systems, applications, and services.  And so on, up, down and across all of the many levels of IT infrastructure that continue to expand and become more complex on a daily basis.</p>
				<p>One of the leaders in such efforts has long been the W3C, which has launched accessibility projects of many types for much of its existence.  Unlike most large consortia, which tend to be driven primarily by commercial interests that focus on market opportunities rather than market equalities, the W3C has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to ensuring that the fruits of its labors are accessible to all, regardless of physical abilities, culture, language or geographic location.  This is crucial work, and is a tribute to the values that Tim Berners-Lee and others at the W3C have inculcated in that organization.</p>
				<p>The text that I've pasted in below is Robin Cover's extract from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/NOTE-i18n-html-tech-lang-20070412/">W3C announcement</a> (taken from Robin's invaluable <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/newsletter.html">XML Daily Newslink</a> emails).  This item provides a good example of the quiet but important work that is ongoing at the W3C and a small number of other organizations, and the degree of technical attention that achieving universal accessibility requires.  Billions of people around the world will share in the benefits of work such as this &ndash; and yet few of those that benefit are likely to ever know to whom they owe a well-deserved expression of appreciation.</p>
				<p>Before moving on, I'd like to highlight one section of the W3C announcement, because it highlights the fact that you and I have an opportunity &ndash; and a responsibility &ndash; to do our part as well.  Enabling accessibility at the standards level will prove to be a wasted effort if Web site developers and owners do not take advantage of the good work of the W3C and others:</p>
				<blockquote>This document provides guidance for developers of HTML that enables support for international deployment.  Enabling international deployment is the responsibility of all content authors, not just localization groups or vendors, and is relevant from the very start of development.</blockquote>
				<p class="center">The W3C has done its part. Now it's our turn to do ours. </p>
				<p class="center">* * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
				<p class="center"><strong>Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML and HTML Content</strong><br />Richard Ishida (ed), W3C Technical Report</p>
				<p>Members of the W3C Internationalization Core Working Group have published "Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML and HTML Content" as a Working Group Note. The document is part of a series and written for HTML content authors working with XHTML 1.0, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, and CSS. Specifying the language of content is useful for a wide number of applications, from linguistically sensitive searching to applying language-specific display properties. In some cases the potential applications for language information are still waiting for implementations to catch up, whereas in others, such as detection of language by voice browsers, it is a necessity today. </p>
				<p>On the other hand, adding markup for language information to content is something that can and should be done today.  Without it, it will not be possible to take advantage of any future developments. Applications already exist that can use information about the natural language (i.e., the human, non-programmatic language) of content to deliver to users the most relevant information or styling, based on their language preferences. The more content is tagged and tagged correctly, the more useful and pervasive such applications will become.  Language information is useful for things such as authoring tools, translation tools, accessibility, font selection, page rendering, search, and scripting.  These applications can't work, however, if the information about the language of the text is not available. Language information should therefore be specified for the page as a whole, and wherever language changes within the page. In the future there will be other applications for language information, driven by developments in technology. For example, implementations of the CSS3 ':first-letter' pseudo-element will need language information to apply correct styling.</p>

				<h3><span class="red">#48</span> The Slippery (and Colorful) Business of Standards</h3>
				<p>The recent announcement of a new standard for "slipperiness" reminded me not only of the seemingly infinite, and at times surprising, types of standards we find we cannot live without, but also of the linkage between language and standards.  </p>
				<p>The standard in question was developed by the Entertainment Services and Technology Association (ESTA), one of those worthy standards development organizations that may somehow have escaped your notice to date.  According to the <a href="http://www.esta.org/">ESTA Web site</a>, its core mission is "Building the Business of Show Business," and in support of that quest, its Floors Working Group developed what it calls <em>BSR E1.34-200x, Entertainment Technology - Measuring and Specifying the Slipperiness of Floors Used in Live Performance Venues.</em></p>
				<div class="calloutleft">
					<p>One might wonder whether it is more surprising that the world has existed so long without a way to measure the slipperiness of the floors of live performance venues, or that someone has now taken the time and effort to plug that remarkably small gap (odds are that your wonder may incline towards the latter).  </p>
				</div>
				<p>If one were so inclined, one might wonder whether it is more surprising that the world has existed so long without a way to measure the slipperiness of the floors of live performance venues, or that someone has now taken the time and effort to plug that remarkably small gap (odds are that your wonder may incline towards the latter).  Still, as noted in the announcement, "It is axiomatic that you can't manage what you can't measure," and if you're in the Business of Building Show Business, I guess it's quite plausible that you might find yourself in need of managing the slipperiness of live performance venues as well.</p>
				<p>All snarkiness aside (or mostly aside, anyway), the same announcement notes that slipperiness standards already exist to ensure that "firemen don't slip off fire engine steps and that pedestrians don't lose their footing."  Fair's fair, then, say I, and I for one feel compelled to agree that it was high time for <em>someone</em> to "deal with the concerns of performers trying to dance or to do some other unusual movement in front of an audience."  Viewed from that perspective, slipperiness is certainly something I'd want someone to be managing if I was at risk of tumbling arse over tin cups in front of a few hundred people.</p>
				<p>More to the point of this on-line venue, however, is the fact that standards provide a way to quantify individual perceptions, the better to intelligibly communicate and share those perceptions to achieve mutually desirable results.  And as this announcement indicates, while everyday language is adequate to categorize qualities in a very general way, it is rarely useful to do so in a highly precise manner.</p>
				<p>Still, natural language does use words in the nature of quantitative standards all the time.  If that sounds like an odd contention to make, then this would be an ideal time for me to invite you to Consider This:</p>
				<p>Language is by purpose descriptive, and successful in that regard in an analog sort of way.  Let's use a simple example to make this point, starting with one of the simplest of distinctions:</p>
				<p>&lt;<em>Black</em> or <em>White</em>&gt;</p>
				<p>Not much need for a standard to draw this absolute distinction.  But not much information can be conveyed by so narrow a range of alternatives, either, because we are restricting ourselves to a binary situation, offering only two choices.  So now let's expand the field of opportunity a bit, and change our field to read as follows:</p>
				<p>&lt;the range of <em>Black</em> to <em>White</em>&gt;</p>
				<p>Now we have an infinite number of gradations between the two binary extremes.  But how can we manage that range so that we can make use of this new opportunity?  One way, as noted in the slipperiness announcement, is by measuring it, but natural language doesn't lend itself well to that.  We can make some progress by using words of comparison, as in:</p>
				<p>&lt;<em>This</em> is darker (or lighter) than <em>that</em>&gt;</p>
				<p>That's a bit better, but only if all you want to know is whether A is darker or lighter than B, rather than just how light or dark A actually is.  If we want to know the latter, then we still need a broader choice of words to work with &ndash; and these can rightly be referred to as standards, broadly so called.  For example, we are already familiar with this range of descriptors:</p>
				<p>&lt;<em>Black, Dark Gray, Gray, Light Gray</em> and <em>White</em>&gt;</p>
				<p>While one might quibble that each individual element is "just the name of a color," when viewed together they can be seen to be the common language equivalents of, for example, the wattage of light bulbs, with words corresponding to numbers.  After all, the sequence of 40, 60, 75, 90 and 150 (the common light bulb wattages) provides exactly the same number of alternatives in bulbs as we used words to describe the range of shades above.  In the case of the shades from light to dark, though, we use words for cultural reasons to describe our visual perceptions rather than numbers - and thank heavens for that.</p>
				<p>If we were to use numbers, though, it might be more obvious to us that we are in fact using a performance standard to measure the amount of color we perceive when we look at something (black, after all, being the name we give to a surface that absorbs all of the frequencies of the visible light spectrum, while white is the "color" we see when all such light is reflected).</p>
				<p>For most purposes, the five words noted above will suffice.  And this is fortunate, because natural language becomes less useful when it is required to become more granular, because we lack a vocabulary of comparatives that is more than superficial (where does one go after "very light gray?").  In consequence, we may be forced to resort to metaphors, rather than comparatives, but that only helps us be a bit more specific at the extremes ( we know what is meant by the words "slow as a tortoise" and "fast as a bat out of hell," but metaphors don't arise naturally to fill in the space between).</p>
				<p>Still, if you were picking paint colors, you would find that for marketing purposes the paint manufacturer will have provided more or less arbitrary names for the dozens of shades of gray it offers, in addition to its own numerical lot numbers.  And it's likely that it will be those names, and not the lot numbers, that you will use to communicate your final selection to the paint clerk.  Anyone that has viewed the sometimes ludicrously lush names of paint samples might appreciate the virtues of these numerical identifiers, especially if they are sequential rather than arbitrary.  But it's still more likely that the conversation at home will run more to "Dear, don't you just love Festive Fuchsia?" rather than "No. 1094 is so what we want!"</p>
				<p>But Festive Fuchsia won't serve in all situations.  Instead, numerical scales have been developed to measure exactly the electromagnetic data that we more familiarly refer to as colors, and with far greater precision.  Among others, astrophysicists, meteorologists, and engineers all find cause to measure the amount of light absorbed or reflected by a given surface.  The ratio of light that is reflected in comparison to the total energy that strikes such a surface is expressed as its albedo (a term that can be used in relation to all types of electromagnetic energy, and not simply that which is represented by the frequencies that comprise the spectrum of visible light).  Measuring the albedo of a given surface can be useful in connection with everything from consumer product design to calculating the future progress of global warming, not to mention the possibility that remote planets might harbor life.</p>
				<p>Whether vernacular or scientific, and expressed in words or numbers, each methodology assigns a standard set of descriptors to communicate the amount and type of reflected light, and each is equally valid, so long as it serves the purpose of providing useful information.  </p>

					<p>One day, we received drawings in the mail from Brian Watson, our architect, showing a tile design.  We liked the design, but not the colors he had used.  The workman was arriving the next day to set the tile, but Brian hadn't included any color samples with the design from which we could make another selection.  What to do?</p>
				</div>
				<p>What to do, though, if you find yourself caught between these two methodologies, and in need of the precision of the scientific scale while having only words at hand?  This happened to my wife and I while we were remodeling our home a decade ago.  With the interior of our home consigned to a couple of construction dumpsters, we were living and working out of our vacation house on an island off the coast of Maine.  </p>
				<p>One day, we received drawings in the mail from Brian Watson, our architect, showing a tile design inset he was suggesting for the shower in the guest bathroom.  We liked the design, but not the colors he had used in the drawing.  The workman was arriving the next day to set the tile, but Brian hadn't included any color samples with the design from which we could make another selection.  What to do?</p>
				<p>We called Brian and tried to describe the colors we wanted in the abstract.  But lacking a commonly understood color vocabulary (a/k/a, a standard), we were getting nowhere, until Brian had an inspiration.  Like us, he had a six year-old child, which led to a sudden, mid-sentence interjection: "Do you have the complete set of Crayola crayons up there?"  Indeed we did, as did he.  In no time, we had agreed on Burnt Sienna (an original Crayola color, introduced in 1903) and Teal Blue (a shade of more recent vintage, added to the Binney &amp; Smith Big Box in 1990), and our southwestern motif inset was on its way to completion.</p>
				<p>All of which only goes to show that dealing with qualitative data can be a slippery business.  Unless, that is, you've got a standard even if it's only a Big Box of crayons. </p>

				<h4>FEATURED MEETING:</h4>
				<h3 class="red">AN OPEN INVITATION TO ATTEND</h3>
				<h3>GLOBAL  STANDARD  SETTING  2007:  AN  INTERACTIVE  DISCUSSION</h3>
				<p class="center"><strong>Hosted by Gesmer Updegrove LLP</strong><br>40 Broad Street, Third Floor<br>Boston, MA 02109<br>617-350-6800</p>
				<p class="center"><strong>June 20, 2007, 8:30 am</strong> &ndash; <strong>4:00 pm</strong></p>
				<p>On June 20, the third in a series of annual events focused on bringing together leaders of both accredited and non-accredited standards developers will be held, sponsored by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  </p>
				<p>ANSI represents U.S. interests in a number of important global standards organizations, and accredits those traditional standards development organizations (SDOs) that are formed to primarily benefit U.S. interests. Consortia, on the other hand, are not accredited by any national or international authority, and seek to set global standards, and many are headquartered in the United States.  Since SDOs are formed to represent national interests, while consortia are created to serve the interests of an international membership, the paths of these two communities cross constantly in the trenches, but almost never in a formal fashion, except through the many one-on-one liaison relationships established between SDOs and consortia that address the same or adjacent technical areas. </p>
				<p>Despite these differences, SDOs and consortia have far more in common, including the fact that their memberships characteristically overlap heavily.  They also share common concerns relating to intellectual property rights management, governance, member recruitment and retention, and promotion of their work product.  At the same time, each has competencies that the other usually lacks, and experience that its peers of both types could benefit from sharing.  The goal of this year's event will be to not only gain from another exchange of ideas, but also to explore avenues for ongoing communication on a more structured and frequent basis.</p>
				<p>This year's event has been designed to be highly interactive, and will feature brief panel presentations analyzing problems faced by all types of standard setting organizations (SSOs), followed by lengthier, facilitated discussions involving all attendees.  A final discussion period has been set aside to discuss ways in which consortia and accredited organizations can engage more frequently and productively to address matters of common concern.</p>
				<p><strong>Attendance: </strong> Participation is limited to senior management, Board members and other qualified representatives of both accredited and non-accredited SSOs, to ensure a high-level peer-to-peer exchange of issues and ideas.  There is no charge to attend, but space is limited and will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
				<p><strong>Invitations:</strong> If you would like to attend this meeting, please reply to <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">AuConAdd();</script> with your name, title and the name of your organization, or visit the event Web site, at http://www.ansi.org/meetings_events/events/OpenForum07.aspx?menuid=8.</p>
				<p><strong>Location:</strong> 40 Broad Street, Boston (ten minutes from Logan Airport and South Station).  </p>
				<p><strong>Agenda:</strong> The agenda for the event is under continuing development and subject to changes.</p>
