It should be a society &quot;in which human capacity is expanded, built up, nourished and liberated, giving people access to the tools and technologies they need, with the education and training to use them effectively.&quot; The hurdle here, he said, is more political than financial. &quot;The costs of connectivity, computers and mobile telephones can be brought down.

                            <strong>The Observer, November 20, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- There is something about United Nations summits that makes one lose the will to live. All that fly-blown cant about Declarations of Principles and Plans of Action. All those delegates from countries of which one has never previously heard, unable to believe their luck at getting abroad on expenses and determined to make a speech to justify them. All those corporate sleazeballs, circling the delegations like flies round dung-heaps, hoping for Heads of Agreement and laying the groundwork for contracts, not to mention the associated kickbacks generally required to do business in parts of the world where dysentery is an occupational hazard. <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1646575,00.html">...Full Story</a> </p>

No court cases have been filed, but the issue is serious enough that several companies have pledged not to use their patent portfolios against the open source operating system. Some activists have claimed that the whole concept of patent pledges is misguided. ZDNet Australia sister site ZDNet UK spoke with OSDL Chief Executive Stuart Cohen to understand the wider aims of the project. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/soa/Saving_Linux_from_the_lawyers/0,39023769,39223426,00.htm">...Full Story</a> </p>

                            <strong>The Boston Globe, October 30, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- Massachusetts lawmakers are questioning an effort by the Romney administration that could jettison Microsoft's popular Office software from thousands of state computers. At issue is how the state government stores the millions of digital documents and other public records it creates. The Romney administration wants documents stored in a particular format that would allow the records to be read by a variety of software packages -- except Microsoft Office. <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/10/29/senators_question_file_storage_shift/">...Full Story</a> </p>

                            <strong>Computer Business Review Online, November 6, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- The Massachusetts Information Technology Division's decision in early September to adopt OpenDocument 1.0 as the standard for all office documents by January 2007 was seen at the time as a significant victory for open standards, and potentially open source software. But it could end up costing the ITD some of its decision-making power following a last-minute amendment to the Massachusetts Senate Ways and Means Committee's proposed Commonwealth Investment Act. The bill contains the amendment that would create a seven-member information technology expert task force made up of political appointees to approve all state IT policies, standards, and procurement. <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=7A3E0CCD-C482-48E9-A9F9-B573098C926F">...Full Story</a></p>

                            <strong>ComputerActive, November 20, 2005&nbsp;</strong>-- Microsoft has released the first beta version of Office 12, which will introduce the biggest changes to the world's most-used applications for a decade. The 'technical' beta will be available only to certain big customers, but a general release is expected early in 2006....However Microsoft has so far said filters to allow legacy software to use the new formats will be available only for more recent versions. It seems that this does not include Word 97, for instance. This could cause confusion in organisations with thousands of computers, some of them IT antiques. A more long-term, and fundamental, question about the new formats is whether they can or should qualify as a standard for cross-platform information exchange. There are calls, including one from the EC, for international agreement on standard formats that are not controlled by one company. <a href="http://www.computeractive.co.uk/personal-computer-world/news/2146251/first-beta-office-released">...Full Story</a> </p>

                            <strong>BusinessWeek.com October 30, 2005</strong> --&nbsp;It's a matter of public record that at least three companies participated in a global conspiracy to manipulate the prices of computer memory chips. The U.S. Justice Dept. settled the issue by handing down more than $600 million in fines against the businesses. What isn't known, though, is why they did it. And Rambus, a designer of chip technology, is intent on finding out. Rambus on Oct. 31 will urge a California Superior Court in San Francisco to release documents it says will help in that pursuit. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2005/tc20051031_874429.htm">...Full Story</a> </p>

                            <strong>Bloomberg.com, November 8, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- A judge in Virginia threw out Samsung Electronics Co.'s lawsuit over four patents against the computer chip designer Rambus Inc., allowing Rambus to focus its legal strategy on cases in California. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Payne in Richmond, Virginia, today granted Rambus's request to dismiss the suit after Rambus said it no longer planned to seek royalties from Samsung for the patents. Rambus's action removes the litigation from Payne's court, where the company in March lost a key ruling over the same patents against Infineon Technologies AG. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&sid=atZAYli5khig&refer=asia">...Full Story</a> </p>

                            <strong>By: Chris Mellor</strong><br>
                            <strong>Techworld, November 15, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- Infineon is getting out of the DRAM business. According to a EE Times report using Reuters information Infineon will sell its DRAM facilities to Micron and Nanya Technology. Micron would buy the US facility and Nanya the non-US ones. In August this year it was reported that Infineon was to supply DRAM components to Microsoft for its XBox games console. Assurances must have been given to Microsoft about continuity of supply and Micron is probably the inheritor of that contract. <a href="http://www.techworld.com/storage/news/index.cfm?newsid=4791&inkc=0">...Full Story</a> </p>

                            <strong>InfoWorld.com November 3, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- The U.S. Supreme Court has decided not to hear a Microsoft Corp. appeal in the software company's ongoing Web browsing patent dispute with the University of California and Eolas Technologies Inc. Microsoft had already been dealt a $520.6 million judgement in the case two years ago, but appealed it on several fronts. With Monday's decision, the Supreme Court has decided not to hear Microsoft's argument relating to how damages in the case should be calculated. <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/31/HNmseolas_1.html">...Full Story</a> </p>

After having recruited all the vendors they could, and then all of the content owners they could -- and still without becoming the clear winner, Toshiba has gone to the limit, by offering to license its HD-DVD technology to low-cost manufacturers in China. How rational is that? Well, the whole idea of winning the format wars instead of reaching a compromise with the Blu-Ray Group years ago was to reap the big royalties on controlling the winning standard -- and therefore earning high royalties on every player sold. Now its sacrificing much of that advantage before sales even begin, sacrificing much of the high-margin early years of production to low margin competition right out to the gate.

                        </a></strong><strong>The Financial Express, November 6, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- In the high-stakes battle with Sony over whose format will power the next generation of DVD players, Toshiba has adopted a potentially perilous strategy: encouraging low-cost Chinese competitors to crank out machines using its standard, known as HD-DVD. Courting Chinese makers has been largely taboo in Japan, where manufacturers like Sony and Panasonic have long tried to delay the transition of their technologies into cheap commodities. Toshiba&rsquo;s decision could have major ramifications in the race for the billions of dollars likely to flow from the next generation of DVD technology, which promises enhanced pictures and audio and more disc space. <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=107655">...Full Story</a> </p>
