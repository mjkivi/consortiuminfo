                  </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This issue is the third in a series  exploring the evolving relationship between the private and public sectors, as  they confront the increasingly intractable challenges of a modern world.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This series began in August, with an  examination of the poor coordination that too often characterizes the standard  setting partnership between the government and private-sector in the United  States.&nbsp; That issue included a call to  optimize that relationship to national advantage.&nbsp; The September issue focused on a current drama unfolding in the  Massachusetts state government, involving both open standards and open source  software.&nbsp; The current experience of the  Commonwealth highlights the importance of these tools in the modern world, as  well as the significant role that governments can play in accelerating their  adoption by society at large.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In this issue, I look to the future, and  ask whether we will be able to meet new challenges (such as global warming)  that are of a type and magnitude that our existing political systems seem  inadequate to address, and which will require a variety of standards solutions. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This examination begins in the <em><strong>Editorial</strong></em>, which contrasts  the current need for universal cooperation to solve global issues with the slow  progress achieved to date towards that goal, and asks whether the consensus  based standard setting process might provide a better model for the future than  historical treaty negotiations.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This month&rsquo;s <em><strong>Feature Article</strong></em> looks far into the  future, suggesting what a long-term approach to solving global environmental  issues might resemble, as we become better able to monitor the effects of  regulations, and to utilize the resulting data to refine such restrictions  directed at environmental preservation and enabling sustainable  development.&nbsp; The result would be the  need for dynamic rather than static standards, capable of adjusting to new  information as it becomes available.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The <em><strong>Trends</strong></em> piece this month  looks back to the September issue, and provides a timeline of the ongoing  developments in the OpenDocument saga.&nbsp;  As these events demonstrate, some of the largest technology companies in  the world are continuing to press their standards-based advantage in an effort  to break Microsoft&rsquo;s dominance in office productivity software, providing a  unique opportunity to observe how a single standard can profoundly affect the  marketplace.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">My <em><strong>Standards Blog</strong></em> selection for  this month looks in on the status of a different global governance story  relating to standards: the World Summit on the Information Society that will  conclude its originally contemplated work at a meeting in Tunis in  November.&nbsp; Going into that meeting, the  United States stands alone regarding the control of the root directory of the  Internet, and in this post, you can learn how you can log on and tell the U.S.  Ambassador to the process who you think should &quot;govern the Internet.&quot;</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">And finally, this month's <em><strong>Consider This</strong></em> tries to answer  the question of &quot;why standards matter&quot; in the greater context of the  societal concerns that have been the subject of this series of issues. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Next month, we will conclude this series on the intersection of  standards, government and society with an in-depth of review of what happens at  Tunis in the final WSIS meetings, and what the decisions made there may portend  for the future.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As always, I hope you enjoy  this issue.&nbsp;</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">One of the most transformative  images of the 1960's was the first publicly released, color picture of the  earth as seen from lunar orbit.&nbsp; Like a  small, blue-green marble lost in the immense black void of space, this view of  earth became a metaphor in 1969 for many of the fragility of our planet, and a  timely totem for the then-emerging environmental movement.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The years that immediately  followed saw many victories for environmentalists in the United States,  including passage of the Environmental Protection Act in 1969 (which  established the Environmental Protection Agency), the extension and then  amendment of the Clean Air Act (1970 and 1977), and the enactment of the Clean  Water Act (1972), Safe Drinking Water Act (1975) and Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act, which established the so-called &quot;Super Fund&quot;  (1976).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The result of these and other  pieces of legislation was cleaner air and water, the remediation of many  notorious hazardous waste sites, the conservation of millions of acres of  federal and state lands, and increasing awareness of the negative impact that  human activities continue to have on our environment.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But the early momentum of the environmental  movement of the 1960s and 1970s has not been sustained uniformly throughout the  world, where Europe (for example), largely assigns a higher priority to  environmental concerns than does the United States, both absolutely as well as  philosophically.&nbsp; For example, in the  U.S., &quot;hard science&quot; is often demanded to prove that a given action  or substance will have a deleterious effect, while in Europe, the possibility  of such an effect may be sufficient to result in legislative action.&nbsp; These same divisions are present within the  United States itself, resulting in swings of policy when control of government  passes from one party to the other.&nbsp; The  most significant example of such a swing was the repudiation of the Kyoto  Protocol on global warming by the current administration, following signature  -- but not submission to Congress for ratification -- of the Protocol by the  Clinton administration, which was aware of significant opposition to the  Protocol in the Senate.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Historically, such variations in  policy might be of concern solely to the citizens of the nation involved.&nbsp; But increasingly, the actions of one nation  can impact the welfare of many, not only with respect to over-exploiting a  single common resource, but by degrading the very biosphere we all share as  well. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The extremely complex example of  global warming therefore marks a transition from an era during which the  &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; was the primary international environmental  concern (i.e., when everyone shares in the ownership of a resource - such as  fish stocks -- there is a greater incentive for any single user to exploit it  than to conserve it).&nbsp; And yet efforts  to address even single-resource issues via international treaties have proven  to be difficult enough. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Nor is global warming the only  emerging area of common concern.&nbsp;  Currently, an initiative commissioned by the United Nations, known as  the World Summit for the Information Society, or WSIS, is concluding a two-year  process that includes examination of the question &quot;Who should govern the  Internet?&quot;&nbsp; Following the most  recent meeting in that process in Geneva in August, the near unanimous opinion  appears to be &quot;not the United States,&quot; at least as regards the root  directory of the Internet, which is currently under the indirect control of the  U.S. Department of Commerce.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">From one perspective, the Internet  and the Web are simply a new virtual element of our environment, and in that  sense present parallel concerns to environmental issues.&nbsp; True, telecommunications treaties and commonly  agreed upon standards have always existed.&nbsp;  But their impact was largely internal to the countries involved -- if  you chose not to sign such treaties or adopt such standards, you lost the  benefits of the network, but did not harm the interests of others (other than  by taking your nation out of the network, either fully or partially).&nbsp; But he who controls the root directory of  the Internet can, literally, disconnect an entire nation.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">As time goes on, issues that  require international cooperation are bound to multiply rather than diminish,  and today we have no comprehensive, binding (or even consensual and  demonstrably successful) process for dealing with them.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">So what are we to do?&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Sadly, there are four, seemingly  intractable problems to be solved.&nbsp;  Using global warming as an example, the first is identifying and  quantifying the problem to be addressed (is the atmosphere warming, and are we  indeed the cause?).&nbsp; The second is  agreeing on the priority to be assigned to the problem at hand (which element  should be given greater weight: the impact to the economy, or the impact to the  environment?).&nbsp; The third is the means  of addressing the risk (should emission controls fall equally on all nations,  or should third world countries be granted allowances to compensate for the  damage already done by those nations that have already achieved a modern stage  of development?)</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">And lastly, there is the hardest  question: will nations be willing to yield a measure of their historical  sovereignty in order to achieve effective solutions to global problems?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">To date, the answer to that  question has been &quot;no,&quot; which has made reaching a decision on the  first three questions that much more difficult.&nbsp; Some 86 years after the founding of the League of Nations, there  is still no global body that is empowered to create a law that is binding upon  all.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">If we assume that the answer to  the sovereignty issue will continue to be &quot;no&quot; for some time, then we  have no choice but to find a different way to solve problems such as global  warming, because we cannot wait to find a solution.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Perhaps a model for that solution  may be found in the standard setting process.&nbsp;  After all, what other system exists that is not only global, consensual  and successful, but involves the voluntary giving up of rights in order to  achieve a common good?&nbsp; This process, in  fact, has found a solution to the conundrum of the Tragedy of the Commons by  identifying benefits in the exploitation of opportunities that can only be  achieved by reaching consensus.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The magic of the standard setting  process is that it makes the risk of standing outside the process greater than  the costs and concessions required to participate.&nbsp; In consequence, not only do those whose participation is vital to  success willingly engage in the process, but they adopt the resulting standards  without the compulsion of laws as well. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">To an extent, this is how the  treaty process has historically operated as well, but characteristically  sanctions for non-compliance have been required in order to achieve success,  because compliance may be seen to be more costly and disadvantageous than  non-compliance.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The lesson of the standard setting  process, then, is that it takes carrots as well as sticks to bring stakeholders  -- multinational corporations as well as nations -- not only to the table, but  to compliance as well, until that day when even more urgent changes force a  different answer to the sovereignty question.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Perhaps the WSIS process will  provide the crucible within which a first step in this direction may be taken,  as the standard setting process and nationalism meet in the same room, in an  effort to solve a common problem.</p>

              <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style2">Introduction: </span></em></strong><span class="style2"> Humanity today is facing the reality that resources are finite, as is the capacity of the world to absorb the punishment that we are inflicting upon the environment.  Having passed the point where the earth's resiliency was equal to our impact, we must now achieve an understanding of the workings of the environment that is sufficient to bring our effects back within the bounds of that resilience.  Doing so will be a matter of unparalleled complexity, and will require an endless process of data gathering, integration, modeling, regulation, and then monitoring to determine whether the desired effects have been achieved.</span>
                    <p><span class="style2">Each of these steps may require  the development of new standards, but the types of standards that will be  needed may not be the same as those that have been sufficient to address  previous challenges.&nbsp; Nor, perhaps, will  traditional standard setting organizations be appropriate to develop them. </span>
                    <p class="style2">Standards have historically  addressed discrete tasks: from defining weights and measures in millennia past  to baud rates and interfaces today.&nbsp;  Because the problems these standards were created to solve were finite,  they could be (and were) useful in isolation, often needing no coherent  connection to any other standards at all, even in the case of weights and  measures, as in the chaotic, ad hoc English system that evolved over time.&nbsp; Even where such relationships were coherent,  as in the Metric system, the base ten relationships between the various weights  and measures were provided for convenience rather than out of actual  necessity.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">The creation of standards, not  surprisingly, has therefore been accomplished in discrete settings, either by  governments from the days of Hammurabi to the present, in the case of weights  and measures, or inside individual standard setting organizations in modern  times, sometimes formed to create a single specification, or at most to develop  standards for a well-delimited technical or business domain.</p>
              <p class="style2">Today, this insular, distributed  system is already being challenged by many forces, most obviously by the  convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) within the same  network, and even the same device.&nbsp; No  longer can a single standard exist in a business and technical vacuum.&nbsp; Instead, it may be invoked by a mobile  device that may not only provide for voice communication, but also may include  camera, video, Web browsing, PDA, music and other functions as well.&nbsp; The demands for versatility on a standard  may also transcend technical compatibility issues, to involve economic and  business concerns as well.&nbsp; For example,  a standard originally designed for use in a royalty-tolerant commercial setting  may now be needed in another where royalties are not tolerable, and open source  licensing terms are mandated. </p>
              <p class="style2">Standards thus increasingly have  meaning within larger and more complex contexts, forcing those that create a  standard to accommodate new demands, and to re-balance the concerns that would  have been considered in defining the same type of standard only a short time  ago with ones that have only recently emerged.&nbsp;  Since convergence and innovation will continue, care will also be  demanded to anticipate the future use to which a standard may be put. </p>
              <p class="style2">Still, even in this broader  context, a given standard typically remains only a part of a single module  within a larger system.&nbsp; For example,  the U.S. Department of Defense desires to create a global ITC infrastructure  that will support the &quot;network centric operations&quot; of the combined  armed forces of the U.S. and its allies wherever located, anywhere in the  world.&nbsp; In this model, the data from a  single source (e.g., a battlefield sensor) would become not only accessible,  but would also identify itself, to those users out of more than a million  individuals with network access that have the credentials to receive that  particular type -- and source -- of data.</p>
              <p class="style2">Such a vision, while imposing,  still represents the pursuit of traditional ICT standards goals writ very  large, since each of the standards required to meet this grand design needs  only to interact with other standards in time-honored ways.&nbsp; Thus, while the vision may be grand and the  task of creating such standards will become more complex, the nature of the  demands placed upon an individual specification will remain familiar.<br>
                        <br>
                The traditional standards  infrastructure, then, has proven itself capable of scaling very  impressively.&nbsp; Doubtless it will  continue to do so, but only to meet the increasing complexity of traditional  challenges.</p>
              <p class="style2">Today, however, significant  environmental challenges are emerging that involve multiple, changing  variables, and for which traditional static standards will prove  inadequate.&nbsp; To meet this type of need,  webs of standards that are dynamic rather than fixed will be required, with  each individual standard interconnecting with and adjusting as required by  changes in independent variables.&nbsp; Some  of these standards, rather than serving the network, would in a sense become  the network itself.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Agreeing upon and utilizing such  standards will demand a new type of infrastructure as well, requiring new types  of international relationships in order to marshal the means and the will to  tackle issues that may only be solved through determined, collaborative action.  These standards may appropriately be referred to as &quot;standards for a small  planet.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>The need for a new type of standard:</em>&nbsp;</span> The definition of a standard has never been  static.&nbsp; From weights and measures, to  standards that achieve physical interoperability (e.g., train gauges and screw  threads), then safety (e.g., pressure standards for boilers), performance  (e.g., tensile strengths for airframe materials), and finally virtual  interoperability (e.g., radio frequencies and software interfaces), the concept  of the commonly agreed upon tools we call standards has continued to expand and  evolve.</p>
              <p class="style2">Most of these tools, however,  could and often have incorporated somewhat arbitrarily determined  characteristics, since what was needed was any, rather than a specific standard  for a weight, or for the distance between railroad rails, or even for a radio  frequency, so long as the exact parameters chosen lay within certain bounds of  practicality.&nbsp; And most importantly,  once fixed, the utility of a standard has historically been based upon the  assumption that it would never change.</p>
              <p class="style2">But static standards are only useful  in unchanging circumstances.&nbsp; Indeed, a  standard relies on the assumption that the physical world and the natural laws  that govern it will not change.&nbsp; But can  such a standard be useful when the goal is in fact to change, or limit the  change, of the physical world as part of a continuing process, or must such a  standard also adjust, adapting as the desired results are achieved (or not)?</p>
              <p class="style2">Over the last several decades  there has been a growing appreciation that the world's resources, as well as  the earth's capacity to absorb abuse, are both finite.&nbsp; From this realization have come many new and  difficult questions that raise social, geopolitical and equitable  questions.&nbsp; If resources are finite, how  should they be allocated, and who should be entitled to make such a  judgment?&nbsp; If given actions can damage  common, global resources, or result in deleterious effects such as global  warming, how can this damage be prevented or moderated, and does one nation  have a right to influence the actions of another?&nbsp; If not, how will such restrictions be agreed upon and enforced?</p>
              <p class="style2">As yet, there are no wholly  satisfactory answers to such questions when the actions required extend beyond  national boundaries, although the need for such answers grows more urgent by  the day.&nbsp; But if international consensus  on these questions could be achieved, how will we decide what specific actions  need to be taken, and how will we know whether they are working?&nbsp; And as among a variety of actions that could  be taken, would we&nbsp; be able to determine  which would be the most economical and present the most acceptable burden upon  society?</p>
              <p class="style2">Solving these problems will  involve ever more sophisticated modeling that will utilize available data to  project what actions will have what results (both positive and negative) on a  factor by factor basis (e.g., will carbon dioxide rise or fall if we do X?),  and, in turn, what those reactions will have on other factors (if carbon  dioxide levels can be made to fall on average by .003% between latitudes 75 and  80 north between May and June of each year, what else changes?)&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Because such downstream effects  can only be estimated, there will be a need for intensive data collection in  order to measure the effects of environmental protection actions taken in order  to learn, in part by trial and error, what effects human actions and policies  are having.&nbsp; As importantly, there will  also need to be formulae &ndash; variable standards &ndash; that utilize these data in a  feedback loop in order to indefinitely adjust regulations and policies on a  constant, periodic basis.&nbsp; These  standards will need to balance not only scientific data, but political and  economic feasibility as well, in order to determine the most expedient and  achievable means to the required ends.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">In other words, unlike traditional  standards that answer only to fixed, direct physical and cost issues, new  environmental and sustainable resource standards will need to be developed via  a process that incorporates not only scientific data, but accommodates forces  as non-empirical as arguments for social equity between developing and  developed nations &ndash; as has already been witnessed in the rancorous debate over  the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>The current state of the art:</em></strong>&nbsp; Designing such standards will involve  acquiring skills that we currently largely lack.&nbsp; While science continues to provide grater understanding of  natural processes, actual attempts to achieve sustainability have been limited  to discrete resources, such as in the management of commercial fishing stocks and  populations of game animals.&nbsp; In the  case of game, there has been reasonable success.&nbsp; But game animals can be counted in the field and at harvest, and  the legal take can be limited on an annual basis through managing the length of  seasons and the number of licenses issued.&nbsp;  Fishing stocks are harder to estimate and can be more difficult to  monitor, and the ecological webs involved within which they exist are complex  and hidden as well.&nbsp; As a result,  success to date in this area has been limited at best, and many of the forces  resulting in recoveries and declines remain largely a black box.</p>
              <p class="style2">The concept of sustainability  seems to have found its greatest purchase in the area of &ldquo;sustainable  development,&rdquo; which conjoins recognition of current human needs with  environmental concerns and seeks to reconcile the two in a fashion that does  justice to the needs of our descendants.&nbsp;  The concept has received the formal support of the United Nations (which  published the report of the Brundtland Commission in 1987 on this topic), as  well as recognition by several nations (for example, France acknowledged  environmental responsibility in an amendment to its constitution in 2004, as  did Poland in Article 5 of its 1997 constitution).</p>
              <p class="style2">Other activity has been taken by  private industry, non-governmental organizations and other non-profits.&nbsp; Examples of these efforts include  initiatives in areas such as ethical investing and enabling environmentally  responsible purchasing (e.g., certifying that lumber products have been harvested  in a sustainable, environmentally-friendly fashion).&nbsp; But since compliance with such standards is elective, their  impact has to date been limited, relegating the role of such efforts to one of  leadership rather than meaningful and systemic change.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>The role of government:</em></strong>&nbsp; It would seem obvious, then, that global  environmental and resource problems can only be solved through international  governmental action.&nbsp; The leading effort  to date in this area, of course, has been the multi-year effort to agree upon  curtailment of global warming via the negotiation and execution of the Kyoto  Protocol, which the United States has thus far declined to ratify.&nbsp; Despite this setback, the fact that  widespread agreement was achieved at all represents a hope for the future.&nbsp; And while the Federal government of the  United States has not committed the nation as a whole to comply with the Kyoto  Protocol, individual states (such as California and Massachusetts) have moved  forcefully to set environmental laws that are more strict than their Federal  analogs.</p>
              <p class="style2">Given the near-unanimous  ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and the growing scientific consensus that  human actions are contributing to a process of global warming, it seems likely  that efforts to curtail green house gases will increase.&nbsp; With the commitment of governments comes the  possibility of affecting real change, but the question then arises of what  specific changes should be required.&nbsp; In  the short term, the obvious answer is to seek any reductions in the most pernicious  gases and substances that are politically achievable, since at this juncture in  history only a reduction, rather than the elimination, of the impact is  feasible.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">But in the long term &ndash; ten, twenty  or fifty years from today &ndash; there will need to be better and more calibrated  goals that permit the maximum environmental protection to be achieved at the  minimum economic cost.&nbsp; With more  precise measurements and understanding of industrial causes and environmental  effects, better calculations of the true avoided cost savings of various types  of actions, such as development of new alternative energy infrastructures, will  also become possible.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">The concept of such an evolution  in strategies for attacking environmental and resource challenges would be roughly  analogous to the evolution of cancer therapy in modern times.&nbsp; Following decades when surgery and radiation  were the only treatment options, the first efficacious chemical agents were  discovered.&nbsp; However, the pathology of  cancer at the cellular level was poorly understood, leading to the shotgun  application of a limited number of harsh chemotherapy regimes to all patients  that were diagnosed with a single type of cancer, identified only grossly by  the organ of origin (e.g., liver or pancreas).&nbsp;  More recently, it has become clear that in fact there are many different  variations within what were previously thought to be single types of cancer,  and that many of these varieties have unique points of vulnerability.&nbsp; With the discovery of new drugs based upon  new treatment theories derived to exploit these points of opportunity, doctors  are beginning to utilize more highly-targeted and efficacious therapies that  match a given drug regime with the specific sub-type of cancer involved.</p>
              <p class="style2">Working towards such a goal in the  case of resource utilization and environmental protection is neither  unreasonable nor impossible.&nbsp; Already a  variety of different greenhouse gasses have been identified, and more is  learned all the time which ones are most potent, and in what ways the various  components of the atmosphere react with each other to reach specific end  results.&nbsp; As more is learned, more  &quot;treatment options&quot; will therefore become possible, as well as the  prioritization of the benefits and costs of controlling specific agents.</p>
              <p class="style2">When one takes the long view  (e.g., the world that our great-grandchildren will inhabit), there is little  choice but to raise the level of restrictions on our activities until  equilibrium is reached, and ideally to work towards recovering lost ground.&nbsp; But maintaining equilibrium in a system as  complex as the earth's biosphere will be a challenge indeed.&nbsp; Even here, however, there are analogies to  be found, such as today's efforts to control national economies through the  actions (in the case of the United States) of the Federal Reserve, which  closely monitors and seeks to influence the vastly complex fluctuations of the  marketplace through a constant process of interest rate adjustments.</p>
              <p class="style2">As with the economy, there will  need to be regulations and standards applied that are not fixed, but  variable.&nbsp; A standard that is applied in  one year may not be appropriate for even the next, as other variables change,  or as the monitoring of causes and effects permits the refinement of the  standards and regulations being applied.</p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>What is to be done:</em>&nbsp;</span> If the concept of empirical and dynamic  global sustainability standards is to be pursued on a systemic basis, it would  require an effort of a magnitude and type not previously attempted, and would  involve tasks such as the following:</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Data identification</em>:&nbsp;</strong> Data of may types will be required in order  to support a growing global population on a sustaining basis.&nbsp; The following provide a representative  sample of the questions that must be answered through the gathering of such  data:</p>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Global warming:</em></strong>&nbsp; What are the existing percentages of the  various substances that contribute to global warming (gas, particulate, etc.)?  What is the magnitude of the effect of each, both alone and in combination with  other agents? How fast are production levels of these agents changing, and who  is producing them?</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Non-renewable resources:</em>&nbsp;</strong> What are the technically and economically  available stocks of hundreds of non-renewable resources, both energy-producing  as well as raw materials for production?&nbsp;&nbsp;  What percentage of each of these resources is recoverable without  unacceptable degradation of the environment?&nbsp;  What will our future needs be, and can alternatives be found as  resources become exhausted?</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Renewable resources:</em></strong>&nbsp; To what extent can we continue to harvest  non-domestic flora and fauna without imperiling their survival?&nbsp; How do human activities impact the  environments upon which such species depend?&nbsp;  How can forests be harvested in a manner that is both sustainable and  environmentally acceptable?&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Impacts:</em></strong>&nbsp;  What are the environmental impacts and remediation costs of the  thousands of processes upon which modern society depends, from mineral  extraction to processing to final disposal?</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Food resources:</em></strong>&nbsp; What is the carrying capacity of arable  land?&nbsp; What land can be utilized within  the limits of locally available water resources?&nbsp; What will be the impact of altering existing vegetation on the  carbon dioxide cycle?&nbsp; What will be the  transportation costs and energy demands of distributing this food, and what  practical limits will such costs impose on where people can live?&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Data acquisition and integration:</em></strong>&nbsp; Once identified by type and purpose, the  data would need to be acquired, presumably through international cooperation  and/or via new global institutions, and then integrated in a way that permits  the use of that data for multiple purposes.&nbsp;  New GIS and other standards would play a key role in this process.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Theorizing and technical modeling:</em></strong>&nbsp; When collected, the data would be utilized  to generate models that would test the effects of modifying individual  variables against all outcomes of concern (both positive and negative, on a  systemic basis).</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Economic and geopolitical  evaluation:</em>&nbsp;</strong> While the technical feasibility of modifying certain industrial outputs  would be the first step, the economic impact and geopolitical feasibility of  actually mandating such behavior would be equally vital, as would reliable,  long-term public funding, immune from the impacts of changes of  administrations.</p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>Achieving consensus:</em>&nbsp;</span> Once the best alternatives were identified,  they would need to be &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to the global community.&nbsp; This would involve not just buy-in to absolute goals, but  resolution of the type of issues that complicated the Kyoto process as well,  such as whether restrictions should apply equally to all nations (the U.S.  position), or should impact less developed countries less severely than nations  those that have already modernized (the Protocol&rsquo;s approach).</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Monitoring and Enforcement:</em>&nbsp;</strong> Public agreement may be more easily achieved  in the future than actual compliance.&nbsp;  Mechanisms would therefore be needed to monitor human behavior as well  as the environment.&nbsp; Contemporary experience  under existing treaties, such as the WTO and those intended to avoid nuclear  arms proliferation, indicates that this will be an ongoing challenge.&nbsp; On a positive note, such existing mechanisms  can provide a precedent for future action.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Data updating and integration:</em></strong> Monitoring the  success or failure of regulatory restrictions at achieving desired results will  be essential, because evidence of positive effects will only become clear very  slowly.&nbsp; Thus, if limits are set too low  or permitted resource utilization levels are too high, many years of damage may  become inevitable before readjustment can be agreed upon and remedial actions  take effect.&nbsp; Similarly, if controls are  set strictly, the ability to prove positive results as quickly as possible  (however minor) will be vital in order to maintain the global will to accept  such restrictions.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Standards readjustment:</em>&nbsp;</strong> Over time, the system will need to be  adjusted on a periodic, ongoing basis, as normal variables take effect (e.g.,  natural weather cycles), as global development occurs in unexpected ways (e.g.,  regional population spikes and dips), as catastrophic events (e.g., volcanic  eruptions) have temporary impacts, as new industrial processes are devised  which have new environmental effects, as data collection efforts become more  sophisticated, and as the interrelationship between variables becomes better  understood.</p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>System requirements:</em>&nbsp;</span> What would be required to enable such an  effort?&nbsp; At minimum, the following:</p>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Critical Mass:</em></strong>&nbsp; Participation by a sufficient number of  nations, measured by aggregate impact, would be essential in order to ensure  that the effort could be successful rather than merely symbolic.&nbsp; This participation would involve not only  the willingness to accept restrictions, but cooperation in data collection as  well.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Methodology:</em>&nbsp;</strong> Agreement would be needed on whether  globally mandated restrictions or nationally determined strategies would be  utilized.&nbsp; The answer might vary on a  problem-by-problem basis.&nbsp; For example,  a cod is a cod, but various gases contribute to a single problem, and one  nation may find one more economically palatable to curtail than another.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Authority:</em>&nbsp;</strong> The participants would need to agree to  permit international inspection and monitoring of compliance, as well as agree  to submit to sanctions for a failure to comply.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Structure (political):</em>&nbsp;</strong> Either a United Nations agency, a new treaty  organization, or a body of a wholly new design would be required to provide the  venue within which agreement could be reached and through which compliance  would be enforced.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><strong><em>Structure (science):</em>&nbsp;</strong> A global organization, or alliance, would be  needed to collect, integrate and update data, as well as to perform modeling  and ratify recommendations for political adoption, as well as to fine-tune the  standards derived and approved over time.&nbsp;  Ideally, a single organization (rather than each nation individually)  would perform this function and release the data upon which restrictions would  be based, to lessen the likelihood of disputes.&nbsp; Such an organization would need to be apolitical and immune from  external influence to the greatest extent possible.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                      <li class="style2"><span class="style83"><em>Structure (standards):</em>&nbsp;</span> At every step of the way, there would be the  need to identify and use existing standards, as well to create traditional and  dynamic standards for data measurement, analysis, limitations, and monitoring.&nbsp; Creating and integrating these standards  will likely require not only the creation of new standard setting  organizations, but also a level and type of cooperation between existing  standards organizations and governments that has not been required to address  historical problems.&nbsp; </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Conclusions:</em></strong>&nbsp; Is such a process so Herculean as to be  unimaginable?&nbsp; The first reaction would  be to say yes.&nbsp; But the more sobering  reflection is whether we have any choice but to undertake it.&nbsp; Even if global populations were to stabilize  in the future, it is hardly probable that stasis could be achieved at a number  that is not billions higher than at present.&nbsp;  Certainly there can be no doubt that, absent significant changes in our behavior,  our existing resources and the resilience of our environment would be  insufficient to withstand the onslaught of nine billion people, each hoping to  enjoy the life style of a typical American.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">On a more hopeful note (depending  upon one's point of view), the challenge we face is not monolithic, but rather  a host of nested imbalances that need to be redressed.&nbsp; While global warming has garnered the lion&rsquo;s  share of recent headlines, there are countless smaller issues within the  over-all fractal pattern of environmental degradation and resource depletion,  from the die-off of coral reefs to the destruction of rain forests.&nbsp; Although each of these issues represents its  own set of challenges that must be understood and resolved, each also  represents its own test bed from which much generic expertise will grow and  transferable discoveries will be made in a new discipline that may come to be  known as &ldquo;sustainability science.&rdquo;</p>
              <p class="style2">As such experience does grow,  scientific tools and standards will be devised to make use of this  experience.&nbsp; Hopefully the necessary  political will and international structures will evolve as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps as the simpler challenges are  successfully addressed, public determination will grow, and the mores of  society will permanently settle into a state where maintaining sustainable  balances will become an unquestionable mandate.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">And if not?&nbsp; That is not a question with an answer that  is pleasant to contemplate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Truly, the  credo of NASA is one that might usefully be appropriated for this effort:&nbsp; Failure is not an option.</p>

              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p><span class="style2">If commerce can be theater, than certainly the current full-frontal assault on Microsoft Office by a significant number of the largest technology companies in the world is such, and political theater at that.  And while the OpenDocument office suite and then the format of the same name developed by OASIS have been under development for years, it was the announcement by Massachusetts that its Executive Agencies, for pragmatic reasons, would be required to use products supporting the OpenDocument OASIS Format that unleashed the corporate hounds in full cry in the hunt to tree Microsoft at last. </span>
                    <p><span class="style2"> Since the last issue of the Consortium Standards Bulletin <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php"> OpenDocument and Massachusetts:  the Commonwealth Leads the Way</a></a> scarcely a day has passed without some announcement, large or small, calculated to maintain the maximum momentum possible in the drive to break Microsoft's dominance in office productivity software, an immensely profitable line of business (at least for a vendor that can maintain an 85% market share). </span>
                    <p><span class="style2"> The stakes, of course, are much greater than just stealing market share in a single product space.  If Microsoft's competitors can succeed with OpenDocument, then Microsoft will not only be weakened in this product space, but both open source software and open standards will gain credibility and appeal in the marketplace as well. </span>
                    <p><span class="style2"> This brief space in time thus presents a unique opportunity to observe a variety of fascinating dramas unfold concurrently in rapid, real time, from the combined efforts of companies like Sun and IBM to press their advantage, to Corel's Quixotic effort to accomplish whatever Corel is trying to accomplish (itself an open question as of this writing), to Microsoft's public positioning regarding OpenDocument at the same time that may assume it to be pushing for a counterattack in the Massachusetts legislature. </span>
                    <p><span class="style2"> And all of this has been made possible by the creation of a humble (if ambitious and complex) standard.  If the current efforts to unhorse Microsoft in the office productivity software marketplace are even partially successful, let it not be forgotten what was the nature of the engine of destruction that eventually accomplished a decades-long quest. </span>
                    <p><span class="style2"> With that as prelude, here is a day-by-day chronology of the more significant developments in the last 30 days in the continuing OpenDocument saga.  As this issue goes to virtual press, the crescendo continues to build. </span>

Not surprisingly, this process has raised the question of "who should control the Internet?"

              <p class="style2">Amazingly enough, on November 2, you'll have the opportunity on-line to tell the U.S. representative in this process who you think should hold the keys.  I'll tell you how later in this post. </p>
              <p class="style2">But first, a little background.  Who controls the Internet today? </p>
              <p class="style2">Right now, the answer is, "it depends on what aspect you're talking about."  If you're talking about the standards that enable the Internet, the answer is a number of non-profit, global consortia (e.g., the W3C and the IETF).  But if you're talking about the root directory of the Internet &ndash; the country codes (in one database) and the individual addresses given to individual computers (in another) -- then you're talking about the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, popularly referred to as <a href="http://www.icann.org/"> ICANN</a>. </p>
              <p class="style2">ICANN is, on the one hand, a non-profit that is headquartered in the U.S. and has an international Board.   But on the other hand, it is subject to the will of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which in turn is a unit of the U.S. Department of Commerce.  And there's the rub, because theoretically, someone in Washington could call someone in California at ICANN some day and tell him to turn off, oh, say, Iran or North Korea (not that they would, of course). </p>
              <p class="style2">So when the WSIS process began, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which might have, but didn't, bid for control of the Internet during it's chaotic early days, put the "control of the Internet" on the table (the ITU is an agency of the UN, and is also primarily responsible for organizing and running the WSIS process).  As a result, the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) came into being, and discussion quickly zeroed in on control of the root directory as a matter of international concern. </p>
              <p class="style2">All that's happened in the past two years would fill a book (and doubtless some day will), but if you want to get quickly up to speed, here's how to go about it.  Start with this article from July of 2004, called <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/july04.php#feature">Who Should Govern the Internet?</a> Then go to the ConsortiumInfo.org News Portal <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=25">WSIS/Internet Governance</a> subcategory, and you'll find c. 25 articles and blog entries from the past five months tracking what's been happening leading up to the final WSIS meeting in Tunis, including the recent PrepCon3 meeting in Geneva when even the European Union deserted the U.S.  A particularly good article by Kevin Murphy linked there describes how the current system works. </p>
              <p class="style2">In truth, this is a big and important issue, because although today it's America' condescending attitude regarding ICANN that is under the microscope, in the future, it will be other issues, including, perhaps, the future technical development of the Internet or the Web, whether content could be censored, and so on.  So what happens in Tunis matters to everyone, in the first world as well as the developing world, because it represents the beginning, and not the end, of the discussion on such issues. </p>
              <p class="style2">So with that as prelude, here's how you can let the U.S. government know who you thinks should "govern the Internet" in the future. </p>
              <p class="style2">The lead representative for the U.S. is <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/46292.htm">Ambassador David A. Gross</a>, a Bush appointee who has served since August 2001 as the U.S. Coordinator for International Communications and Information Policy in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs.  If you go to an October 28 posting at the USINFO.STATE.GOV site called <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2005&m=October&x=20051028142855cmretrop0.290539&t=livefeeds/wf-latest.html">Expanding Internet Access Must Remain World Focus at Summit</a> you'll see the current U.S., position.  And at the very end of the post, you'll find this: </p>
              <blockquote>
                                  <p class="style2">In a November 2 Internet chat, Gross will preview the upcoming WSIS summit and discuss his views on why the current governance structure is the best way to preserve the nature of the Internet as an innovative medium. </p>
                <p class="style2">Gross will be available to answer questions at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT). To ask a question or make a comment, please register at iipchat@state.gov. Questions and comments are welcome in advance of and during the November 2 program. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">So there you have it &ndash; your chance to make your point to the man who will make the U.S.'s points in Tunis November 16-18, or at least your chance to see how he answers the opinions of those who do choose to ask questions and make comments. </p>
              <p class="style2">Either way, you can follow how things progress here at the <i>Standards Blog</i>, as I will cover the run up to, and the outcome of, the Tunis meeting in detail.  It's likely that I'll also dedicate the November issue of the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/">Consortium Standards Bulletin</a> to the same topic. </p>

              <p align="left" class="style56"> <strong> [][][] <strong> October 27, 2005</strong> </strong></p>
              <p><span class="style56">#33</span><strong class="style38"><em> Do Standards Matter? </em></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Yes, that&rsquo;s a rhetorical  question.&nbsp; But like a lot of things we  &ldquo;know,&rdquo; it is sometimes interesting to ask ourselves what, exactly, supports  what we are sure we know.</p>
              <p class="style2">I recently asked myself that  sort of question when I was notified that I would receive a standards-related  award, and that I would be expected to say a few words by way of an acceptance  speech.&nbsp; Since I like to present ideas  in an &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; fashion, I thought I would try this question out when I  stood in front of a room full of people who have spent most or all of their  professional careers developing standards.</p>
              <p class="style2">As hoped, it made an impact,  perhaps because I put into words what I suspect many of them had always sensed,  but which was too non-traditional for them to articulate.&nbsp; After all, standards are just dry, dusty,  boring specifications, are they not?</p>
              <p class="style2">I&rsquo;ve never thought so,  perhaps because I don&rsquo;t actually help create them.&nbsp; Instead, I help create the organizations that develop the  standards, and perhaps this enables me to focus more on the forest of meanings  and effects that standards represent, rather than on the pieces of paper  themselves.</p>
              <p class="style2">So here is what I said:</p>
              <p class="style2">I'm very pleased to be here  this evening to accept the 2005 ANSI President's Award for Journalism.&nbsp; As some of you may know, I am receiving this  award in recognition of my work at a website, ConsortiumInfo.org, and in a  monthly eJournal, the <em>Consortium Standards Bulletin</em>, now in its 33rd  issue.&nbsp; Each of these ventures is public  and free, and each addresses standards, standard setting (both SDO and  consortium-based), and the role of standards in society.</p>
              <p class="style2">You may wonder why, as a  full-time practicing attorney, I have spent over a thousand hours a year for  the past three and a half years in such a pursuit.&nbsp; There are two possible answers to that question.&nbsp; Since one reflects poorly on my mental  state, I will turn to the second, which is this:&nbsp; Because I believe that Standards Matter.</p>
              <p class="style2">Since I'm sure that all of  you already share that opinion, I would like to offer you three reasons that  may not have occurred to you before.</p>
              <p class="style2">The first reason I will  identify with the word &quot;Humanity.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">What I am suggesting by this  is that the type of standards that you and I work with are simply the latest  form of a tool that mankind has been creating since long before the dawn of  history.&nbsp; After all, what is a standard  but an abstraction that people voluntarily agree upon for a particular purpose.&nbsp; The first standards system may well have  been sign language: &quot;this sign means that thing,&quot; followed by spoken  words, then written words, then weights and measures, and eventually the types  of standards that we know and help create today &ndash;&nbsp; safety, performance and interoperability standards, and, most  recently, open source software &ndash; a new way to solve old problems.&nbsp; There is no question in my mind that there  will be other types of standards that will come into being in the future.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">It is hardly an exaggeration  to say that the creation of standards, like the creation of tools,  differentiates us from all other forms of life.&nbsp; To create standards, therefore, is inextricably intertwined with  the very concept of what it means to be human.</p>
              <p class="style2">The second reason I will  call &quot;Hope.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">What I wish to point out  with this word is that there is something important and unique about standard  setting:&nbsp; in what other process do  people from all backgrounds and from all nations come together to mutually  agree on matters of common concern, and then voluntarily bind themselves by  rules that restrict their freedom of action in order to make the world a more  productive and useful place?&nbsp; The United  Nations has had nowhere near the same success in its efforts, despite a vastly  greater budget and the official support of governments from all over the world.&nbsp; Surely there are lessons that national and  world governments can learn from the standard setting process that could have  great benefit to humanity as it struggles with the challenges of a shrinking  world.</p>
              <p class="style2">The last reason I will call  &quot;Service.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">There are on the order of a  million supported standards in the world today, and the value that they convey  is incalculable.&nbsp; With the extension of  the Internet and the Web to the third world &ndash; something that would be impossible  and unimaginable without standards &ndash; that value is about to multiply a hundred  fold, as everyone, everywhere, will gain equal access to the riches of science  and the arts, to unbiased accounts of history and current events, and to a  competitive education -- something that only twenty years ago would have been  an inconceivable goal to achieve even in the lifetimes of our children.</p>
              <p class="style2">And yet all of these  standards, old and new, have been created by a comparative handful of people,  unknown, unsung, and utilizing the most modest of resources.&nbsp; To be fortunate enough to be among those  that serve in this pursuit is, I believe, a privilege indeed.</p>
              <p class="style2">Thank you very much.</p>

The most recent critic is  Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican from Minnesota.

  <strong>Computer Business Review Online October 14, 2005</strong>&nbsp;--  Paul Mockapetris, who invented the internet&rsquo;s domain name system, was asked a  few years ago what else he wished he could have invented. He answered: &ldquo;A  directory system for the internet that wouldn't be controlled by the  politicians, lawyers and bureaucrats.&rdquo; Tough luck, Paul. Not only is the DNS  controlled by politicians, lawyers and bureaucrats, but politicians, lawyers  and bureaucrats from all over the world have been spending vast amounts of time  and effort arguing over which politicians, lawyers and bureaucrats should  control it in future. <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/blog.asp?show=cbr/2005/10/who_really_runs.html">...Full Story</a></p>

Such ideas have  gained significant support in recent years as potentially low-cost, easy-access  solutions for developing countries, but as they are put forward in the WSIS  context they are balanced by stronger calls for proprietary approaches. The  draft WSIS texts are lengthy and detailed, and intellectual property (IP)  issues play a comparatively small role overall, but the stakes are high enough  to draw top government IP officials and industry lobbyists to the meetings. <a href="http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=98&res=800&print=0">...Full  Story</a></p>

The  EWC includes some of the biggest players in wireless LANs, such as Intel,  Broadcom, Atheros Communications, and Cisco Systems. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,123045,00.asp">...Full Story</a></p>

There will be a wide range of interest  in the spectrum from the mobile voice, mobile data, and wireless broadband  industries. [Consultant] Mr. Nordgaard believes that the international  implications of the digital switchover and the reuse of spectrum have,  surprisingly, not been raised. &ldquo;Users will want to be able to use their  wireless broadband equipment abroad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If the U.S. uses spectrum A, and  Europe uses spectrum B, then having a roaming device becomes more costly.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14097&hed=Senate+Sets+Spectrum+Standard&sector=Industries&subsector=EntertainmentAndMedia">...Full Story</a></p>

  <strong>Forbes.com, October 19, 2005</strong>&nbsp;--  Columbia Law School Professor Eben Moglen wants to destroy the Federal  Communications Commission. Not as some kind of terrorist act, but because  technology is rapidly making it irrelevant. The agency might have made sense in  the 1920s, Moglen says, when it was formed to assign specific frequencies to  broadcasters so they wouldn't try to drown each other out by cranking up the transmitter  power. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/2005/10/18/open-source-software-FCC_cz_df_1018opensource.html">...Full Story</a></p>

More than any other  suite, OpenOffice.org 2.0 gives users around the globe the tools to be engaged  and productive members of their society. Available in 36 languages, with more  on the way, and able to run natively on Windows, GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac OS  X (X11) and several other platforms, OpenOffice.org banishes software  segregation and isolation and dramatically levels the playing field. And, with  its support for the OASIS Standard OpenDocument format, OpenOffice.org  eliminates the fear of vendor lock in or format obsolescence. The OpenDocument  format can be used by any office application, ensuring that documents can be  viewed, edited and printed for generations to come. <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/press/2.0/press_release.html">...Full Story</a></p>

  <strong>VNUnet.com October 4, 2005  --</strong>&nbsp;Sun  Microsystems has promised not to enforce any of its patents covering the  OpenDocument format. The Oasis Open Document Format for Office Applications is  a standard backed by Adobe, IBM and Sun....Sun's patent support for  OpenDocument is different from a move the company made earlier this year, in  which it pledged 1,670 patents in support of any software governed by the open  source Common Development and Distribution Licence.Simon Phipps, Sun's chief  open source officer, said: &quot;Previous attempts at patent protection using  the 'patent commons' approach glorify patents, forcing anyone who would benefit  from the apparent protection to become a patent expert. A blanket statement  like this just says: 'no need to look, you're safe.'&quot; <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2143045/sun-throws-patent-weight-behind">...Full Story</a></p>

  <strong>InformationWeek, October 9, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- How do you compete against Microsoft in  the office- productivity software market? You could give up, like WordPerfect  did long ago. Or you could try harder, as Sun has done. Sun Microsystem's  StarOffice 8 Office Suite gives users a similar word- and number-crunching  experience to Microsoft Office, but adheres to open standards, runs on Linux  and Solaris (as well as Windows), and costs less than $100. <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=171203641">...Full Story</a></p>

  <strong>Techworld October 22, 2005</strong>&nbsp;The  lightweight access point protocol (LWAPP) is back from the dead. It is now the  leading proposal for multi-vendor wireless LANs, according to an IETF standards  group. In 2003, network managers wanting a wireless LAN to cover their building  were offered wireless switches as an alternative to stringing together  standalone access points. The switches were often criticised because the  &quot;thin&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; access points they used were proprietary. <a href="http://www.techworld.com/networking/news/index.cfm?NewsID=4629">...Full Story</a></p>

The Molecular  Interaction XML interchange standard is already widely used, and all of the  major publicly available databases now make data available in this format [1].  Five of these databases -- BIND, DIP, IntAct, MINT, and MPact (MIPS) -- have  formed the International Molecular Exchange consortium to jointly curate and  exchange data, with data exchange commencing early in 2006. <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/newsitems/2005/sept2005/09-29-05-news-hupo">...Full Story</a></p>

Sadly,  perhaps, almost nobody noticed.&nbsp;  Researchers and vendors launched the I3C with the noble goal of  developing interoperability standards for the life sciences that would make it  easier to access, exchange, and share data&hellip;.So why did the I3C just vanish with  so little fanfare?
