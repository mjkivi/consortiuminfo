                  <p align="left" class="style2">In the last issue I wrote  about a number of &quot;unruly&quot; areas of standards development focused on  digital home technology.&nbsp; In this issue,  I return to the  theme of conflict, in order to explore when energetic competition in  standard setting is good, and when it is destructive.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This month's <strong><em>Editorial </em></strong>begins by examining the extreme case &ndash; the all-out effort to set a <em>de  facto</em> standard in order to wrest the maximum rewards possible from a market  niche.&nbsp; As with traditional war, the  risks can be as formidable as the potential rewards are great, providing a  cautionary example that leads most stakeholders to pursue the less-risky course  of participating in group standard setting instead.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong> in this month's issue takes a  broader approach, reviewing the situations  in which standards competitions can be beneficial, the ways in which skirmishes  and escalations can help parties to eventually achieve consensus (albeit  through clenched teeth), and the situations in which a standards war is likely  to succeed or fail.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In the <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> entry for this month, I look at a different type of conflict &ndash; between vendor  rights and the public interest, as it is seen (in this case) by the French  legislature, which has decided that no American company (e.g., Apple) has the  right to prevent a Frenchman, through the use of digital rights management  software, from deciding on what type of device he will listen to <em>La  Marseillaise </em>(or Eminem, as the case may be).&nbsp; But if a legislature can decree that music data must be open, why  stop there?&nbsp; And what may come next?</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">I continue on a similar  theme in my <strong><em>Consider This&hellip;</em></strong> piece for March, noting several  examples where the private sector is extending the open source concept to other  areas of endeavor besides software development.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As usual, I follow with a  selection of what struck me as the most interesting and important standards  news of the past month.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, a correction to the  Feature Article of the January issue, in which I mistakenly referred to <a href="http://www.thinkfire.com/">ThinkFire Services USA</a> as an example of a  company that has been &quot;formed for the sole purpose of purchasing, and asserting,  patents against operating companies&quot; (often pejoratively referred to as a  &quot;troll&quot;).&nbsp; That statement was  based on a characterization found in a story in the <em>Wall Street Journal that </em>was misleading.&nbsp; In fact, ThinkFire  does not purchase patents, but acts as a service provider to operating  companies that patent their technology, and&nbsp;  I apologize for the error. </p>
                  <div align="left" class="style2">As  always, I hope you enjoy this issue.&nbsp;</div>

MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION
</strong></p>
              <p align="center" class="style10"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></strong></font></p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">With the  destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs, the world entered a new  era of uncertainty and strategic readjustment.&nbsp;  For a few years thereafter, the West rested easy, secure in the knowledge that only  the United States possessed the ability to use this new weaponry.&nbsp; Soon, however, not only Britain and France,  but also the Soviet Union, and later, China had mastered the new technology as  well.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The  acquisition of nuclear devices by these nations was the first tactical reaction  to the possession by the United States of a powerful new strategic weapon.&nbsp; Merely achieving parity in technology did  not constitute a strategy, however, but only the ability to incorporate a new  weapon into a strategy that needed to adapt to a world that was changing in  many ways.&nbsp; But how could such an  enormously destructive weapon be incorporated into any rational strategic plan?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">For all  but the Soviet Union and the United States, the default decision was to  manufacture and deploy a sufficient number of weapons to ensure that any  invasion of the homeland would be prohibitively costly, and to augment that  strategy through alliances with other nations, some of which themselves  controlled nuclear weapons.&nbsp; But the  United States and the Soviet Union were soon locked into what became known as  the &quot;nuclear arms race.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This  competition, many would agree, was fueled more by fear than reason, and often  by internal politics.&nbsp; The result was  that by the end of the 1960's, each country was theoretically capable of  destroying the other many times over.&nbsp;  In point of fact, not all warheads would penetrate the defenses of the  opponent, but the excess of destructive capability amply demonstrated that no  amount of defensive technology could ever reliably protect the homeland from  such a massive and overpowering assault.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The  label given to this drastic strategy, in the emotionless parlance of the Cold  War, was &quot;mutually assured destruction,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; a name that yielded an appropriate acronym: MAD.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Happily,  nuclear weapons were never used by the two Cold War superpowers, and any war  waged directly between the two nations became impossibly risky, due to the  possibility of uncontrolled escalation.&nbsp;  Unhappily, much of the world became an ideological battleground for the  two adversaries instead, as each sought to spread its influence in emerging  nations in order to secure allies and foster its own political ideology.&nbsp; The result was a series of proxy wars  conducted in many nations, each with one of the two superpowers supporting one  side to prevent the ally of the other from emerging  incrementally more powerful than before.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Throughout  this whole mindless period, there were few, if any, winners, and many  losers.&nbsp; Perhaps the best that could be  said was that it could have been much worse &ndash; and may yet be in the future,  either between these two powers, or some other pairing of rivals that have  joined the nuclear club.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The  lesson of Mutually Assured Destruction is instructive in many areas of life,  from politics to standard setting.&nbsp; When  rationality is retained, it usually becomes clear that the risks of losing so  outweigh the benefits that can possibly be gained from winning that another strategy  ultimately appears  to be more desirable.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In the  standards world, the phrase &quot;standards war&quot; is bandied about  freely.&nbsp; In fact, only a very small  percentage of standards are ever deliberately set in direct competition with  each other in &quot;winner take all&quot; settings.&nbsp; Instead, many confrontations between opposing groups could more  accurately be described as &quot;standards competitions.&quot;&nbsp; Nor are such contests necessarily  destructive, especially in the field of emerging technology, where it is often  unclear which technologies will be developed successfully, or which may prove  to be best suited to address market needs that are themselves still emerging.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In such  a situation, standards are  developed in real time, coincident with the  technologies that they are intended to enable.&nbsp;  Typically, only some of these standards will ever become widely adopted,  but the marketplace benefits from the immediate availability of those that do,  because the technologies they serve may be immediately introduced into  networked settings.<br>
                  <br>
                  Occasionally  a true standards war of MAD proportions does break out, most commonly among the  giants of the consumer electronics sector, which seem constitutionally committed  to driving not only themselves to the brink of destruction in lemming-like  cycles, but also to dragging content providers, distributors, video rental  stores and end-users up to, and sometimes over, the precipice with them as well.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">If there  is any value to the phenomenon of MAD standards wars, it is their cautionary  impact.&nbsp; Just as the horror of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki created a powerful taboo against the use of nuclear weapons that  has never (yet) been broken, the commercially destructive spectacle of an irrational  standards war makes clear how mad a strategy is being pursued, providing  incentives to those in other sectors to follow a more rational and beneficial  way.</p>

              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Introduction:</em></strong>&nbsp;Standards wars have become a commonplace in today's world, even to those that do not recognize them as such.  Almost anyone would immediately understand the meaning of a standards war if any of the following simple phrases was offered as an example: "VHS vs. Betamax," "Internet Explorer vs. Netscape Navigator," or "PC vs. Macintosh."  While each of these examples refers to a battle between the proponents of proprietary products in order to create a "de facto" standard (i.e., a nearly universally adopted technical format, interface or architecture controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors), such conflicts represent only the more extreme and visible examples of a process that plays out in countless consortia and accredited standards development organizations (SDOs) on a constant basis.</p>
              <p class="style2">As the modern world has  become more and more dependent on information and communications technology  (ICT), standards have become more essential, and therefore more valuable.&nbsp; With that perception of value has come a  greater interest in the exact composition of such standards, since the  elements, and even the timing of release, of such standards can have profound  competitive effects on stakeholders, both positive and negative.</p>
              <p class="style2">Not surprisingly, the level  of attention and involvement invested by those that are most affected by the  development and implementation of standards continues to increase, as does the  interest of the same players in influencing the outcome of the standards  development process.&nbsp; This focus has led  to the development of a range of strategies, each of which is appropriate to  particular circumstances.</p>
              <p class="style2">In this article, I will  describe some of the principle motivations for influencing the standards  development and implementation process, the strategies that have evolved over  time to achieve that influence, and the types of outcomes that result from this  ongoing process.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Historical background:</em></strong>&nbsp; Standards,  broadly construed, such as languages, alphabets and numbering systems have been  created since time immemorial.&nbsp; These  standards evolved gradually and outside of formal processes, but nonetheless  had great value. Over time, it came to be recognized that the control of a  standard could convey the right to be compensated for the use of that  standard.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">An early example of this  realization gave rise to a word we still use today &ndash; &quot;royalty.&quot;&nbsp; A royalty, as first conceived, referred to  the share of a precious metal that was retained by the crown when the balance  was turned into coinage, and the service that was being compensated was the  state's guarantee (not always reliable) of the purity of the metal of which the  coin was made, and therefore the intrinsic value of the coin itself.</p>
              <p class="style2">With the advent of the  industrial age, the need for standards expanded dramatically, as better systems  of weights and measures became desirable for scientific purposes, expanding  trade increased the need for uniformity across borders, new industrial  techniques relied on interchangeable parts, and new networks &ndash; railroads,  telecommunications and power transmission systems &ndash; demanded consistent  measures in everything from track and wire gauges to time itself, the latter  leading to the modern system of time zones.</p>
              <p class="style2">Each of these new standard  systems presented the opportunity for interested parties to win or to  lose.&nbsp; To use railways as an example,  governmentally enforced standardization of gauges avoided the costly and time  consuming process of transferring freight from the cars of one railway owner to  those of the owner of the adjacent line, but also helped to erode the monopoly  of each of the owners.</p>
              <p class="style2">Standardization could also  bring commoditization.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, such a depreciation occurred first in the area  of items such as bolts and nuts, where the cost of standardization was low and  the benefit was high.&nbsp; When technology  eventually made the production of interchangeable parts feasible, mass production  logically followed, creating new situations where standards could be both  beneficial and threatening, depending upon the stakeholder.</p>
              <p class="style2">The  automotive industry provides an interesting example of this phenomenon:&nbsp; </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">Between 1904 and 1908, more than 240 companies entered the fledgling automotive business. In 1910 there was a mini-recession, and many of these entrants went out of business. Parts suppliers realized that it would be much less risky to produce parts that they could sell to more than one manufacturer. Simultaneously, the smaller automobile manufacturers realized that they could enjoy some of the cost savings from economies of scale and competition if they also used standardized parts that were provided by a number of suppliers. <a href="#1">1</a> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">The authors go on to note  that not all automobile manufacturers perceived standardization of parts as  being in their best interest.&nbsp; The most  powerful &ndash; Ford and General Motors &ndash; were large enough to achieve comparable benefits  entirely within their own operations.&nbsp;  In consequence, industry-wide agreement on interchangeable parts would  provide them no significant benefits, while at the same time minimizing the  advantages that their economies of scale would otherwise provide to them over  their smaller rivals.</p>
              <p class="style2">This differential in costs  and benefits between the &quot;incumbent&quot; (i.e., the dominant payer in a  product space) and its competitors continues to breed outright standards wars  and lesser skirmishes today.&nbsp; But this  is only one of many dynamics in the marketplace, as we shall now explore.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>War and peace:</em></strong>&nbsp; The existence of standards wars may, at first blush, seem oxymoronic.  After all, the reason for having a standard at all (and especially a standard created to permit interoperability between products) is to create a marketplace for products that might not otherwise exist.  This is achieved by convincing the market that it need not worry over the following issues:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Will the standard become widely adopted by       vendors?</u></em>&nbsp;  If I buy, for example, a telephone, will my friends buy one, too?  If multiple vendors and service providers announce that they will provide the interoperable products and infrastructure, then I have reasonable assurance that my telephone will prove to be a wise investment.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Will the standardized product become ubiquitous</u></em>?&nbsp;       Economists focus on the value of the "network effect," which notes that the network becomes of exponentially increasing value to each participant as the network grows.  For example, the value of a telephone to its owner increases by the addition of new categories (friends, catalog companies, first responders, etc.) as well as by the number of users. <a href="#2">2</a> </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Will the standard remain supported over time</u></em>?&nbsp; If a standardized product is superseded quickly by a new product generation, the user at minimum may face an upgrade cost (as when rotary telephones were superseded by push button models, but remained backwardly compatible), and at worst abandonment, or "stranding" (as when video stores ceased stocking Betamax video titles).</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Will prices be reasonable and alternatives       interesting</u></em>?&nbsp; With wide adoption  economies of manufacturing scale predictably lead to price and feature competition.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Where this messaging is  convincing, it becomes possible to sell new products, even to the first  customers.&nbsp; In the beginning, it may be  necessary to make early sales at a loss, in order to build a sufficiently large  network to generate sustaining momentum.&nbsp;  Thereafter, however, it should be possible to earn back this investment  through falling production costs and increasing sales at higher prices.&nbsp; A current example of this practice is the  competition between two competing satellite radio systems, each of which has  budgeted substantial, multi-year losses in order to price their initial  services attractively.</p>
              <p class="style2">Although the simple analysis above is sound, there are many different strategies for achieving broad adoption of a standard, each with its own balance of risk to reward.</p>
              <p class="style2">At one extreme, there is the  &quot;winner take all&quot; approach, in which a single vendor (or group of  vendors) succeeds not only in establishing a standard, but also (most  typically) through patent protection, ensuring that no other vendor may share  in the benefits, absent a license and payment of a share of the resulting  profit.&nbsp; As a generality, the risks of  expensive failure are greatest with this approach, unless the player is already  dominant in the same market.&nbsp; When this  strategy does succeed, the result is a so-called &quot;de facto&quot;  standard.&nbsp; Examples of such standards  include the winners in the examples given in the first paragraph of this  article: the VHS video format, the Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) Web  browser, and the &quot;WinTel&quot; (i.e., Microsoft/Intel) personal computer  system. </p>
              <span class="style2">At  the opposite end of the spectrum is the formal consensus-based standards  development process, the output of which is referred to as a &quot;de  jure&quot; standard (if developed by an SDO) or simply a standard or specification  (if by a consortium).&nbsp; The minimum  attributes of this type of standard are open participation of all interested  parties, and the ability of both non-members as we well as members to implement the standard on &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory&quot;  (or &quot;RAND&quot;) terms.&nbsp;  Increasingly, standards created by both SDOs and consortia are referred  to simply as &quot;open standards.&quot;<a href="#3">3</a>                            </span>
              <p class="style2">Although these examples may  appear to represent completely different realities, there is in fact ample  opportunity for gamesmanship at both ends of the spectrum, and at every  gradation in between.&nbsp; The goal of such  maneuvering is to have the greatest influence on the resulting standard, while  still achieving wide adoption.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Standards skirmishes,  escalations, and declarations of war:</em></strong>&nbsp; The attractiveness of  controlling a de facto standard is clear, since it conveys upon the individual  company, or group of allied companies, the ability to command large profits  either through high margins based on a monopolist vendor advantage, or through  indirect means through licensing income (or, ideally, both).&nbsp; The motivations that sometimes lead to a  standards war more often inspire more subtle and varied behaviors that might  better be characterized as &quot;standards skirmishes,&quot; as they do not  result in the introduction of competing standards into the marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Skirmishes:</em></strong>&nbsp;The following are typical of the reasons that  stakeholders enter into a skirmish, as compared to a war:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Direct licensing revenue</u>:</em>&nbsp;The SDO world, and most consortia, do not  prohibit the inclusion of intellectual property rights (IPR) in a standard,  even if the result would be that an implementer would be required to pay a  royalty or other fee for the privilege of implementing the standard.&nbsp; While many standard setting organizations  (SSOs) of each type actively try to avoid this result, others are quite  tolerant to the creation of standards that, if implemented, would infringe upon  patents owned by members.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result,  there can be active competition among members in such an SSO to steer an  evolving standard into infringement of a contestant's patent.&nbsp; In organizations where this result is not  considered to be desirable, such conduct still can occur on a more covert  basis.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Indirect licensing revenue</u>:</em>&nbsp;While virtually all well-run SSOs have IPR  policies that require the licensing of &quot;necessarily infringed&quot; patent  claims&nbsp; (i.e., those claims in member  owned or controlled patents that would be unavoidably infringed by the required  portions of a standard), most do not impose the same requirements on  &quot;optional&quot; elements of a specification (i.e., elements that are not  required for a full implementation, or, in some SSOs, which represent multiple  alternatives for satisfying a single required element).&nbsp; The result is the opportunity to steer a  standard under development in a direction that does not require either  disclosure or a commitment to RAND terms, but may leave implementers either  very likely to seek a royalty-bearing license, or with no choice but to do so  (imagine a standard for all of the basic parts of a bicycle that does not  include descriptions of reflectors, multiple gearing assemblies, and other  desirable but non-essential features).</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Indirect benefits</u>:</em>&nbsp;Many standards are based on specifications that  describe existing products, or elements of products, being produced by members  and submitted to an SSO.&nbsp; While the  member must then license others to manufacture and sell the same products, the  submitter may reap an almost endless variety of advantages, such as a head  start in selling its own product into a wider market, undercutting the product  of a competitor, increasing its own sales of a related (and patented) product,  gaining credibility, steering a market in the direction of its own strategic  plan, and so on.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Escalations</em></strong>: Each  of the objections described above can provide the basis for an outright war at  the outset, or can be achieved during the standards development  process through multiple strategies, including alliance  building, &quot;horse trading&quot; (both open and covert), and escalation of confrontations.&nbsp; The last named occurs when factions within a  working group become polarized and consensus becomes increasingly difficult to  achieve.&nbsp; Given that participation is  voluntary, the implied, or open, threat to withdraw and launch a competing  standard carries real weight, and the methods of signaling determination have  become more elaborate in some SSOs where the imprimatur of the organization is  valuable and each faction still hopes to prevail within the system.</p>
              <p class="style2">This type of behavior has  become increasingly common in the IEEE working groups that create new standards  within the 802 family of wireless standards.&nbsp;  In recent years, the rival factions that have formed within some of  these  working groups have created their own extrinsic organizations to marshal  support for their respective submissions in an increasingly rough and tumble  process.&nbsp; </p>
              <span class="style2">Recently,  this type of skirmish resulted in the ultimate failure of the IEEE 802.15.31  task developing an Ultrawideband standard, which failed to achieve consensus  and eventually disbanded in defeat.&nbsp; During  the lifetime of the task group, 25 separate proposals were narrowed to just  two, but the patent holders of those submissions founded supporting groups &ndash;  the UWB Forum and the WiMedia Alliance &ndash; that ultimately divided the  membership.&nbsp; The result is that each of  these groups is taking the products based upon their respective incompatible  specifications into the marketplace.&nbsp; In  short, a customer-confusing standards war that will slow adoption for all, and  may ultimately leave some subset of the marketplace stranded.<a href="#4">4</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Wars</em></strong>:&nbsp;A full-fledged standards war  is most likely to occur as a result of either opportunity, prevailing practice  within a given market area, or the lack of alternatives for displacing an  incumbent.&nbsp; The following are examples  of each type of situation:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Opportunity</u>:</em>&nbsp;New markets provide great opportunities, often  to a broad range of competitors.&nbsp; When  such an opportunity requires agreement upon a standard in order for the rewards  to become real, the  strategy that is likely to be most successful for  a given market participant will depend on a variety of factors.&nbsp; For the largest players, an attempt to  establish a de facto standard may be most attractive, while the smallest  players may believe that the creation of a consensus standard may offer the  only viable opportunity to them to participate on substantially equal terms.&nbsp; In the absence of a single dominant player,  the result can be a hodge-podge of individual players striving for dominance as  well as several competing consortia, each seeking to establish its own standard  as the dominant route to new products.&nbsp;  An example of just such a confused situation arose in the case of  wireless home networks, where both WiFi (developed by the IEEE), Bluetooth  (developed by Nokia) and other specifications all vied to become the dominant  standard.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Prevailing practice</u>:</em>&nbsp; The pot of gold that is perceived in some       markets niches can be quite different than in others.&nbsp; For example, success in the world of       Internet and Web standards is defined by achieving global adoption of       fee-free, consensus-based standards.&nbsp;       In contrast, success in the consumer electronic space is often       defined by winner take all, &quot;take no prisoners&quot; battles to force       royalty-bearing, proprietary formats upon one's rivals.&nbsp; The result has been a series of       punishing standards wars that have always been grueling for the vendors       involved, and that have sometimes resulted in great cost for everyone in       the supply chain, from the losing vendor camp, to content owners,       distributors, retail store owners, and confused consumers (some number of       which ultimately find themselves abandoned).</li>
                </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Lack of an alternative</u>:</em>&nbsp;Despite the difficulty of displacing an  incumbent through introduction of a competing standard, this strategy has been  attempted on frequent occasions.&nbsp; Just  as an attack on an entrenched position is rarely made in broad daylight, a  standards-based assault on an incumbent is also most often attempted at a time  of perceived weakness on the part of the party that enjoys the monopoly position.&nbsp; That weakness can be the development of a  technology that may be better, faster and/or cheaper, or it can be a fortuitous  event.&nbsp; </li>
              </ul>
              <span class="style2">A current example of a standards war in this last category began with the latter was the adoption  by the Information Technology Division of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of  the OASIS OpenDocument Format (ODF) in September of 2005, but not the Open XML  Reference Schema that Microsoft had developed in connection with Microsoft  Office, the predominant office productivity software suite.&nbsp; The impact of the decision would be the  conversion of the state's c. 50,000 desktops to software that supports ODF,  which Microsoft announced Office would not do.&nbsp;  The result has been a broad push by companies such as IBM and Sun to  promote and support ODF, in order to lessen Microsoft's grip on the desktop. <a href="#5">5</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Settings for standards wars:</em></strong>&nbsp; Economists have studied competitive strategies in standard setting for some time, generating many articles on the topic. <a href="#6">6</a> Many detailed analysis focus on a limited number of common situations and strategies, such as displacing the incumbent <a href="#7">7</a> , or the motivations for governments to  intervene to achieve specific results. <a href="#8">8</a> In fact, the situations and  responsive strategies can be quite diverse, as demonstrated by the following  examples:</p>
              <p><span class="style2"><em><u>Exhausted market</u></em>:&nbsp;Marketplaces that are dependent upon standards  often become saturated and commoditized.&nbsp;  In order to provide new, higher-margin sales, a next generation product  is usually designed in order to boost both sales and profit margins.&nbsp; Often, by necessity or design, this will  also require that a new standard become established in the marketplace.&nbsp; As earlier noted, this is particularly  common in consumer electronics such as audio and video players, where each  successive wave of standards-based technology leads not only to the opportunity  to sell new devices, but new copies of old content as well.&nbsp; The long line of technologies in music in  just the last thirty years includes migrations from analog to digital recording  and reproduction, and from vinyl records through various types and intermediate  versions of tape, CD and DVD formats.&nbsp;  In each case, the move to a new generation of device has required common  agreement upon a new standard(s), as well as the opportunity (often seized) to  embark on a fresh standards war.</span></p>
              <p class="style2"><em><u>New technology</u>:</em>&nbsp;The advent of a new technology provides an  opportunity similar to that provided by a new generation of an existing  technology, but often with a greater incentive for cooperation, because the  intended customers must be persuaded that they will not be stranded if the  standard upon which the new product is based does not become widely  adopted.&nbsp; However, this does not  necessarily mean that the entire market will converge on a single standard.&nbsp; Often those that wish to exploit the new opportunity  clump into two or more camps, each with its own rival solution.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Strategies for standards  wars:</em></strong>&nbsp; A single standards war situation, such as &quot;displacing  the incumbent,&quot; can have quite a few variations in factual setting, each of which will lead to a different strategy.&nbsp; Consider the following:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><em><u>Displacement of the incumbent, where the  incumbent has more limited resources than the challenger</u></em>:&nbsp; In the case of Microsoft's displacement of  Netscape's Navigator, Microsoft had the economic resources to outspend and  outlast it's rival, since (unlike Netscape) it had other sources of revenue to  underwrite and sustain its attack.&nbsp;  Microsoft achieved victory in part not by seeking voluntary allies but  by using its market power to require its PC sales partners to include Internet  Explorer (IE) and not Navigator on the units that they sold.<u><em><br>

                <li class="style2"><em><u>Displacement of the incumbent in a growing  market</u></em>:&nbsp; The IE  &ndash; Navigator example demonstrates another significant situational dynamic: the  fact that it is easier to displace an incumbent in a rapidly growing market  than in a substantially saturated market niche.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Netscape enjoyed a seemingly insurmountable  90% market share among browser users in 1995 and IE had made little, if any,  market penetration at that point, Microsoft's market share expanded to 39% by  1997, even though most discriminating users believed Navigator to  still be the superior product.&nbsp; By  August of 1999, the market shares of IE and Navigator had inverted, with IE  claiming 76% to Navigator's 23%.&nbsp; The  very great majority of the systems that were using IE, of course, were new  systems that came with IE pre-installed. <a href="#9">9</a> <br>

                <li class="style2"><span class="style2"><em><u>Displacement of the incumbent in a mature  market, where the incumbent has great resources</u></em>:&nbsp; For decades, Intel has dominated the  independent microprocessor manufacturing world, a situation that has become  more pronounced as the world moved from minicomputers and mainframes running  proprietary operating systems to hardware using the more similar variations of  UNIX, such as IBM's AIX and Hewlett-Packards HP-UX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with this situation, vendors tried various  standards-based strategies over the years in an attempt to regain ground.&nbsp; <u><em><br>

                  <p class="style2">One  such effort to establish an alternative operating system in the marketplace was  an attempt to convince customers that a new type of chip architecture, called  &quot;RISC&quot; (for Reduced Instruction Set Computer), was sufficiently  superior to Intel chips that switching platforms was desirable.&nbsp; The first effort to be launched was 88open  Consortium LTD, launched by Motorola to promote its 8800 RISC chip <a href="#10">10</a>.&nbsp; Data General, Encore Computers, Harris Corporation, and  Omron, among other hardware companies, supported the effort.&nbsp; Sun Microsystems announced a similar  organization, called SPARC International, to promote its own RISC architecture.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style2">Each  organization was intended to provide incentives to independent software vendors  (ISVs) to port their software to the new environment promoted that that consortium, so that customers would  have a rich variety of applications to run on their new systems if they made  the switch.&nbsp; A subsequent effort, called  PowerOpen, was launched by Motorola, IBM and Apple several years later, with   a similar goal and based upon the PowerPC line of chips that each of the  three companies was cross-licensed to fabricate.&nbsp; Despite significant funding and effort, none of these efforts was  successful in achieving its stated goals: the 88000 chip line never became  widely used, while the PowerPC achieved success on the desktop only in the  Apple Macintosh, although it was more successful in embedded systems.&nbsp; The SPARC processor continues to power Sun's  own products (and is still used by Fujitsu), but did not become a broader  threat to Intel.&nbsp; In all of these cases,  Intel's resources, alliances (including Microsoft) and dominant installed base  proved too difficult to dislodge.&nbsp; </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">This set of examples  illustrates a number of dynamics: first, that different strategies are  appropriate to different fact settings, despite the fact that the categorical  goal is the same.&nbsp; Second, as in war, a  head-on assault of a powerful opponent in a well-established defensive position  is apt to be both expensive in resources and unlikely to succeed, even where  the attacker arguably has the superior weaponry.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>The &quot;good&quot;  standards war:</em></strong>&nbsp; It is tempting to assume that standards wars  are inherently wasteful and destructive.&nbsp;  Perhaps surprisingly, that opinion is not universally held &nbsp;(especially among economists),  and the  reasons are several.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">The first  is that  standards (and especially very detailed standards) can limit the amount of innovation  that can spring up around a given product or service concept.&nbsp; As a result, there is an inherent tension  between optimizing the desirable aspects of standardization (e.g.,  interoperability, ease of integration, and so on) and flexibility in  implementation.&nbsp; If the balance tips too  far in terms of rigidity, technology may stagnate, or the standard may not  become widely adopted.&nbsp; On the other hand, if  it is weighted too far in favor of flexibility, the specification may not be  seen as being sufficiently useful, and once again it may be ignored in the  marketplace.&nbsp; If the standard is  ignored, then the only alternative is for a rival standard to be created by  another SSO, or for a de facto standard to become recognized by default.</p>
              <p class="style2">Similarly, while the concept of a standard can be good, a given standard can be "bad," either because it is poorly drafted, expensive to implement, not backwardly compatible or likely to be compatible with future products, and so on.<a href="#11">11</a> A frequent criticism of the  consensus process, when taken too far, is that &quot;lowest common  denominator&quot; standards can be released that are too late and too poorly  regarded to be taken seriously.&nbsp; If such  an outcome becomes apparent to participants in the process in question, then  better a standards war than stick with a doomed standard. </p>
              <p class="style2">Timing and maturity of  technology and marketplaces can also dictate whether a standards war is apt to  be destructive or, indeed, constructive.&nbsp;  This is because once a standard becomes broadly adopted, it is usually difficult  and expensive to replace it with a better standard that would allow superior  technology to be made available to users &ndash; in other words, the user becomes  &quot;locked in&quot; to an inferior solution.&nbsp;  As a result, when an emerging technology becomes standardized too soon,  the result can be a market that has become locked in by a standard that may be  &quot;good&quot; technically, but &quot;bad&quot; in the sense that an  opportunity to develop and deploy a better technology was lost.</p>
              <p class="style2">This result may sound unfortunate rather than  dire, but in fact the effects of lock-in on the wrong technology can be  profound.&nbsp; Where the investment of  infrastructure that surrounds the technology upon which the standard is based  is very great, the lock-in can not only last for more than a century, but can  have a potentially disastrous global impact &ndash; as with the early standardization  of the automotive industry on the gasoline engine, rather than the electric or  steam powered alternatives that were largely abandoned, but might have resulted  in far less global warming, as well as in greater choices of energy sources. <a href="#12">12</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">As a result, some standards &quot;wars&quot;  should probably not be called &quot;wars&quot; at all, due to the pejorative  implication &ndash; &quot;competitions&quot; would be a more appropriate term.</p>
              <span class="style2">Judgments about when standards wars are  beneficial or unjustified can therefore be both situational, as well as  subjective.&nbsp; A frequently cited example  of differing opinions on the &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness&quot; of a  standards war is the divergent approach to standardization of second-generation  mobile telephone standards in the United States and in Europe.&nbsp; In Europe, a decision was made to  standardize early on a single standard, while in the United States, the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) opted to allow the several competing technologies  promoted by market competitors to vie for adoption.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, mobile telephony spread more quickly in Europe  than in the U.S., and European mobile phone users could use their phones in  every service area while their American counterparts achieved the same degree  of coverage only gradually. <a href="#13">13</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">Looked at objectively, early  standardization is most valuable when the generation of technology in question  is likely to be of short duration.&nbsp; As a  result, the period of benefit is maximized, and the impact of selecting an inferior standard is minimized due to  the short period of the lock-in.&nbsp;  Conversely, where the period of lock-in can be very long (as in the  automotive technology example), the extra disruption of a standards competition  may be amply rewarded over time.</p>
              <span class="style2">Lock-in  can endanger innovation in other ways as well.&nbsp;  Market needs as well as technology can evolve rapidly, and particularly  so when new technologies are reaching the marketplace.&nbsp; For example, multiple medium range wireless  standards were developed and promoted to enable home networks and to meet other.&nbsp; As these needs and the strengths and  weaknesses of each technology became better understood, some (but not all) of  the original standards found their own market niches, and additional standards  were developed to fill in where none of the original standards excelled.&nbsp; Today, all of the following wireless  standards can easily be found in the same home:&nbsp; WiFi, Bluetooth and Near Field Communications &ndash; and more are on the  way. <a href="#14">14</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">As a result, government  intervention to mandate standardization through its regulatory power tends to  arise most often in traditional areas of government involvement in everyday  life, such as public health and safety, where the need for effective standards,  as well as their enforcement, is immediate and ongoing.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong>&nbsp; For better  or worse, standards skirmishes, escalations and wars are likely to be always  with us.&nbsp; Such activity can occur at all  levels and at every stage in the standards development process, and can involve  both <em>de facto</em> as well as <em>de jure</em> standards.&nbsp; As with natural selection, a marketplace  that enables the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; of standards can have  positive as well as negative effects, but the venue within which the conflict  occurs can have a bearing on whether or not the survivor is the fittest.&nbsp; For this reason, standards wars, while  sometimes destructive in the short term, may be more beneficial in the long term  than a skirmish within an SSO that may be won or lost through the formation of  alliances rather than in recognition of the superior quality of the victorious  standard.</p>

              <p align="center" class="style10"><strong>A NEW FRENCH REVOLUTION?</strong></p>
              <p align="left" class="style56"><strong>March  21, 2006 @ 09:34 EST</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">If you follow technology news or music news (or  both), you&nbsp;will be aware that an amendment to an on-line copyright bill  was adopted today in the French legislature that would make it <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/17/76593_HNfranceitunes_1.html">legal to thwart</a> the digital rights  protection (DRM) software of the fabulously successful Apple iTunes/iPod  system.&nbsp; In the run up to that vote,  Apple stated that if  the law passed, it might no longer offer French  customers the ability to purchase music from its iTunes site.<br>
                  <br>
                This is pretty juicy news, and therefore most of the press reports have focused  on the commercial consequences for Apple and other vendors if the law were to  go into effect. In fact, the new law could have a profound impact on the world  of commerce and standards, extending well beyond DRM and the control of audio  content. </p>
              <p class="style2">                The underlying politics of the new law, of course, are more  protectionist than profound. The French are not fond of being controlled in any  way from abroad, and have passed legislation many times in the past to protect  everything from local industries to the French language. In this case, they are  touting what they refer to as <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-6051495.html">&quot;economic patriotism.&quot;</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">                Notwithstanding such jingoist motivations, the actual consequences  of such a shift in intellectual  property rights (IPR) could be very wide reaching. The reason is this: the  gist of the law is that the music  you buy should not be held captive within  any proprietary system. In short, that content  should be transportable to other  systems, so that the purchaser is not put to the choice of remaining the  customer of a single vendor or abandoning her investment. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Of course, there is nothing unique about music, from a legal  perspective. Why not movies and electronic books? And why stop with content one  buys, and not also include content that one creates, including photos and  documents that must be archived in software created by for-profit vendors?&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                While the effects of the French law could be revolutionary, the  legal significance of the legislation would be merely evolutionary. The reason  is that the law simply expands an existing exception to the copyright laws as  they relate to software. That exception works as follows: normally, the law  bars the use of a copyrighted work for any purpose other than those that are  permitted by the owner of the software in the license agreement that the  end-user must acknowledge. One of the purposes that is always barred in  non-open source licenses is using the product in order to reverse engineer it. </p>
              <p class="style2">                But under the existing copyright exception, there is a limited  right to reverse engineer solely for the purpose of achieving interoperability  with other products. This right has been permitted in Europe for some time. </p>
              <p class="style2">                The new law widens this exception significantly, however, to  provide the right to reverse engineer not only for the purpose of enabling  interoperability at the device level, but to liberate data as well.&nbsp; In short, if your device is not  interoperable, your content must be. </p>
              <p class="style2">                As already suggested, the intriguing question thus becomes: having  made this breach in a copyright owner's rights, where does one stop?&nbsp; If an end user has a right to transport  musical content absolutely, should they not also have the right to carry their  documents from one system to another, with formatting and other useful  attributes intact? </p>
              <p class="style2">                If so, imagine what this would mean for products such as Microsoft  Office (or any other office productivity software). Microsoft has already  submitted its XML Reference Schema to Ecma as a result of a commercial  decision. But if the underlying concept behind the proposed French legislation  takes hold, would Microsoft have really had any choice in the matter, in order  to preempt a user's right to reverse engineer one of its most profitable  products?&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, if the French  government thinks that Apple should be barred from placing rap singers in  bondage, should not works of literature, philosophy, and science be similarly  protected by law?</p>
              <p class="style2">                If so, a more difficult question necessarily arises: who will decide  how &quot;open&quot; (because that is what we are really talking about here) a  product must be before anyone becomes entitled to reverse engineer it to make  the content it creates or holds more accessible? </p>
              <p class="style2">                Should the law continue  to evolve in this direction, then the decisions that  proprietary vendors would make about their products might change  dramatically.&nbsp; For example, if a vendor  must surrender the right to protect its content anyway, then it might as well  seek the full benefit that standards can bring and promote its openness, rather  than fight a constant, rearguard action against those that would otherwise  challenge its degree of legal compliance. </p>
              <p class="style2">                More cynically, a vendor might as well try and control the  standards process, allying with other vendors, to create standards that would  be respected by the law as meeting the minimum requirements of  interoperability, but otherwise conforming as closely as possible to its  commercial interests. In short, a vendor might as well follow the classic  military strategy of abandoning its more vulnerable forward defenses, and fall  back to rally its forces behind a more defensible, if more limited, perimeter. </p>
              <p class="style2">                It will be fascinating to watch this story unfold. If the French  law survives the inevitable court challenges, then there is the possibility  that other countries in the EU may emulate it. This would result in a dramatic  rebalancing of the rights equation between content owners and content users &ndash;  and, who knows &ndash; could spread from there. </p>
              <p class="style2">                But from there to where? </p>
              <p class="style2">                Well, why stop at content owners, or even software, and not speak  of end-users generally, and in favor of avoiding lock-in everywhere? Perhaps  even in operating systems and microprocessor designs? </p>
              <p class="style2">                Now <em>that</em> would be a revolution.</p>

              <p><span class="style56">#37</span><strong class="style38"><em> Where  (if anywhere) are the Boundaries of the Open Source Concept?	</em></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">To many that have spent their careers in technology, the concept  of open source software seems inside out and upside down.&nbsp; Create a product in order to give it  away?&nbsp; Where's the sense in that?&nbsp; How could anyone even suggest such a thing.</p>
              <p class="style2">                From another perspective, its odd that such a time-honored  practice should seem so strange, as we are surrounded by open source practices  that have been part of normal society for millennia.</p>
              <p class="style2"> If you greeted that contention with a blank stare, consider this&hellip;</p>
              <p class="style2"> Simply stated, the concept of open source is that something of  value can be created and made available for free under certain conditions,  which include the following:&nbsp; anyone can  use it (for free),  anyone can change it without restrictions on how, or for  what purpose and anyone can redistribute it with their changes.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> It may seem unrealistically altruistic to apply such rules to  commercial goods.&nbsp; But if we match these  same open source licensing terms up with many established non-commercial  systems &ndash; such as academic scholarship, the creation of legislation and the  application of case law by the courts &ndash; they map rather nicely.&nbsp; In each case, something of value is created;  that value is made freely available to all; anyone can create new academic work  (or laws, or judicial opinions) based on what came before, and the new work  product remains free and available.&nbsp;  And, like open source, each example is the result of a community effort.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Let's look at knowledge in greater detail as an example.&nbsp; No one &quot;owns&quot; math, science, art  history, or any other subject that is taught today.&nbsp; And yet millions of people are engaged in adding to our store of  knowledge in these areas.&nbsp; True, someone can  copyright the expression of an idea, but she can't copyright the idea  itself.&nbsp; Yes, patents can prevent you  from implementing a subset of useful ideas, but a patent can't stop you from  knowing about those ideas, all of which are public records.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> Still, the store of knowledge grows with every passing hour, added  to by scientists, philosophers, journalists and others.&nbsp; More and more of that  knowledge is available on the Web, bypassing the need to even spend a few  dollars on a book or journal.</p>
              <p class="style2"> So also with law, which resembles open source software even more  closely.&nbsp; Under the English common law  that forms the foundation for the legal  systems of the U.S. and the commonwealth countries (as well as England) judges are required to apply the rulings in prior cases to  similar factual settings in future cases, a doctrine called <em>stare decisis, </em>which  roughly translates as &quot;to abide by decided cases.&quot;&nbsp; As with open source, this provides economy  through re-use (write up  an opinion/write code once, use many times), certainty  and stability of outcome (I know how this trial should come out/ this code will operate  reliably), and an expanding pool of knowledgeable practitioners (attorneys and  judges/ engineers and integrators).&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> And yet, like open source software, the law is still allowed to  evolve over time &ndash; and in real time &ndash; either incrementally, (through  a single legal opinion) or in major  releases &ndash; as when the legislature passes a new law, or an open source project  issues a new release.&nbsp; And all laws are  free to be borrowed by one state from another, or by one country from another.</p>
              <p class="style2"> In fact, then, the open source concept is not so strange after  all.&nbsp; It just seems so, when we apply it  to an area where it was not common before.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Of course, it would be na&iuml;ve and misleading to deny that there is  another thread to human existence, which involves hoarding ideas for personal  advantage.&nbsp; That line of conduct  stretches forward from shamans and sorcerers, through alchemists and trade  guilds, and eventually to modern &quot;intellectual property&quot; laws.&nbsp; Such laws seek to balance the economic  interests of those that create such property with the benefit to society that  comes from sharing the same value.</p>
              <p class="style2"> In modern times, legal and political theorists have assumed that  absent a protected right (i.e., a legal monopoly) to reap payment for the labor  of creating an invention or a work of art that such useful items will not come  into existence.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"> But is this necessarily so?&nbsp;  If so, why do scientists so often publish rather than patent, and why  don't courts that try cases charge litigants a fee to &quot;use&quot; their  prior decisions?&nbsp; Moreover, why do  hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs launch new restaurants (most doomed to  failure), stores and services each year that have no proprietary protection at  all to guard their concepts against imitation?</p>
              <p class="style2"> In fact, as the open source software phenomenon demonstrates,  there may be little reason besides history and convention to explain why some  categories of ideas can be protected and sold, while others are happily given  away.&nbsp; If this is so (and I think that  it is), then it should not be a surprise if the open source concept begins to  appear not only feasible, but even attractive in areas in addition to software,  and in settings that involve not just patents, but copyrights and trade secrets  as well. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Such an eventuality becomes ever more likely as more and more  vendors adopt business models that are based upon selling goods and services in  connection with open source software, thus demonstrating that you don't have to  own something in order to find opportunities to profit as a result of its being  widely used.</p>
              <p class="style2"> In the last several days there have been several stories in the  news that highlight this increasing tension between the ownership of  intellectual property rights (IPR) and the opportunities that can arise  available when broader, free&nbsp;access to those rights is made  available.&nbsp; In each case, they illustrate a &quot;cross over&quot; of another  traditionally for-profit type of intellectual property to an open source  model.&nbsp; Call it a general movement  towards &quot;open IP.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">                The three articles that struck me as proving this point best were:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2">The announcement by Sun Microsystems that it had  released the design for its new UltraSPARC processor under the popular open  source, GNU General Public License (<a href="http://www.computingchips.com/pr/6035">GNU GPL</a>);</li>
                <li class="style2">A speech by Tim Berners-Lee to an Oxford  University audience in which he challenged the British government to make <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1736751,00.html">Ordinance Survey mapping data</a>&nbsp;available  at no cost for Web use; and</li>
                <li class="style2">News that a Dutch  court had upheld the validity of the <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39258529,00.htm">Creative Commons</a> license.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Each of these stories demonstrates a breach in traditional  thinking about the balance of value to an IPR owner between licensing  these rights for profit, and making&nbsp;those same rights  freely and publicly available.</p>
              <p class="style2">                In  the case of the Sun announcement, that breach is the transposition of the open  source methodology from software to silicon - a genetic leap, if you will, from  one species of technology to another.&nbsp; Tim Berners-Lee's challenge, on the  other hand, is an example of the increasingly popular concept that &quot;data  wants to be free,&quot; and that the greatest societal benefit may result from  allowing it to be so.&nbsp; And the court victory of the Creative Commons  license demonstrates that traditional legal concepts can be adapted to  successfully accommodate such new realities.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Notably, none of these pieces of news is, at this point in time,  either revolutionary or surprising.&nbsp; Not only did Sun announce its  intention to open source&nbsp;its UltraSPARC architecture on <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-12/sunflash.20051206.4.xml">December 6</a> of last year, but IBM  had taken a step partway down the same road last summer when it founded an  organization that would allow other companies to influence the architecture of  its <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060126125710951">venerable PowerPC processor</a>.  Similarly, Google has already made a wealth of geodata available through its <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google  Earth</a> project.&nbsp; That project is already being used in just the  type of creative ways (so called &quot;mashups&quot; and more) to which  Berners-Lee alluded in his Oxford speech.&nbsp; And finally, the use of the  Creative Commons has been expanding&nbsp;logarithmically on the Web for several  years now.</p>
              <p class="style2">                What this demonstrates is that the broad concept of open  source&nbsp;is extensible into many types of situations, and may be managed in  multiple ways.&nbsp; In the first case, the approach has moved from software to  chip designs, and the initiative is organized on an open source software  project model.&nbsp; In the second case, raw data is involved, and the delivery  mechanism is through public (the Ordinance Survey example) or private (the  Google example) means, for two entirely different motivations.&nbsp;  In&nbsp;the third case, it is works of authorship of all types (literary,  music, art, etc.) released by the individual author/owner, who may set the  boundaries of that access through the simple means of referring to a specific  variation of a publicly available license.</p>
              <p class="style2">                What&nbsp;this shows me is that the envelope of free use&nbsp;and  public availability of IPR will continue to be pushed in more and more  directions, and managed in more and more novel and situationally appropriate  ways.&nbsp; Crucial to this process will be the accumulating evidence in an  expanding number of domains that the owners of IPR may gain (indirectly) more  by giving than by selling (directly).</p>
              <p class="style2">                This is not as novel as might first be imagined.&nbsp; IPR can be  either a means to an end, when the desired end is profit, or it can be the end  itself, when the hoped-for result is increased knowledge &ndash; IPR for its own  sake, if you will.&nbsp; Or it can be  somewhere in between, as with academic scholarship which, when it is accepted  to be published, benefits the author by meeting the need to &quot;publish or  perish.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">                Similarly, in the first article, while Sun is making its chip  design publicly accessible, it will still benefit in other ways, such as  lowering the cost of innovation through the efforts of non-employees, and the  hoped-for increase in use of the processors it sells.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                In the case of the second article, the concept is that data that  has been gathered through public funds can become far more useful, and  societally beneficial, if it is freely available.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                In the final example of the Creative Commons license, the desired  end can be indirect profit (e.g., a musician can make her downloads free to the  public in order to broaden&nbsp;her fan base, leading to more and better paid  performance engagements as well as to royalties for commercial use of the same  music) to personal satisfaction, through spreading the author's ideas and  reaching kindred spirits (as with this blog) to being part of a like-minded  community and the gratification that can be enjoyed through achieving a common  goal (e.g., the Wikipedia).</p>
              <p class="style2">                As such examples accumulate in&nbsp;increasingly diverse areas  where IPR owners demonstrably gain by giving, it can be assumed that the owners  of IPR in&nbsp;still other areas will give thought to how the technique may be  adapted to their own IPR assets and situations.&nbsp; At some point, the  inevitable tipping point will be reached, following which all types of IPR  owners will automatically consider which world&nbsp;they wish their works to live  in - open or closed, or in both, depending upon the specific use or user  obtaining rights to use the IPR.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Is this inevitable?&nbsp; Personally, I think it is.&nbsp; This is  one of those examples where the Internet really <em>has</em> &quot;changed  everything.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                How?&nbsp; It would be too simplistic to point simply to the  &quot;network effect&quot; (i.e., the value of the network increases  exponentially with the number of users that are connected to it) as the  cause.&nbsp; As significant, or more, are the&nbsp;number and&nbsp;types of  activities that&nbsp; become possible, or practical, only through an affordable  network of global scale, and free rights of participation.</p>
              <p class="style2">                I strongly doubt that the open source concept will be applied to  every area of endeavor, or that it will predominate in every area where it is  applied.&nbsp; But I also believe that we may be surprised at some of the areas  not yet imagined where it springs up next.</p>
              <p class="style2">                It will be interesting to track the spread of the open concept into  such new domains.&nbsp; Decades from now, researchers will certainly study this  era to puzzle out how and why what happened, in fact, happened.&nbsp; Why did  it spread to this&nbsp;new domain and not that,&nbsp;and why in that particular  order?&nbsp; What impact did new developments, such as the implementation of  the Semantic Web have?&nbsp; Did new developments merely accelerate the trend,  or did they enable the concept of &quot;open IPR&quot; to enter into areas that  would not otherwise have opted in, because the value proposition could not  shift in that area until better tools were available?</p>
              <p class="style2">                At the end of the day, is this really all so surprising?&nbsp;  Really, I think not.&nbsp; It just takes us longer to connect some dots than  others.</p>

An issue that remained in the background was whether the  United States should have to give up some of its control of the Internet, the  contentious issue from the WSIS that led in part to the forum&rsquo;s creation. <a href="http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=224&res=1024&print=0">...Full  Story</a></p>

                </a>Press Release</strong><br>
                <strong>BusinessWire.com March 15, 2006</strong>&nbsp;Haley Systems, Inc., a leading  provider of business rules management systems, today introduced the Business  Ontology eXchange, or BOX(TM), the industry's first online resource where  business analysts, knowledge workers, consultants, services partners and others  can share existing ontologies. By starting with an existing ontology as a  foundation, end users, systems integrators and independent software vendors can  greatly accelerate their time-to-market and reduce the cost of implementing a  business rules solution. The BOX will contain industry-specific ontologies,  such as insurance, as well as ontologies specific to horizontal applications  and business processes, such as regulatory compliance or Web site  personalization. The first ontology to be made available in the BOX will be one  for Property &amp; Casualty insurers, based on the ACORD XML standard. This  will be followed closely by an ontology for the MISMO standard for mortgage  insurance. <a href="http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/03/14/1457060.htm">...Full  Story</a></p>
