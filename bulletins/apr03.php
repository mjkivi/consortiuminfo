                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In this issue, we ask an important question: what attributes render a standard setting organization -- and its standards -- worthy of respect? The impetus for asking this question is a pending bill in Congress (H.R. 1086) which seeks to define, in effect, what a &quot;good&quot; standard setting organization is. (See the following article: <a href="#featured">&quot;H.R. 1086: Does Congress Know What it's Up To?&quot;</a>) </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A related question is, &quot;Who is entitled, and best qualified, to decide what those attributes are?&quot; Due to the vast purchasing power of the United States federal government and its myriad agencies, this question is more than usually relevant. Any decisions that the federal government makes about what standards it will endorse (or refuse to endorse) will have a profound impact on government contractors of many types. Another reason why the question is important is that the government has the power (as with H.R. 1086) to selectively shelter some types of standard setting over others from the full impact of antitrust and other laws.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill in question shines a spotlight yet again on the ongoing feud between the relatively small number of officially recognized Standards Development Organizations (such as ANSI) and their accredited standard setting partners (such as INCITS), and the more numerous types of unrecognized bodies, usually referred to generically as &quot;consortia.&quot; The formal bodies, or &quot;SDOs,&quot; typically have a more elaborate process than consortia and enjoy international recognition, while most consortia are more narrowly focused, more commercially driven, and place a premium on rapidity of process. Their standards often receive unofficial international &quot;de facto&quot; recognition due to their widespread adoption.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, the speed advantage of consortia has decreased, since many SDOs have adopted expedited processes in response to the competitive challenge represented by the burgeoning of consortia. At the same time, despite typically adopting a more streamlined process, not all consortia in fact achieve rapid results.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The distinction between the two types of organizations is further blurred by the fact that standards developed by consortia that achieve broad acceptance are often adopted by the SDOs themselves. As of this writing, almost every consortium that the author works with is in the process of transferring at least one standard to an SDO -- in most cases at the invitation of the SDO.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact of the matter is that both SDOs and consortia fulfill a vital function, as recognized by the fact that thousands of technology companies are active participants in multiple organizations of both types, at great expense in both cash and human resources.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, despite their non-profit status, standard setting organizations of both types often exhibit the same behaviors as their for-profit members: that is, they can become proprietary, turf conscious and competitive. Indeed, some standard setting organizations have been known to become almost as preoccupied with positioning themselves as their commercial counterparts, spending a significant portion of their management and board meeting time on issues related more closely to self-perpetuation than the direct goals of their members.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, it cannot be challenged that the modern technology-based world becomes daily more dependent upon standards. It is an ongoing thesis of this author that there is insufficient appreciation of what we call<em><strong> &quot;the global standard setting infrastructure.&quot;</strong></em> That is, the many hundreds of standard setting groups of every type -- from technical fora, to open source development networks, to consortia, to SDOs -- that agree upon commonalities of all types. These commonalities include not only traditional technical standards, but programming techniques, business methods, best practices, compliance tests and certification programs as well. Each of these still-evolving consensus-based processes play an essential role in the speedy development and adoption of new technology, and in the creation of useful products and services to the ultimate benefit of all sectors of the global economy.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us back to the danger of too-narrowly defining what a &quot;good&quot; standard setting organization is. We would submit that the following should be the ultimate definition of such an entity: </font></p>

                            <td><em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A &quot;good&quot; standard setting organization is a body which -- by whatever process it has adopted -- is successful in creating standards and other work product which are respected for their technical merit, trusted for their openness, and which become widely adopted. </strong></font> </em></td>
                          </tr>
                        </table>
                        <br>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To conclude that there is only one process that can achieve that end is to deny the contrary conclusion reached by a rigorous and dynamic marketplace. Certainly, developing best practices for standard setting and agreeing upon model intellectual property policies will make it easier to create and operate &quot;good&quot; standard setting bodies. But mandating a rigid approach will serve no one well.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We believe that it is time that the proponents of both SDOs and consortia lay down their cudgels and seek not only peaceful coexistence, but more outright cooperation as well. Each plays a vital role in the global standard setting infrastructure, and each is &quot;good&quot; in its own way. The anointment by Congress of one model over the other as the personification of &quot;goodness&quot; in standard setting will ultimately work to the detriment of vendors and end-users alike. </font></p>

A new bill under review in Congress (H.R. Bill 1086) would explicitly extend the protection of the NCRPA to standard setting, but only to SDOs and those few consortia, if any, that operate in a manner functionally equivalent to SDOs. The restrictive approach of H.R. 1086 in its current form represents a retreat from existing law as reflected in OMB Circular A-119 and would needlessly deprive those consortia which develop important standards from the protection which H.R. 1086 seeks to extend.

                              <em><strong><font size="3">Introduction</font></strong></em><font size="3">:</font> &nbsp;On March 5, H.R. Bill 1086 was introduced in Congress by James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R. - Wisc) and 16 other co-sponsors. Its stated purpose, as quoted above, recalls principles such as motherhood, America and apple pie. What could be wrong with a bill like this? Unfortunately, perhaps a great deal.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is a familiar axiom that &quot;no good deed goes unpunished.&quot; Thus it is that Congress should first be applauded for making one of its very rare forays into promoting and facilitating the standard setting process. And there is an actual need for the bill, which is intended to correct a flaw in the law which it seeks to amend. That law -- now called the National Cooperative Research and Production Act (NCRPA) -- was drafted to benefit cooperative efforts that commenced after the bill was passed, leaving then-operating consortia and SDOs ineligible. H.R. Bill 1086 would amend the NCRPA to offer a grace period under which these preexisting organizations could register themselves under the Act.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the structure of the bill itself is seriously (and perhaps unintentionally) flawed, and could serve to restrict, rather than augment, the speed and range of standard setting. The reason is that, while H.R. Bill provides that it will not &quot;alter or modify the antitrust treatment under existing law&quot; of standard setting, it leaves open which standard setting activities, if any, of entities that do not meet the Bills' definition of a &quot;good&quot; standard setting organization are entitled to protection. Indeed, the inference would seem to be that non-SDO organizations are ineligible for protection.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The current language of the Bill is doubly unfortunate because there is no public interest to be served by adopting so restrictive an approach. Indeed, there is the prospect of harm, as its effect may be to lead those who would set standards to choose venues for their efforts that may be less appropriate and/or rapid in a given case. This is ironic, since the original purpose of the NCRPA was to make America more competitive in world markets by allowing commercial companies to work together cooperatively and on an expedited basis. Indeed, when first enacted, the NCRPA was intended to encourage not broad-based consensus organizations, but close cooperation by major corporations in areas such as semiconductor design.</font></p>

The intent of the Circular over the years has been to discourage the government's reliance on government-unique standards and to encourage agencies to instead rely on voluntary consensus standards. It is has not been the intent of the Circular to create the basis for discrimination among standards developed in the private sector, whether consensus-based or, alternatively, industry-based or company-based. Accordingly, we added language to clarify this point.

                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>(A) Notice: </em></strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What constitutes sufficient notice? Many consortia have very limited financial resources, and are unable to give broad distribution of information, beyond their websites. While publication by a well known SDO with decades of history at its website may constitute appropriate notice, what would be the duty of a small consortium developing a narrow niche standard, with no staff, a budget of a few tens of thousands of dollars, and which receives little notice in the technical press?</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>(B) Opportunity to Participate:</em></strong></font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone has to pay the bills for standard setting, test suite development, certification and promotion. Some consortia have memberships of fewer than a hundred companies, but budgets in excess of $1 million. Indeed, some consortia also provide for a public comment period. But the ultimate vote to accept a final specification is limited to those members that have paid for the privilege of doing so. How does one prevent economic &quot;free ridership&quot; if anyone can participate for a nominal, or no cost? If free ridership is possible, who would be willing to pay the higher fees necessary to support the organization? Note also that a standard which is viewed as being proprietary is unlikely to be widely adopted, and hence even a limited field of participants is aware that its work product must meet the needs and approval of a broad commercial audience. As a result, the consortium-based process has its own commercial checks and balances.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>(C) Balancing of Interests:</em></strong></font><em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Which interests? And how is a consortium to persuade those interests to participate? If a consortium were to set distance learning standards (as some of our clients do), how would they ensure that all interests relevant to the standard were heard, and still finish a standard within budget, and on time? Would the participation of K-12 administrators and teachers be mandatory?</font></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>(D) Readily Available Access to Proposed Standards:</em></strong></font><em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One valuable right of membership in a consortium is the right to receive advance access to standards in the process of development. Absent this benefit, there is again less incentive for commercial enterprises to fund standards development activities. Indeed, even some organizations that regard themselves as SDOs, or which are accredited by SDOs, operate at times under confidentiality restrictions.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>(E) Substantial Agreement on all Material Points:</em></strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If the alternatives are (i) no standard at all, (ii) an ineffective (but consensus based) standard, or (iii) an effective standard supported by a majority of process members and later adopted almost universally, which is better for the end-user? In fact, the process of standard setting is often quite contentious, and perhaps even beneficially so. Especially where existing instantiations of a new standard are a requirement for submission (in order to enable rapid market implementation of adopted standards) there are likely to be winners as well as losers, and it is unlikely and unrealistic to expect a vendor and its allies to vote in favor of a competitor's submission.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="3"><em>(F) The Right to Voice a Position, Have it Considered, and Appeal a Decision: </em></font></strong><font size="3"><em></em></font><font size="2">Consortia follow the first two precepts (with respect to the paid membership), but few, if any, provide for the final -- and arguably superfluous -- appeals step. If the first two steps have been followed in proper fashion, there should be no need for a final appeal. In fact, many consortia provide that a technical committee vote to adopt a standard must be approved by the Board of Directors. Part of the reason is to permit the Board to consider any contentions that the adoption process has been flawed.</font></font></p>

Indeed, some SDOs might not meet one or more of the principles! </font>
                                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Crucially important consortia, such as the W3C, might be ineligible to seek protection under the NCRPA, as amended by H.R. 1086. Given the strategic importance of the World Wide Web, it is vital that an organization such as this, as well as its many members, can conduct its activities with the greatest degree of immunity from both strategic, competitive lawsuits as well as innocent mistakes.- As shown by the experience with the GIRM model submission, government agencies are already confused by their duties as respects standards. Due to the many references to OMB A-119 in H.R. 1086, and the ingrafting of several OMB A-119 definitions into the NCRPA itself, these principles may be seen as an additional indication that only SDO-developed standards may be specified by government agencies.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- The consortium movement was founded for the very purpose of avoiding the constraints of some of these same principles. In short, if strict adherence to these principles had been viewed by commercial enterprises to be tolerable, consortia would never have come into existence.</font></p>

The current effort in Congress is proceeding with very little publicity or input from the industry, and perhaps none to date from the myriad consortia that set standards. If Congress is to be allowed to determine what a &quot;good&quot; standard setting organization is, it should be advised by far more extensive and diverse testimony than it has received to date. Its time for the progress of H.R. Bill 1086 to pause so that interested parties can be made aware of what is intended. More voices must be given the opportunity to advise Congress on the necessity of enacting a broader bill that will truly serve the best interests of government, industry, and end-users alike.</font></p>

Those SDOs that have served their niches well have grown and become more influential, sometimes becoming the hubs of activities involving many SDOs.

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the same forty-two years, INCITS was evolving its role in the global standards infrastructure, adapting as the world of standards development itself evolved. Today, besides acting as an SDO in its own right (it has been accredited by ANSI since its inception), it plays an important role in both further developing consortium-originated standards, as well as introducing those standards into acceptance by ISO/IEC. Most recently, it has assumed a role at the center of the major IT SDOs.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Taking a closer look at the more recent evolution of INCITS also provides one way to better understand important factors in the evolution of the entire global standards infrastructure -- such as the way in which SDOs interrelate, and the way that consortia and SDOs are finding to productively work together.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>INCITS Today:</em></strong></font><em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The latest transformation of INCITS is indeed recent: INCITS entered 2003 with a stronger link to ISO/IEC, and acquired responsibility for the Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC1) Technical Advisory Group (TAG), which had formerly been a separate organization with SDOs, vendors and users as members. Other ANSI-accredited standards organizations integral to the &quot;new&quot; INCITS in its JTC1 TAG role are the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA - itself an alliance of six major standards bodies), and the Uniform Code Council (UCC). The collective standards output of this grouping -- which includes EIA's Home Electronic Systems (HES) HomeGate, IEEE's 802.11 family of wireless standards, and the UCC's barcode-related standards -- accounts for nearly all of the SDO-based IT standardization work in the world. The only international IT standards that top INCITS-related standards in sales are the ISO 9000 series of quality standards.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, INCITS finds itself in the middle of a great deal of standards setting activity involving diverse organizations. The following diagram seeks to represent INCITS in the context of the formal standards bodies:</font></p>
                        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/bulletins/incits.jpg" width="465" height="305"></font></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font size="3">A Bridge Over Troubled Waters:</font></strong></em> But while INCITS was busy with its own activities in the closing fifteen years of the last century, another method of standard setting was becoming pervasive in the market place. Unlike other areas of standard setting (such as health and safety), the need for IT standards is often urgent, and the jockeying of individual companies is frequently intense. Partly as a result of these forces and because few IT standards are subject to regulation, many companies began banding together in the late 1980s to create interoperability and other standards using a more informal process. The resulting organizations became known as &quot;consortia,&quot; and over time this method became increasingly popular with companies that a few years before would have automatically brought their standard setting proposals to an SDO.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With time, it has become increasingly accepted that the marketplace should seek to take advantage of the best of both the SDO as well as the consortium methodologies. Today, both consortia and SDOs are more frequently opting to cooperate. The reasons vary, depending upon the type of organization.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For a consortium, a number of reasons may lead it to consider partnering with an SDO at some point in its life cycle. One is that SDOs -- by design -- tend to be very broad and comprehensive in their scope. In contrast, consortia often have a narrower focus, and are sometimes formed to create a single standard. Due to the breadth of interest of SDOs, there is usually an appropriate and potentially interested SDO available if a consortium wishes to work with one. The consortium's reason for doing so may be that its development work is done, and it does not wish to continue in existence for purely maintenance purposes, or that the financial commitment of its members is waning, or because it desires to achieve ISO/IEC acceptance for its standard.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, the proliferation of consortia has provided a level of competition that was unknown to SDOs before the late 1980s. Maryann Karinch, communications advisor to INCITS, identifies attracting new work as one of the greatest challenges facing INCITS today. That challenge arises, she says, &quot;because many IT producers would prefer the venues where they have the greatest influence over projects and members.&quot; In short -- consortia, with their relative flexibility of operation, as compared to SDOs, with their more established and mandatory process and policies.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How should an SDO react to the launch of consortium efforts in the same general technical space as one of its existing technical committees? Commencing a work group to solve the same problem would rarely serve anyone well. At best, confusion and inefficient usage of resources will result. At worst, overlapping standards efforts can result in duplicative and divisive standards. Often, it simply makes more sense for both sides if a standard originates in one system, and is later transferred into the other.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Karinch, INCITS has taken the prevalence of consortia into account in creating its strategic vision, noting: &quot;As an SDO, INCITS [has] committed to an expanded program of work, which allows for more productive collaboration with consortia.&quot; She believes that INCITS is affected both positively and negatively by the competitive shifts among consortia. On the positive side, some consortia have found ways to team up with INCITS to further develop their specifications and fast track them to ISO/IEC -- often with the encouragement of major IT companies which are often on the Boards of both organizations.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the negative side, she notes that some of the projects that would fit within the purview of existing INCITS Technical Committees end up being permanently addressed by consortia, sometimes resulting in redundant efforts.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent collaborations between INCITS and consortia include successful efforts with the SQL/XML Group and the BioAPI Consortium. While the former worked well as an independent effort for two years, its members eventually opted to trade out of their informal mode of operation. As a result, representatives from member companies asked INCITS' H2 to establish a new Task Group so that future proposals linked to the SQL/XML specification could be developed within the de jure standards environment.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Similarly, when INCITS&#8217; M1 took on the BioAPI spec for fast tracking, Cathy Tilton of SAFLINK, who chairs the BioAPI Consortium, stated: &#8220;It has always been one of the [BioAPI] Consortium&#8217;s goals to eventually transition the BioAPI to a formal standards body. INCITS provides a great vehicle for doing just that; and we feel that with the release of Version 1.1 of the specification, it is the right time to move forward with that goal.&#8221;</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once adopted for its fast track process, a consortium-originated standard can become approved by ANSI with INCITS' help in as little as four to six months. Moreover, participation can be broadened once INCITS steps in, since voting membership in the process is only $800. INCITS has also tried to make itself more competitive with consortia. For example, it) annually revisits processes with its Technical Committee (TC) chairs at a TC Symposium. This has resulted in streamlining standards reviews and approvals. INCITS has also worked to create a more direct relationship with ISO/IEC, so that it can make it easier and faster for standards promoted by it to be accepted internationally. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>Life as an SDO in a Changing World:</strong></em></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> INCITS has had to react to member expectations, as well as competition from consortia. Karinch summarizes the situation as follows: &quot;Customers recognize the value of interoperable equipment and are insisting on it. Producers have streaked past many user expectations with innovations, and now need to write specs to encourage market acceptance of them. INCITS has had to evolve -- in a substantive way -- to remain distinct among the complementary (as well as competitive and redundant) standards groups trying to meet the needs of both savvy customers and inventive vendors. Every INCITS Executive Board agenda has action items that drive to that end; at the same time, INCITS centers itself with its time-tested procedures.&quot;</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are other pressures as well. INCITS reports that it is feeling the increasing pressure from the European SDOs which are stepping up pressure within international bodies to adopt standards originated through their regional processes. While most IT SDOs in the US include many member companies that are global in operations, INCITS believes that it remains important to its members to assert a US position, in order to ensure the competitiveness of US headquartered business in overseas markets. INCITS&#8217; expanded role internationally and its efforts to strengthen its links to ISO/IEC are intended in significant measure to accomplish this goal. INCITS believes that these efforts have been effective: Karinch reports that INCITS was instrumental in ensuring that the two latest secretariats in JTC 1 are US led (SC 36 &#8211; Learning, Education and Training, and SC 37 &#8211; Biometrics). </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong></font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While consortia have provided competition to INCITS in the last 15 years, INCITS has stayed a vital, and indeed increasingly influential, player in the global IT standards infrastructure. With the increasing popularity of the Open Source methodology, consortia as well as SDOs will need to adapt, and doubtless in the future additional ways will evolve to help companies bring sophisticated, interoperable products to end users. To its credit, INCITS has reacted to changing times by providing a process where they can work with consortia, rather than present the marketplace with a pure &quot;us or them&quot; value proposition.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, INCITS hardly intends to concede the standard setting field to consortia. It believes that it continues to provide an excellent, and increasingly streamlined, venue for standards efforts to be launched in the first instance. As differentiators, it is quick to note its low costs of participation for interested companies, its established process and its ability to progress a standard to international status. All of which, it believes, make it as appropriate a venue for the creation of the next wave of IT standards as it has been for the innovations of the last 42 years.</font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Regular readers of the Consortium Standards Bulletin are aware that we have been following the case of <em><strong>Rambus v. Infineon</strong></em> and its potentially significant impact on standards organizations and their technical processes (<a href="/bulletins/mar03.php#rambus">Rambus Update: It May Not Be Over Yet</a>, March 2003; <a href="/bulletins/feb03.php#editorial">Rambus - Hard Cases Make Bad Law</a>, February 2003). The case and all of its final implications for anti-trust and intellectual property issues will not be known until the last decision is handed down. Since our last issue, the date that this will happen has been postponed, as a result of Infineon's filing a motion, granted by the Appeals Court on April 11. That motion will freeze the effectiveness of the Appeals Court decision while Infineon seeks to have the Supreme Court grant &quot;certiorari,&quot; i.e., to consider one or more aspects of the case.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, the more immediate concern for Rambus begins <strong>today</strong> as the Federal Trade Commission brings its own investigation against Rambus to trial. This part of the Rambus saga began in June of 2002, when the FTC charged Rambus with federal antitrust violations and deliberate and deceptive anti-competitive practices regarding its intellectual property rights. The FTC asserts that Rambus' actions would have direct and indirect impacts adversely affecting standard setting organizations and activities. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the FTC's case, like the Infineon case, involves Rambus' participation in JEDEC's SDRAM standard setting work and its non-disclosure of relevant patent rights, the charges and laws involved in each case are distinct; possibly distinct enough to allow for a very different outcome for Rambus. For example, in <em>Rambus v. Infineon</em>, which was tried under Virginia state law, Infineon was required to support its claims based on a &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; standard of proof. The FTC, by comparison, bases its claims on alleged violations under federal antitrust law. Under this body of law, the government will be required to prove its case under the less stringent &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; test. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, the burden of proof in regard to evidence in the FTC trial today will rest more heavily on Rambus than in the Infineon case as a result of determinations already made by the administrative judge presiding over the suit. Earlier this year, the FTC requested a default judgment against Rambus, claiming that the company had destroyed evidence related to the investigation and that it should therefore forfeit its right to trial. On March 5, 2003, administrative law judge James Timony denied the FTC's request, but agreed that Rambus had indeed destroyed or failed to preserve required evidence and therefore will have the burden of proving its innocence on certain points during the trial that begins today. In his statement, the judge wrote, &quot;...it is clear that Rambus should not be rewarded for its gross negligence concerning, or reckless disregard of, its obligation to maintain documents potentially relevant to litigation and (to) inventory those documents destroyed.&quot; In other words, on some key points the Judge has already held that Rambus is &quot;guilty until proven innocent.&quot;</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The outcome of the FTC investigation will have widespread consequences monetarily for the organizations involved. Should the FTC prevail in its antitrust claims, Rambus would be forced to forfeit the right to receive what may potentially be as much as a billion dollars in license and patent-infringement fees. The stakes for standard setting organizations are also high. If Rambus is convicted, some measure of trust will be restored to the standard setting process. If Rambus is successful in defeating the FTC as well as Infineon, the reverberations will be far-reaching indeed. </font></p>
