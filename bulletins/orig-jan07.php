                  <p align="left" class="style2">Last issue, I wrote about the business issues that must be  addressed in order to create a successful consortium, and promised to return to  the topic of consortium formation the topic next time around.&nbsp; In this issue, I'll focus on two topics: the  role of the director in guiding a consortium, and the legal considerations that  must be addressed in creating and operating a successful consortium.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong> this month, I highlight the fact  that the success criteria for a non-profit standard setting or promotional  consortium can be very different than those that indicate victory for a profit-driven  business.&nbsp; After all, consortia are  founded to drive the adoption of standards, and not membership revenue.&nbsp; As a result, directors must trade in one set  of assumptions when they leave their desks at their day jobs and are called  upon to guide a consortium.&nbsp; If they  fail to do so, the means can become the end.&nbsp;  When this happens, members can end up with an organization more focused  on growth and perpetuation than standards and adoption.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Directors of non-profit consortia must also recall that they are  subject to the same duties of loyalty as for-profit corporate directors, even  if their employers have the right to appoint them in exchange for large dues  payments.&nbsp; As a result, the director  role can become particularly complex for vendor representatives: while they may  be expected to present the viewpoint of their employers as representatives to  illustrate the needs of other members with similar interests, they must still  act on behalf of all members, and not just their employers.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Feature</em></strong> article, I provide a detailed overview  of legal matters of concern to consortia at the time of formation &ndash; covering  topics as diverse as jurisdictions of incorporation, antitrust law, tax  exemptions, trademarks, intellectual property rights policies, and more.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">For January's <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection, I focus on  the other end of the funnel &ndash; and provide an update on a specification that  I've been writing about directly and indirectly since the late summer of 2004 &ndash;  Microsoft's Office Open XML formats (OOXML), which are now under review in  ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1.&nbsp;  That specification was approved by European standards body Ecma last  December.&nbsp; Unlike most standards, OOXML  is intended to describe a single product &ndash; Microsoft Office.&nbsp; The next six months will tell whether this  type of standards effort is, or is not, destined to be successful.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> essay, I examine the parlous  practice of developing standards contemporaneously with the evolution of the  underlying technology &ndash; a risky business that is bound to result in many  standards failing, but nonetheless enables those that are successful to permit  products to reach and proliferate in the marketplace far more quickly than if  the standards process were to follow rather than lead.</p>

              <p align="left" class="style2">Becoming a productive director in a standard setting organization  (SSO) can be a disorienting experience, especially if the responsibilities of  that office are fully embraced.&nbsp; The  reason is that while the same legal duties apply to an SSO director as control  the actions of other corporate directors, many traditional management goals are  turned inside out.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">At the most basic level, a director of an SSO must shed the  conviction that the most important goals of the enterprise are to drive growth,  maximize profits and ensure institutional survival, and drive growth.&nbsp; In fact, those goals may or may not be  consistent with the actual mission of an SSO at all.&nbsp; This is particularly so for an SSO with a discrete goal, such as  developing and promoting a single standard, as compared to an organization with  a mandate to develop multiple standards to serve the core needs of an entire  technical domain.&nbsp; In the former case,  success may be measured by declaring &quot;mission accomplished,&quot; handing  off the standard to another SSO for long-term maintenance, and promptly going  out of business.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Too often, SSO directors with the best of intentions focus  primarily on traditional metrics, quizzing management more on membership growth  and numbers of press releases issued, rather than on numbers of standards  completed and (more importantly) broadly adopted.&nbsp; Over time, the culture of such an organization can turn to one of  self-preservation, rather than achievement of its true mission.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Directors of SSOs that are nominated by vendors can find  themselves in another, and more awkward position.&nbsp; The conflict arises from the fact that they are expected to wear  two hats, and often have a third in their back pocket as well.&nbsp; The first chapeau is the conservative  homburg of a director in a traditional corporation, which obligates its wearer  to observe a duty of loyalty to all owners of the organization.&nbsp; The second hat is less conservative, and its  style is intended to be representative of the member and its peer  companies.&nbsp; This is because directors on  the boards of many SSOs are expected to express the viewpoint of their  employers (large and small, hardware and software, vendor or end-user), thereby  acting as a proxy for similarly situated members with similar interests and needs.&nbsp; This is particularly so in SSOs (which,  after all, are membership organizations) that try to balance their boards in  order to ensure that all categories of members are heard, and their needs  accommodated.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The virtual ball cap in the back pocket, of course, prominently  bears the corporate logo of the director's employer, and it is this headgear  that creates the tension.&nbsp; The reality  in many consortia is that those that pay the most get the most influence &ndash;  which often means a guaranteed board seat.&nbsp;  Sometimes the price can be quite high.&nbsp;  How are the expectations of members that pay such prices to be squared  with the legal duties of a director?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The statutory answer is clear &ndash; a director's duties trump her  employer's directives.&nbsp; In the breach,  of course, what actually goes through the mind of an individual director when a  question is put to a vote is known to that individual alone.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In fact, this type of internal struggle need not be as it may  first appear.&nbsp; An apt analogy can be  found at the technical level, where  newcomers to the standards world must come to grips with the reality that  success in standard setting is about giving away rights in some technology in  order to make money on other technology.&nbsp;  This means that those who would form a new consortium must enter into a  sort of &quot;through the looking glass&quot; world where patents are  impediments rather than tools, royalties represent unwanted encumbrances,  licenses exist for the sake of disclaiming rights, and collaborating with  competitors is as essential as working with partners.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In  the technology sector, more and more vendors &quot;get&quot; this concept,  resulting in increasing pressure to develop standards that are not only royalty  free, but in the case of software, available on terms that are conducive to open  source implementation as well.&nbsp; One  reason is that we live in an increasingly networked world.&nbsp; In such a place, the biggest wins come from  enabling the creation of markets for new products and services that would not  be viable absent agreement on enabling standards, and not from the royalties  that might be obtained from a single patent, perhaps at the cost of  constraining the size of the market itself.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">This  is the goal on which a director must focus, and not the particular technical  outcome that might be somewhat more desirable for her employer, if only the  opposition can be maneuvered into the right positions to win the play.&nbsp; </p>
              <div align="left" class="style2">At  the end of the day, the very serious game of standard setting must be played on  the other side of the looking glass, and by its own rules.&nbsp; Under those rules, winning must be a team  effort &ndash; with everyone wearing the same hat. </div>

              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Introduction: </em></strong>In the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov06.php#feature">first  installment</a> of this two-part article, I focused on the business issues and  concepts underlying the formation of a successful consortium to develop and/or promote standards. <a href="#1">1</a> In  this second and final installment, I will discuss the legal issues that relate  to the creation and operation of such organizations. <a href="#2">2</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">Standard setting organizations (SSOs), whether  they be decades-old accredited standards development organizations (SDOs), or  any of the more recently formed non-accredited organizations that range from  small, invitation-only entities to well-respected, global standard setting  consortia such as the W3C, IETF or OASIS, face essentially the same legal issues. <a href="#3">3</a> These issues morph over time, as new laws are  passed, new cases reinterpret old laws and decisions, and SSOs enter into new  areas of endeavor.&nbsp; For SSOs, as with  other businesses, staying on the right side of existing and new legal rules  requires ongoing awareness and monitoring. <a href="#4">4</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">But while the same legal issues are relevant to  almost all SSOs, the specific ways in which a given SSO will operate and  structure itself in relation to those issues will necessarily be a product of  its particular situation: its mission, goals, projected membership and  activities, and other variables.&nbsp; In  this article, I will review the areas of legal significance with which the  founders of a new SSO must be aware, and highlight the types of decisions that  such founders should make, based upon their unique business plan.&nbsp; The issues addressed, and the solutions  suggested, are based upon my experience in helping create more than 50  consortia over the past 18 years.&nbsp; A full list of the SSOs that I have  represented can be found at this <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/practice_areas/consortium.php#CLIENTLIST">Web page</a>. </p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structure</strong> </p>
              <p class="style2"><br>
                <span class="style10"><strong><em>Concerns to be addressed:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span>Standard setting and related activities (e.g., promotion, test-creation and certification testing, public advocacy and training) present a range of concerns that dictate structural decisions.  These concerns include the following:</p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Liability:</span></em></strong><span class="style10">&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">While SSOs do not typically engage in high-risk activities, SSO members (and especially corporate members) have an understandable aversion to participating in organizations where the actions or inactions of other members could lead to joint liability.  Accordingly, mechanisms intended to eliminate, or at least limit, such an eventuality are essential to facilitating successful recruitment.</span></p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Practicalities:</span></em></strong>&nbsp; SSOs that are more than minimally active will soon face the need to enter into contracts with third parties such as trade show management companies, public relations firms, and Web hosting services.  They may also wish to hire employees.  Absent an incorporated entity to sign legally binding agreements, one member or another will need to provide a signature – and incur the front-line liability on the obligation.  Even something as simple as opening a bank account becomes problematic.  </a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Ownership of intellectual property:</em></strong>&nbsp; SSOs create assets of various types in which  intellectual property rights (IPR), typically copyrights, trademarks and  potentially patentable inventions, will exist.&nbsp;  But who should own, and define the limits of, those rights?&nbsp; On the one hand, individual members do not  wish their own ownership rights to be jeopardized when they collaborate in a  working group?&nbsp; But on the other,  potential implementers will need to be convinced that implementing the  resulting specification will not result in potential liability for  infringement, or in becoming unduly dependent on the intentions of a single  patent owner &ndash; especially if that patent owner is a competitor.&nbsp; As a result, the ownership of assets such as  standards, test suites and trademarks is a matter of particular concern, as are  the legal mechanisms by which desired outcomes may be guaranteed.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style10"><strong><em>Governance:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> Whatever structure is chosen must not only be appropriate to  permit efficient and effective operations, but also satisfy the concerns of  those that are investing in the creation of the new entity: that it will not  stray from its intended purpose, that it will be perceived as &quot;open&quot;  (if that is the goal) or permit the founders to remain in control (if openness  is not a concern), that no individual member can block or veto necessary  actions, and so on.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style10"><strong><em>Ease and cost of formation:</em></strong>&nbsp; </span>Time spent on formation and dollars spent on  lawyers do not advance the goals for which a new organization is formed.&nbsp; Accordingly, the structure chosen should  permit as rapid and inexpensive a launch as possible, as well as efficiency in  ongoing operation.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Formation criteria:</em></strong>&nbsp;  Deciding which structure is most appropriate for a new organization will  be most heavily influenced by the answers to the following questions, among  others:</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style10"><strong><em>Duration:</em></strong></span>&nbsp;  What is the expected duration of the project at hand?&nbsp; Will it be finite, and limited (for example)  to the development of a single specification, which will then be offered to  another SSO for adoption and long-term maintenance, or will the new  organization be founded to create an ongoing series of standards?&nbsp; If the former, the business plan may be less  complex, and the needed legal structure more light weight.&nbsp; In the latter, multiple classes of  membership, layers of technical process, and a variety of promotional and other  activities may be involved, requiring a more robust and detailed governance and  operational structure to be enabled and managed through the legal  structure.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10"></span></em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Membership:</em></strong>&nbsp; Will the success of the initiative be assured by the  participation of a small number of participants, or only by attracting the  involvement of a large and diverse membership?&nbsp;  Will the value propositions required to attract different types of  stakeholders vary greatly?&nbsp; Will any  type of stakeholder (e.g., government representatives) be subject to legal  constraints on its activities, or that would limit its ability to make the  commitments required of a member?</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10"></span></em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Activities:</em></strong>&nbsp; What might the new organization wish to do over its expected  lifespan?&nbsp; Only develop or promote  standards, or also create test suites and conduct compliance testing?&nbsp; Will it wish to support a branding  program?&nbsp; Will it need to have  international operations and offices?&nbsp;  Will it engage in lobbying or other public advocacy activities?&nbsp; Will it generate revenue from other than  membership fees?&nbsp; Will it wish to limit  its activities only to members, or permit participation by others in some of  its activities as well?&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10"></span></em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Liability profile:</em></strong>&nbsp; Most standards-related activities are quite  benign, but this is not true in all cases, and even in benign cases, where the  membership constitutes &quot;market power&quot; under the antitrust laws (e.g.,  a significant percentage of the competitors in a given product or service space  are members), the potential for inadvertent mistakes, as well as the level of  potential scrutiny by government regulators, is higher.&nbsp; In such a situation, individual members may  wish to maintain tighter control over what can &ndash; and more importantly, what  cannot &ndash; be done by the organization and its members without proper prior  consideration.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Available structures:</em></strong>&nbsp;  While there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; way to structure and  manage a consortium, there are reasonably defined variations and best practices  to consider before creating one.&nbsp; As a  result, a small number of models have evolved upon which nearly all SSOs are  founded.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States (where  the great majority of new SSOs have been formed in the last twenty years), new  consortia are almost always based upon one of three legal foundations, each of  which has its advantages and disadvantages, requiring detailed explanation.&nbsp; They are as follows:</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="style10"><strong><em>The &quot;classic&quot; corporate model</em></strong>:</span>&nbsp; By far and away, the largest number of  consortia intended to have more than a transitory existence are structured as  corporations.&nbsp; Typically, they are  formed under the not for profit laws of a jurisdiction, whether or not the  founders intend to seek federal or state tax exemption for the consortium.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                The  would-be founders of a consortium very frequently believe that a corporation is  the last, rather than the first, alternative to consider.&nbsp; The reason is that a corporation would seem  to represent expense, complexity, permanence and burden.&nbsp; In fact, the opposite is almost always the  case, due to the simple fact that existing corporate law supplies all of the  rules, as well as the solutions, that a non-corporate structure must otherwise  create from whole cloth.&nbsp; Moreover,  there are some concerns, such as joint liability, which cannot be easily or  completely avoided by any non-incorporated means &ndash; yet the simplest corporate structure,  if properly maintained, can provide convincing protection to its officers,  directors and members.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Moreover,  experienced counsel should already possess a set of model documents that can be  easily tailored to the needs of the organization, and which provide all of the  statutorily-enforceable rules and provisions other than those which will be  unique to the organization.&nbsp; Those  documents include the following:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2"><strong>Certificate of Incorporation</strong>, containing the       limited number of rights and rules which by law must be set forth in this       public document rather than in the organization's Bylaws (which need not       be filed with the State). </li>
                <li class="style2"><strong>Detailed Bylaws</strong>, which       contain the legal and procedural rules of operation, the governance       structure, the classes of membership and their rights, and other       provisions which enable the day by day operation of the organization       (other than the technical process, on which more below).</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong>Membership Application</strong>,  which should be drafted to constitute a legally binding contract between a  member and the consortium, and thereby obligating the applicant to the rules of  the organization, including its IPR Policy.<a href="#6">6</a> </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Upon formation of a  membership corporation, all of the initial concerns have been satisfied: a  liability shield has been created, an entity exists that can create and own  IPR, sign contracts, and employ staff (if desired), and a workable governance  structure has been provided within a reliably enforceable statutory  context.&nbsp; Moreover, if the documents  used are already familiar to the members by reason of membership in other consortia  built upon the same models, legal review by members will be far faster than  would be the case if a custom, non-incorporated model were to be employed.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Limited Liability  Corporations:</span></em></strong>&nbsp; A small number of consortia  have been created based upon this model.&nbsp;  Limited liability corporations (usually referred to simply as  &quot;LLCs&quot;) came into being comparatively recently, but may now be  created in every US state, the rules of varying to some extent among jurisdictions.&nbsp; LLCs provide essentially all of the same legal  protections and capabilities as the traditional corporation, but under  generally more flexible rules.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                This flexibility provides a  mixed blessing.&nbsp; On the one hand, the  members of an LLC may &quot;opt out&quot; of certain unavoidable constraints to  which all corporations are subject.&nbsp; But  on the other, this same flexibility leads to the need to provide for more  detailed and customized documentation.&nbsp;  And, since much more language is now custom, rather than closely  derivative of statute, there is less certainty as to how a court would construe  and enforce that language in the case of a dispute.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Another result of this  customization and lessened certainty of result is that members are more likely  to conclude that the close attention of their own counsel must be directed at  the formation documents, which can lead to dramatically higher formation costs  and a delayed launch date for the new organization.</p>
              <p class="style2">As a result, and as  is the case in many commercial settings, an LLC structure is usually used to  form a consortium only when the simpler, traditional corporate structure will  not permit some important objective to be satisfied. <a href="#7">7</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Non-incorporated models:</span></em></strong><span class="style10">&nbsp; </span>By definition, non-incorporated models are more diverse, due to  the fact that founders that choose this route are working from a clean  slate.&nbsp; That said, non-incorporated  initiatives may initially be divided into two groups: the &quot;muddle  along&quot; and the documented.&nbsp; Muddle  along initiatives, not surprisingly, are generally modest, and may be  promotional, educational or otherwise more limited in ambitions than more  determined standards development efforts.&nbsp;  If the initiative proves to be worthwhile and ongoing, a non-documented  effort will usually become incorporated or otherwise documented eventually &ndash;  often when the in-house counsel of one or more members becomes aware of what is  going on.</p>
              <p class="style2"> Where the decision is made  to pay due attention to legal concerns but not incorporate, some sort of  legally binding documentation must be created.&nbsp;  As with LLCs, this means that more effort must be dedicated to spelling  out all aspects of the organization's governance, membership, operations,  duration, ownership rights, and other details than would be required if the  founders had desired to incorporate.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Notwithstanding a number of  shortcomings (discussed below) of the non-incorporated model, this approach is  still common, especially in situations where a limited number of companies  wishes to create a specification that may infringe upon patents owned by each  founding member.&nbsp; In short, the goal of  the founders may be to simply add rules relating to joint development  activities to a typical cross-license agreement.&nbsp; In this model, a &quot;promoter adopter&quot; structure is often  utilized, in which the core members (usually a group formed by invitation only)  enter into a &quot;promoter agreement,&quot; under which the promoters agree to  use a specification contributed by one or more members, or to jointly create a  specification needed by all to (for example) create a new product that requires  interoperability among all vendor offerings.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Under the terms of the  promoter agreement, each promoter typically provides the group with a  royalty-free cross license under all of its necessary patent claims under the  specifications created by the organization.&nbsp;  The promoter agreement also permits each promoter to sublicense the  right to implement the same specification, subject to the patent rights of each  promoter.&nbsp; All promoters typically agree  to make patent licenses available to all such sublicensees under reasonable and  non-discriminatory (RAND) terms.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                The right to implement the  specification is provided to third parties under an &quot;adopter  agreement,&quot; using a mutually agreed upon form.&nbsp; Adopters may still need to approach the other promoters directly  to enter into patent license agreements with each other promoter.&nbsp; The terms of these licenses may sometimes be  more restrictive than might commonly be found in relation to standards that are  developed by consortia based upon more open models. </p>
              <p class="style2">                The promoter-adopter model  is popular with a few companies with very large patent portfolios, and is most  often found in the market niches occupied by these companies.&nbsp; Its advantages include the following:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">A high degree of       certainty regarding patent rights among promoters and adopters (adopters       are usually asked to provide a license to their own necessary claims under       the specification back to the promoters, or may at least lose their       license if they sue any promoter for infringement)</li>
                <li class="style2">A light-weight       document structure, since the promoter agreement typically provides for       all obligations (formation, governance and IPR related) in a single       agreement, and the shorter adopter agreement provides all that an adopter       needs, other than any direct licenses required by one or more promoters</li>
                <li class="style2">A reasonably       standardized document package, due in part to the fact that a large       percentage of the organizations based upon this model have been created by       a small number of companies. </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">The disadvantages of the  promoter-adopter model (and all other non-incorporated approaches) are equally  significant.&nbsp; They include the  following:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">There is less certainty of legal enforceability       in general in comparison to the corporate model, since terms must       primarily be legally interpreted on their own merit, rather than in the       context of a legislatively provided statutory context, supported by       voluminous case law.</li>
                <li class="style2">Where certainty of result does exist, it is not       always welcome.&nbsp; For example,       regardless of any language that is included in the operative agreement       among the members of an unincorporated consortium, applicable law may deem       the arrangement to be equivalent to a partnership, subjecting all members       to joint liability not only with respect to the debts or actions of the       organization itself, but potentially for the acts or omissions of any       single member when that member is arguably acting on behalf of the       organization.&nbsp; </li>
                <li class="style2">Third parties may be unwilling to accept a       signature on behalf of an unincorporated entity.&nbsp; Nor can such an organization easily hire employees.&nbsp; </li>
                <li class="style2">Each member's balance sheet would need to carry       its allocable share of the profits and losses of the organization.</li>
                <li class="style2">If membership is by invitation only, the       specifications that are created are inherently more proprietary and less       open, at least by appearance, and often in practice.</li>
                <li class="style2">If more than a single class of membership is       needed, the documentation becomes more complex.</li>
              </ul>
              <span class="style2">For these and other reasons, non-incorporated  models are less often used than corporate models.&nbsp; When they are, it is often due to one of the following reasons:  the founders are only familiar with the unincorporated model; they wrongly  believe that forming a corporation would be more expensive and complicated; or  the goals of the founders are limited, as when the intention is to create and  maintain a single specification. <a href="#8">8</a> </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Jurisdiction of formation:&nbsp; </em></strong>The laws  under which a given consortium may be formed, unfortunately, may be determined  more as a result of the attorney chosen to represent the new entity than by a  conscious weighing of the appropriateness of the laws of one jurisdiction over  another.&nbsp; In fact, corporate statutes,  and particularly not-for-profit corporate statutes, vary from jurisdiction to  jurisdiction.&nbsp; While those statutes have  tended to become progressively more similar over time than the opposite,  important differences can remain from state to state.&nbsp; <br>
                The  reasons for choosing one jurisdiction over another should include the  following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>Flexibility:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> How much freedom is permitted in structuring the entity?&nbsp; Can essentially all powers (other than the  election of directors) be vested in a Board of Directors, to provide for speed  and ease of governance, or must some powers be shared with members?&nbsp; Must the Board operate according to  traditional board rules, or can it provide for different methods of operation  (e.g., acting by less than unanimous written consent), in order to facilitate  the operations of what are increasingly likely to be virtual organizations with  a global board of directors?&nbsp; For  similar reasons, can alternate directors be appointed to substitute for  directors when they cannot attend a meeting?</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Familiarity:</em></strong>&nbsp; Consortia typically strive to set global standards, and therefore  to attract global membership.&nbsp; Even  within the US, the laws of small states may be less well known than those that  host the headquarters of many Fortune 500 companies.&nbsp; Outside of the US, only the laws of a few states would be  familiar with many potential members and their counsel.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Extraneous concerns:</em></strong>&nbsp; States vary in the degree to which they  differentiate among non-profit corporations.&nbsp;  As a result, a state that is more concerned with farm co-ops, churches,  fraternal organizations and public charities may have a less useful non-profit  statute than one that contemplates the needs of a broader range of organizations.&nbsp; </li>
                <li class="style2"><span class="style10"><em><strong>D</strong></em><strong><em>egree of regulation:</em></strong>&nbsp; </span>Some states  have more extensive social or other regulations (or just more regulations, full stop). <a href="#9">9</a> </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">This  author has formed over 50 consortia as not for profit membership corporations  under Delaware law, for a variety of reasons, including the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2">Delaware traditionally represents the most advanced and  progressive jurisdiction with respect to corporate law.</li>
                <li class="style2">Of all US jurisdictions, Delaware law is mostly likely to be  familiar to US and foreign lawyers.</li>
                <li class="style2">Delaware law provides unique flexibility with respect to the  operation of the board of directors of a non-stock corporation, making it  easier to conduct the affairs of a consortium with a board that typically  includes many busy international executives.</li>
                <li class="style2">The differences between Delaware corporations that have  stock and those that do not are minor, and almost always provide for additional  flexibility.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Happily, reincorporating in  Delaware is neither expensive nor difficult.&nbsp;  If the board or management of an existing consortium finds that it has  been created under laws that prove to be unduly restrictive, a new corporation  can be formed in Delaware, and the existing organization simply merged into the  newly created shell.</p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antitrust  Considerations</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Whether incorporated or not,  consortia need to adopt a number of policies at, or not long after,  inception.&nbsp; Those policies are necessary  to provide further guidance for the conduct of activities, as well as to  regulate behavior in order to steer clear of potential liabilities.&nbsp; One of the most important policies relates  to compliance with antitrust laws.</p>
              <p class="style2">By their nature, SSOs are  organizations that bring direct competitors together in the same room for the  purposes of engaging in joint action.&nbsp;  As a result, the antitrust laws &ndash; and the potential liabilities that can  arise from being insufficiently aware of their prohibitions&nbsp; - are particularly relevant to the  operations of SSOs.</p>
              <p class="style2">Happily, the antitrust laws in the United States  have become progressively more favorable over the last quarter century to  pro-competitive collaborative activity among competitors.&nbsp; For example, in 1983, Congress passed the  National Cooperative Research Act, which was later amended to cover production  as well (the Act was concurrently renamed the National Cooperative Research and  Production Act, and is commonly referred to as the NCRPA). <a href="#10">10</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">More recently, in December of 2005, Federal  Trade Commission Deborah Platt Majoras delivered a policy speech in which she  made it clear that the FTC looked with favor on the pro-competitive effects of  standard setting in general, and in particular would be open minded in  considering appropriately conducted disclosures of licensing terms during the  standards process (so call <em>ex ante</em> disclosure). <a href="#11">11</a> On October 30, 2006, the FTC made good on this  invitation, and issued a favorable business review letter to the VMEBus  International Trade Association (VITA), which had proposed amending its IPR  Policy to expressly require <em>ex ante</em> disclosure. <a href="#12">12</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">All of this good will on the part  of the regulators aside, the fact remains that those that engage in standard  setting and related activities must be mindful of where the boundaries of  permissible behavior are located, because the penalties for overstepping those  limits can be severe.&nbsp; Given that  consortia operate globally, the antitrust laws of many countries may bear upon  their activities, and both the specifics, as well as the underlying social  policies, of these laws can and do vary.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>United  States Antitrust Laws:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> While a comprehensive  review of even US antitrust law is far beyond the scope of this article, the  following will serve as a brief introduction to the type of concerns that those  that would form or participate in SSOs should be aware.</p>
              <p class="style2">Broadly stated, the basic objective  of the US antitrust laws is to preserve and promote competition and the free  enterprise system.&nbsp; These laws are  premised on the assumption that private enterprise and free competition are the  most efficient ways to allocate resources, to produce goods at the lowest  possible price and to assure the production of high quality products.&nbsp; These laws require that business people make  independent business decisions without consultation or agreement with  competitors.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">The US antitrust statutes of  principal concern to companies and individuals that take part in trade  association activities are Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the  Federal Trade Commission (&ldquo;FTC&rdquo;) Act.&nbsp;  These laws make illegal all contracts, combinations, and conspiracies  which are deemed to be in restraint of trade.</p>
              <p class="style2">Broadly speaking, the courts  have interpreted these laws as prohibiting those contracts and combinations  that have the effect of unreasonably restraining trade.&nbsp; A court will, therefore, examine all the  facts and circumstances surrounding the conduct in question in order to  ascertain whether the contract or combination is in violation of the law by  restraining trade unreasonably.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Many activities are, however,  regarded as unreasonable by their very nature and are therefore considered to  be illegal &ldquo;per se.&rdquo;&nbsp; Companies and  individuals are conclusively presumed to engage in these activities for no  other purpose than to restrain trade.&nbsp;  Practices within the per se category include agreements to fix prices,  agreements to boycott competitors, suppliers or customers, agreements to  allocate markets or limit production, and certain tie-in sales.&nbsp; A tie-in sale is one in which the customer  is required to purchase an unwanted item in order to purchase the product or  service desired.</p>
              <p class="style2">The legality of activities  of an SSO or other standards-related consortium and its members under the  antitrust laws is determined by the application of standards no different from  those used to determine the legality of the activities of other groups of  persons or firms.&nbsp; Special problems do  arise, however, from the fact that a consortium necessarily brings competitors  into a joint enterprise, and the act of bringing these competitors together  creates the means by which collusive action can be taken in violation of the  antitrust laws.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em><span class="style10">Penalties for Violations:&nbsp;</span> </em></strong>The US antitrust laws are enforced at the Federal  level by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of  Competition of the Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp;  State court actions may be brought by U.S. State attorneys-general or  injured parties under the antitrust laws of individual states as well.</p>
              <p class="style2">A criminal conviction for a  federal antitrust law violation may result in stiff fines for a consortium and  its members, jail sentences for individuals (including an individual acting in  his or her capacity as a corporate employee or officer) who participated in the  violation, and a court order disbanding the consortium, or severely limiting  its activities.&nbsp; In the past, several  foreign nationals have been sentenced to serve time in U.S. prisons, and  corporations convicted of such a criminal offense have been fined hundreds of  millions of dollars.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In addition, private persons or  firms may sue for damages under the Federal antitrust laws, and a company found  liable may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages suffered by  the plaintiff, as well as all of the plaintiff&rsquo;s costs of litigation and  attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>Antitrust policies and monitoring:</em></strong></span>&nbsp; Given the  above, it is not surprising, that consortia, like other trade associations,  require antitrust education for Boards of Directors, committee chairs and  members, as well as ongoing monitoring by legal counsel.&nbsp; As a result, the necessary capabilities of  counsel assisting in the formation and representation of a consortium include  knowledge of antitrust laws, and the duties of such counsel at the time of  formation include: </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="style2">Evaluating the goals and contemplated activities       of a prospective organization, and advising on how they may be most       appropriately conducted.</li>
                <li class="style2">Structuring the formation documents in such a       way as to protect against abusive activity, and providing for due process       where needed to protect members against such abuse.</li>
                <li class="style2">Advising on the most cost-effective practices for       ongoing legal review, based upon the budget of the new organization.</li>
                <li class="style2">Supplying appropriate antitrust policies for       adoption by the Board, and antitrust memoranda suitable to alert members       to prohibited conduct.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Following  formation, the management of a consortium must take care to  abide by the policies adopted, in order to lessen the chance of expensive mistakes. <a href="#13">13</a> </p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>III</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Intellectual Property Rights </strong></p>
              <p class="style2">The  second area that should be promptly addressed by adoption of a policy relates  to IPR.&nbsp; For decades, IPR policies for  SSOs were low priority items of little interest (and remain so in many industry  sectors).&nbsp; However, beginning with an  FTC consent decree agreed to by Dell Computer in 1995, under which Dell gave up  any right to charge royalties on patents it had not disclosed in the course of  a standard setting activity, those participating in SSOs active in the  information and communications technology (ICT) sectors began taking increasing  interest in the rules to which they would become subject when they participated  in a given SSO. <a href="#14">14</a>              </p>
              <p class="style2">For better or worse, intellectual  property rights (and particularly patents) lie at the heart of standard setting  and consortium activities. &nbsp;For a variety of reasons - not the least of  which is avoiding liability under antitrust and other laws - it is essential  for a consortium to adopt a carefully drafted, written IPR policy to govern its  activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, of course, it  must follow that policy, rather than relegate it to the status of a document in  a drawer.</p>
              <p class="style2">Equally unfortunately, the actual  terms of an IPR policy should be the opposite of what would be desired  elsewhere in the commercial world.&nbsp;  Newcomers to standard setting must therefore reorient their thinking to  accept that giving away rights in technology can be more advantageous than  charging for the same rights.&nbsp; The  biggest challenge for some lawyers can therefore be grasping the fact that  standard setting is about giving away rights in some technology in order to  make money on other technology. &nbsp;This means that those who would form a  consortium must enter into a sort of &quot;through the looking glass&quot;  world where patents are impediments rather than tools, royalties are unwanted  encumbrances, licenses exist for the sake of disclaiming rights, and competitors  are as welcome as partners.<br>
                  <br>
                  It is very hard for many individuals that have lived their lives in the  proprietary world of commercial R&amp;D to cross this threshold. &nbsp;Even  among those that are expert in the area of standard setting, there is a great  diversity of opinion over exactly what an IPR policy should say, although a  consensus has emerged regarding what such a policy should cover.&nbsp; And while many small companies take little  interest in the details of an IPR policy, lawyers representing companies  with large patent portfolios not surprisingly take a great interest in what the  individual terms for a specific SSO IPR policy should be, as well as in the  exact words used to establish those terms.&nbsp;  Because the stakes are so high, few large companies are willing to join  a new consortium until the IPR policy of that organization has been agreed  upon.</p>
              <p class="style2">As a result, creating an IPR policy has become a  major hurdle to clear in forming a new consortium, and can seriously delay the  launch of a new organization in consequence.&nbsp;  A major task for the founders, and the legal counsel selected to assist  them in forming a new consortium, is therefore achieving consensus as quickly  as possible on the substance and text of that document. <a href="#15">15</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">In order to put an effective IPR Policy into  action, commitments by members must be collected on standard forms, and then an  archive of these materials maintained on a perpetual basis.&nbsp; As a result, there is a technical and  administrative structure (often Web-based) that must be created soon after  formation as well, in order to enable the proper implementation of the IPR  Policy itself. <a href="#16">16</a> </p>
              <p><strong class="style10"><em>Policies and Procedures of the Technical Committee:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span class="style2">For an SSO, the companion to the IPR Policy is a detailed  document setting forth all of the day by day rules of the technical process,  such as notice and quorum requirements, meeting rules, chairperson duties, and  so on.&nbsp; This is the primary guide for  the chairs of committees, and should be sufficient to provide all of the rules  necessary to enable the technical process to function efficiently and  effectively.</span></p>
              <p class="style2">Prior to creating such a document, the technical  structure of the organization must be designed.&nbsp; For a consortium that wishes to develop and maintain a single  standard, the structure will obviously be simple, comprising a single technical  committee, possibly with a few working groups operating under it.&nbsp; If work will commence on multiple standards  from the beginning, however, attention must be paid to how any contradictions between  standards that are evolving simultaneously will be addressed and resolved. <a href="#17">17</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10">IV<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Tax Status</span> <a href="#18">18</a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>IPR Policies :</em></strong>&nbsp; </span>While most consortia do not operate at any  significant profit in any event, there are other obvious benefits to obtaining  tax-exempt status. &nbsp;The most obvious benefit, apart from generally not  having to pay taxes, is that the organization is freed from the chore of  seeking to &quot;zero out&quot; its profits at the end of each year. &nbsp;By  obtaining exempt status, financial planning for the organization is greatly  simplified. &nbsp;Given that most consortia are lightly staffed, simpler is  better.&nbsp; However, if it is impossible to  meet the requirements of tax exemption without restricting the activities that  would permit the organization to achieve its mission, it is better to forego  the small benefit that tax exemption may offer for what are, after all, the  typically break-even operations of a consortium.&nbsp; <br>
                It is also possible for a  consortium to have it both ways &ndash; conducting its tax exempt activities through  a parent organization, and its taxable operations (e.g., a trade show) through  a for-profit, taxable subsidiary.</p>
              <p class="style2">Happily, the majority of consortia can be formed  as federally tax-exempt trade associations without restricting their mission or  activities, most advantageously under IRS Section 501(c)(6). <a href="#19">19</a> &nbsp;Some consortia  and SDOs have also been formed as public charities under IRS Section 501(c)(3),  which offers certain advantages that are rarely advantageous for modern consortia. <a href="#20">20</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">On the other hand, both federal as  well as state laws are more restrictive for charities than for trade  associations.&nbsp; For example, a public  charity in Massachusetts that wished to dissolve would be required to submit  its plan of assets distribution to the state attorney general for review, and  for final approval by a state court.&nbsp; A  trade association would face no such mandated process, nor would it be required  to obtain an annual audit at such time as its annual income crossed a modest  threshold.</p>
              <p class="style2">In order to secure tax exemption,  a consortium must prepare and file a detailed application that describes its  proposed activities and budget, and which must be accompanied by its bylaws,  charter and other documentation.&nbsp; The  goal of the application is in large part to describe the &quot;tax exempt  purpose&quot; that the organization wishes to pursue.&nbsp; Since the grant of an exemption only applies conclusively to the  purpose and proposed activities as described, it is important that they be  described comprehensively.&nbsp; This may  mean that in some cases it is prudent to delay filing the application for up to  a year, if the full range of activities of the organization may only be  determined after public announcement of the new organization, and further  recruitment of members.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>Specific rules:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> A number of specific rules control which  types of organizations may, and may not, achieve tax exemption.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Qualifiers</span></em></strong><span class="style10"><em>:</em></span> There are  a number of steps that must be taken in order to obtain tax-exempt status.  &nbsp;As a first step, an organization must be organized in a fashion that will  satisfy certain qualification criteria set forth in at least one of the various  subsections of Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. &nbsp;The second  step is to file an application with the IRS seeking a ruling that the  organization is tax-exempt. &nbsp;While most people are more familiar with  charitable and educational organizations exempt under Section 501(c)(3), the  vast majority of technology consortia obtain their exempt status instead under  Section 501(c)(6).&nbsp; Section 501(c)(6)  grants tax-exempt status to:</p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&hellip;business leagues,  chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade or professional  football leagues..., not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings  of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.</p>
              <p class="style2">The definition of a business  league includes trade associations, and virtually all technology consortia that  obtain exempt status do so as trade associations. </p>
              <p class="style2">In order to obtain tax-exempt  status under Section 501(c)(6), there are a number of hurdles that must be  crossed. &nbsp;First, the organization has to be organized and operated as a  not-for-profit. &nbsp;This can be accomplished by incorporating under a  nonprofit or nonstock statute.&nbsp; Second, the organization cannot permit any  &quot;private inurement.&quot; &nbsp;That is, the net earnings of the  consortium cannot be distributed to members or shareholders either directly or  indirectly (e.g., through dividends or &quot;sweetheart&quot; deals with  members). </p>
              <p class="style2">Private inurement is not often an  issue, but it can arise where members contribute technology in exchange for  royalties or license fees that the IRS deems excessive (typically in excess of  an arm's-length amount). &nbsp;Another context where private inurement can  arise is where a founding member provides management services in exchange for a  management fee. &nbsp;Again, while management and license fees are not  impermissible on their face, those fees must be carefully set to avoid being in  excess of what would be paid to an unrelated third party for comparable  services or property.&nbsp; Typically, even  with careful disclosure of all details, the IRS will nevertheless request  further details regarding such relationships when they are noted in the  exemption application.</p>
              <p class="style2">A consortium must also meet the  definition of a business league. &nbsp;The statute does not define this term,  but IRS regulations and the courts have fleshed out a number of requirements  that must be satisfied in order to obtain tax-exempt status under Section  501(c)(6). &nbsp;Those requirements can be summarized as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2">The existence of a common business interest, </li>
                <li class="style2">The organization must as a primary activity promote this  common business interest,</li>
                <li class="style2">The activities of the entity must be directed to the  improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business, </li>
                <li class="style2">The organization cannot be engaged in a regular business of a  kind ordinarily carried on for profit, and </li>
                <li class="style2">The primary activities of the entity must not be confined to  the performance of particular services for individual members.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Notwithstanding the numerous tests  that must be met in order to be classified as a trade association, the  &quot;real&quot; test is whether the trade association is engaging primarily in  the conduct of activities which benefit an entire industry as opposed to the  interests of the individual members of the association only. &nbsp;With most  trade associations, there is a fine line between activities that benefit the  specific members and activities that benefit the entire industry in which those  members generally operate. &nbsp;The five tests enumerated above are all geared  towards making this determination.</p>
              <p class="style2">It is the focus on standards,  which have the potential to better the entire industry, that typically  qualifies SSOs as tax-exempt trade associations &ndash; provided that they make their  standards available to non-members and members alike.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is true even though only members may have an active role in  setting the standard, and may receive a discount in the pricing of  certification testing or other services relating to the standards, because  these benefits are viewed as being incidental to the overall benefit to the  industry. </p>
              <p class="style2">On the other end of the spectrum,  an organization that is nothing more than a joint marketing collaborative  typically will not qualify as a trade association because its activities are  focused on the improvement of business conditions for the individual members  themselves and not for a broader industry group. &nbsp;For example, if the  organization promulgates and promotes standards for its members only,  tax-exempt status would be difficult to achieve because the standards would  simply enhance the competitive position of the members vis-&agrave;-vis the industry  at large.</p>
              <p class="style2">The existence of a common business  interest is generally satisfied so long as the consortium represents an  established industry and addresses at least one business issue or concern common  to the members of that industry. &nbsp;Where the organization represents  members of multiple industries, a common business interest can be found where  all of the consortium members have common issues of one type or another.  &nbsp;The only distinction between a situation where there is a single clear  industry and a situation involving members of multiple industries is that the  IRS will generally apply greater scrutiny in determining a common business  interest where the membership represents more than one traditional industry. </p>
              <p class="style2">Having found a common business  purpose, the next criteria is that the organization &quot;promote&quot; the  common business interest. &nbsp;Activities that are in the nature of  &quot;particular services&quot; to the members or that are considered &quot;unrelated&quot;  to industry promotion do not promote the common business interest of its  members and weigh against exempt status. </p>
              <p class="style2">The simplest example of  &quot;promotion&quot; is industry marketing. &nbsp;It is critical to note,  however, that the marketing must be of the industry itself and not of the  individual member companies. &nbsp;Promotion will not satisfy this requirement  where the activities are comprised of simply advertising association member  companies' products. &nbsp;For example, a publication consisting of paid  advertisements by the association's members is a classic example of an activity  that does not adequately promote an industry. </p>
              <p class="style2">The third, fourth and fifth  requirements are actually very similar and the IRS and the courts have treated  them as different ways of saying the same thing. &nbsp;The third requirement is  the key to exemption in that the consortium activities must be directed toward  the improvement of conditions of one or more lines of business, as  distinguished from the performance of particular services for individual  members. &nbsp;This characteristic imposes two separate, interrelated  requirements: (a) the organization must represent one or mores lines of  business, and (b) it must not be primarily directed to performing particular  services for individual purposes. </p>
              <p class="style2">The &quot;line of business&quot;  requirement is quite similar to the industry requirement discussed previously.  &nbsp;The IRS has ruled that a trade association can satisfy the &quot;line of  business&quot; requirement even though the association members are from diverse  industries or professions so long as they focus on particular business issues  that are common to members of those diverse industries. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Disqualifiers:</span></em></strong> &nbsp;The  &quot;particular services&quot; proscription is sometimes more problematic for  consortia. &nbsp;The principal challenge in this area is to distinguish between  association services that chiefly benefit the industry as a whole, but would  also provide an incidental benefit to individual members, from those services  that are chiefly of value to members and their own businesses, with the  industry benefits subordinate.</p>
              <p class="style2">A &quot;particular service&quot;  is defined as a benefit that is merely a convenience or economy to members of  an association in the operation of their individual businesses. &nbsp;That is,  if a trade organization provides members with a low cost, or otherwise more  conveniently available service or product that its members would otherwise be  expected to obtain in the normal course of their business, then the association  may be found to be providing a &quot;particular service to its members.&quot;&nbsp;  As a matter of fact, in one case it has been held that &quot;any activity or  service . . . which would otherwise have to be done by or for the member in  order for him to properly to perform his business, must be classified as a  particular service.&quot; &nbsp;For example, providing insurance or consulting  services to the members of an association will typically be treated as a  provision of a &quot;particular service&quot; as these would relieve the  association members of obtaining the same services on an individual basis from  a non-exempt commercial business. </p>
              <p class="style2">The mere provision of some  &quot;particular services&quot; does not result in a loss of exempt status, but  a trade association may not be &quot;primarily&quot; engaged in the provision  of particular services. &nbsp;That typically means that so long as less than  50% of the activities and revenue of the association are comprised of  &quot;particular services&quot;, then the organization may still be treated as  exempt under Section 501(c)(6). &nbsp;Even if exempt, however, the fees for the  provision of &quot;particular services&quot; (or the dues allocated to those  services) are typically treated as &quot;unrelated business taxable  income.&quot;&nbsp; The organization will be required to pay taxes on this  revenue regardless of the organization's overall exempt status.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Process:</span></em></strong> Assuming  that all qualification criteria are satisfied, the specifics of obtaining  tax-exempt status are fairly straightforward.&nbsp; Following formation, the  consortium will file a Form 1024 with the IRS seeking a ruling that its  activities result in tax-exempt status.&nbsp; Unlike charitable organizations  exempt under Section 501(c)(3), which are required to obtain a favorable ruling  from the IRS, the statute does not require a ruling from the IRS that a Section  501(c)(6) organization is exempt.&nbsp; In other words, if the organization  otherwise meets all of the qualification criteria, then there is no requirement  that a ruling be obtained. </p>
              <p class="style2">Unfortunately, the IRS does not agree with this interpretation of  the statute (even though it is quite clear) and takes the position that an  organization cannot be exempt without a favorable ruling. </p>
              <p class="style2">In order to avoid any dispute, it  is standard practice to file a Form 1024 in all cases.&nbsp; This has the added  benefit of providing certainty of treatment in the event of an IRS audit.  &nbsp;Care must be taken in preparing the Form 1024 because the ruling obtained  is based strictly on the facts enumerated. &nbsp;If the consortium engages in  other activities, the ruling will not cover those activities and this can cause  a loss of exempt status notwithstanding a favorable determination.  &nbsp;Accordingly, a supplemental filing should be made whenever there is a  significant change in the activities or organizational structure of the  consortium after the date of its original application.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Operations as a Taxable Entity:</span></em></strong>&nbsp; If exemption appears to be unlikely, or is denied on application,  the consortium will be taxed in the same manner as any other taxable  entity.&nbsp; As a result, it is advisable to  operate as nearly as possible on a break-even basis until exemption has been  granted, or until a decision is made to abandon further efforts to seek  exemption after one or more exchanges with the IRS examiner reviewing the  exemption application. &nbsp;If that decision is made, it should be anticipated  that somewhat higher compliance costs will be encountered in connection with  making necessary tax filings on an ongoing basis.</p>

              <span class="style2">Most technology consortia are formed to promote  as well as create standards. <a href="#21">21</a> Promotion will often involve more  than simply raising awareness of the existence of standards, because in order  to achieve wide adoption, it is necessary for a standard to be well respected  as well as well known. &nbsp;This is particularly true in the case of standards  created to enable interoperability of products and technology services, where  such standards enable end-users to assemble systems bought from multiple  vendors.&nbsp; Interoperability has become  doubly important with the advent of the standards-based Internet and the Web,  which enable global communications and information exchange.&nbsp;              </span>
              <p class="style2">Accordingly, both vendors and  users place a high degree of reliance, and therefore value, on compliance with  effective standards to ensure that products purchased will &quot;plug and  play.&quot; &nbsp;The way in which vendors capitalize on this value can be by  forming a consortium to test and certify compliance with a standard, and to  create good will and brand recognition in a distinctive trademark that  indicates such compliance (&quot;WiFi&quot; is a good example).&nbsp; In order to maintain value in the market  recognition so created, a mechanism is needed by which the consortium can  assert the legal right to prevent false assertions of compliance.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  Consortia, like their commercial  members, achieve this result by creating distinctive trademarks and logos that  (in this case) relate to a given standard. &nbsp;The consortium also adopts a  policy which provides that these same marks may only be used in connection with  products that have successfully passed whatever regime it has established to  indicate compliance. &nbsp;Where a vendor falsely asserts compliance with a  trademarked standard, the consortium can revoke the vendor's right to use the  name of the specification and any consortium logos in connection with its  products.</p>
              <p class="style2">Planning for a proper  certification and trademark program is essential to the success of some  consortia (e.g., where consumer products are involved). &nbsp;The legal  preparations for such a program include the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2">Conduct of conflict searches in jurisdictions of interest  for the trademarks and logos to be used in connection with the program</li>
                <li class="style2">Creation of test suites, and preparation of license  agreements for such suites</li>
                <li class="style2">If a third party is to be used for certification testing,  negotiation of agreements with such vendor(s)</li>
                <li class="style2">Preparation of trademark usage guidelines</li>
                <li class="style2">Drafting of trademark licensing agreements for compliance or  certification marks and logos</li>
              </ul>
              <p><span class="style2">While trademark searches need be undertaken at  the time of formation, the other actions described above need not be taken  until a standard has actually been completed.&nbsp;  Nevertheless, the later requirements should be anticipated at the time  of formation, as well as any promotional expenses that will need to be incurred  in connection with the program.&nbsp; As a  result, the need for such an initiative should be assessed before the formal  launch of the consortium, and a careful assessment of the costs of such a  program should be included in developing the new organization's ongoing budget. <a href="#22">22</a> </span></p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>VI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">As the success or failure of a  consortium and its standards is in large part driven by the care with which it  is structured, it is important to take the time to properly form a consortium  from the outset.&nbsp; That structure must  then be properly implemented in documentation that provides effective tools for  governance, protection from liability, and flexibility of operation.&nbsp; The result should be an effective platform  that supports, rather than impedes, the activities of a consortium's members,  and allows the new organization to grow and adapt to changing market  circumstances.</p>
              <p class="style2">The combined experience of the  hundreds of already existing consortia that are in operation today has provided  a number of well-tested models upon which new organizations should be  based.&nbsp; Not only do these models offer  real-world examples of successful structures and documentation, but utilizing  such antecedents should facilitate recruitment of members that are already  members of, and comfortable with, earlier-formed organizations.</p>
              <p class="style2">That said, simply copying the  membership structure or documents of an existing organization is no more likely  to result in a robust result than copying another SSOs standards.&nbsp; In each case, and as demonstrated in the  first installment of this article, the most appropriate generic model must be  adapted to the goals, target membership, required activities and other unique  circumstances of the new initiative, with the legal language following rather  than leading the planning process.</p>

One reason that an LLC structure has sometimes  been employed by organizations with limited membership is to avoid the duties  that directors of a traditional corporation would have to represent the  interests of all members.&nbsp; In this case,  language is added to the LLC operating agreement (which acts as the surrogate  for corporate bylaws) that explicitly disclaims any such obligations.&nbsp; As a result, each member entitled to appoint  a manager of the LLC may instruct its representative to act solely in the  interests of the member that appoints her.&nbsp;  That individual may then so act, without concerns over personal  liability.</p>

Degree of regulation also becomes significant  when considering where to base a consortium, regardless of where it is legally  formed.&nbsp; For example, the same  consortium that has chosen to obtain tax exemption under IRS Section 501(c)(6)  as a trade association would not be required to file for a separate tax  exemption in Massachusetts &ndash; but would in California.</p>

This case received wide attention in  the press and sharply focused the attention of many companies, for the first  time, on consortium IPR policies. The FTC began its investigation when Dell  attempted to enforce a patent relating to &quot;VL-bus&quot; technology and  centered upon whether the patent was enforceable in light of the fact that,  contrary to VESA's IPR policy, a Dell representative had failed to disclose the  patent to the Video Electronics Standards Association (&quot;VESA&quot;) during  the VL-bus standard development process. The defendant brought numerous  counterclaims and Dell ultimately settled. As part of the consent decree whose  issuance ended the FTC's investigation, Dell agreed that the patents at issue  would not be enforced against ML-bus standard implementers, because they had  not been disclosed by Dell to VESA.</p>

              <p class="style2"><a name="19"></a>19. This statement demands some qualification.&nbsp; But for an approximately 24-month period  spanning 2002 - 2004, the author's law firm was successful in gaining tax  exemption for scores of consortia, beginning in 1989.&nbsp; During this brief interregnum, the senior IRS staff in its  Washington office raised a number of objections that had never been raised  before.&nbsp; For example, the Service  insisted that if more than one SSO was developing a standard for a given  industry, then none of the SSOs active in that area could claim to be representing  &quot;the industry&quot; &ndash; a requirement for achieving exemption.&nbsp; As a result, in an emerging area such as  wireless, no SSO would qualify for tax exemption, unless all merged into one.&nbsp; Had the Service applied this same analysis  to existing SSOs, many venerable SDOs as well as consortia could have been  stripped of their tax-exempt status. Happily, the Service ceased raising this objection as suddenly and mysteriously as it had originally begun asserting it some two years before.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="20"></a>20. &nbsp;For example, individual members of 501(c)(3)  organizations may be able to deduct their membership fees, while the  organizations themselves may send mailings at less than commercial postal  prices.&nbsp; Historically, these rights were  significant for SDOs with large memberships made up of individuals.</p>
              <p class="style2"><a name="21"></a>21. Some consortia are formed exclusively for the  purpose of promoting and/or certifying compliance with standards developed by  other organizations (typically are SDOs, which rarely support such  activities).&nbsp; One of the best current  examples of this practice can be found in the WiFi Alliance, WiMedia Alliance,  and WiMax Forum, each of which was formed to expedite the adoption of wireless  standards developed by IEEE working groups.</p>

              <div align="left" class="style56"><strong>January 17, 2007 @ 2:57 PST</strong></div>
                <span class="style2">Views: 19,161</span></p>
              <p class="style2">                Regular readers will be aware that OOXML,  the Microsoft Office XML-based formats adopted by Ecma in early December of  last year, are now in the adoption queue at in the ISO/IEC Joint Technical  Committee 1 (JTC1).&nbsp; Ecma is a &quot;Class A Liaison&quot; partner of the  ISO/IEC, which enables it to use the same Fast Track process that national  standards bodies use.&nbsp; That process takes six months -&nbsp;the same  amount of time that the Publicly Available Standard, or PAS, process takes (the  route used by OASIS to submit ODF to ISO/IEC) &ndash; but has two steps rather than  one.&nbsp; The practical result is  nevertheless much the same.</p>
              <p class="style2">                During the first one-month step, any of  the c. 60 current Principal and Observer level members of ISO/IEC may submit  &quot;contradictions,&quot; a term which is unfortunately (as we will see) not  defined, but which means aspects in which a proposed standard conflicts with  (at least) already adopted ISO/IEC standards &ndash; the ambiguity then passing to  what &quot;conflicts&quot; means, and whether only standards are of concern (as  compared to, for example, ISO/IEC Directives).&nbsp; Those contradictions must  then be &quot;resolved&quot; (which does not necessarily mean eliminated), and  these resolutions are then presented back to the members during the second  stage to consider as part of the voting package.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                During this second, five-month step,  other objections, questions and comments can be offered by not only by P and O  Level members, but also by the 157 nations entitled to be heard under the rules  of the World Trade Association.&nbsp; (For  more detail on the rules relating to contradictions and what can be raised  during this phase, see the <a href="http://opendocumentfellowship.org/node/296">excellent  writeup</a> at the OpenDocument Fellowship site.)</p>
              <p class="style2">                While the unprecedented size of OOXML  (6,039 pages, to be precise) has made performing a detailed review a daunting  task, more and more contradictions are being found by those that are slogging  their way through on this very tight timeframe.&nbsp; Here is a sampling of  those issues that people have brought to my attention:<br>
                              <br>
                Starting with the somewhat silly, OOXML does not conform to ISO 8601:2004  &quot;Representation of Dates and Times.&quot;&nbsp; Instead, OOXML section  3.17.4.1, &quot;Date Representation,&quot; on page 3305, requires that  implementations replicate a Microsoft bug that dictates that 1900 is a leap  year, which in fact it isn't.&nbsp; Similarly, in order to comply with OOXML, a  product would be required to use the WEEKDAY() spreadsheet function, and  therefore assign incorrect dates to some days of the week, as well as  miscalculate the number of days between certain dates. </p>
              <p class="style2">                More substantively in the contradiction  department, OOXML does not follow ISO 639 &quot;Codes for the Representation of  Names and Languages.&quot;&nbsp; That standard defines a list of codes that are  maintained by a Registration Authority charged with keeping the list current as  ethno-linguistic changes evolve.&nbsp; Instead, section 2.18.52,  &quot;ST_LangCode (Two Digit Hexadecimal Language Code)&quot; (page 2531) says  that you must use a fixed list of numeric language codes rather than the  already existing set that provide for interoperability among other  standards-compliant products &ndash; a not unimportant factor in a text standard.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Similarly, 6.2.3.17 &quot;Embedded Object  Alternate Image Requests Types (page 5679) and section 6.4.3.1 &quot;Clipboard  Format Types&quot; (page 5738) refer back to Windows Metafiles or Enhanced  Metafiles &ndash; each of which are proprietary formats that have hard-coded  dependencies on the Windows operating system itself.&nbsp; OOXML should instead  have referenced ISO/IEC 8632 &quot;Computer Graphics Metafile&quot; &ndash; a  platform neutral standard.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Taking the external reference issue  further, I'm told that parts of OOXML can't be implemented by your typical  programmer at all without technical assistance from Microsoft, as they refer  not only to proprietary Microsoft products, but to undocumented parts of them  as well &ndash; which violates the General Principles of ISO/IEC Directives, Part  2.&nbsp; Consider the following, from section 2.15.3.26 (page 2199):</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><strong><em>2.15.3.26  footnoteLayoutLikeWW8 (Emulate Word 6.x/95/97 Footnote Placement)</em></strong> </p>

                <p class="style2"><em>[Guidance: To faithfully replicate this  behavior, applications must imitate the behavior of that application, which  involves many possible behaviors and cannot be faithfully placed into narrative  for this Office Open XML Standard.

              <p class="style2">                Other parts of OOXML refer to OLE,  macros/scripts, encryption and DRM &ndash; none of which are fully described.&nbsp;  Nor has Microsoft stated whether necessary information will be supplied on a  non-discriminatory basis to all (or at all).</p>
              <p class="style2">                And taking that concern a step further,  consider the fact that OOXML also apparently violates section 2.14 of the  ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, in that not all of what it takes to implement OOXML  appears to be covered by Microsoft's patent pledge, in two respects.</p>
              <p class="style2">                First, the pledge does not explicitly  cover material that is referenced, but not included in the specification, and  second, the Microsoft patent commitment does not cover optional features.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sections of OOXML that are not fully described include those that require  compliant implementations to mimic the behavior of Microsoft products, such as  those products and capabilities referred to above (OLE, etc.)&nbsp; Microsoft  will need to clarify whether its patent commitment will in fact extend to these  requirements.&nbsp; Potentially, these concerns would involve large portions of  OOXML, in contradiction of the ISO/IEC requirement that more than a bare-bones  implementation must be permitted without fear of infringement.</p>
              <p class="style2">                All in all, as the waitress in the Monty  Python vignette would doubtless have observed (if contradictions were rats),  &quot;Rather a lot, actually.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                As the February 5 deadline for reporting  contradictions approaches, I expect that you'll be hearing of many more  examples such as these.&nbsp; Eventually, they will all become publicly  available, along with the proposed resolutions.&nbsp; Some, such as the patent  pledge ambiguities, are clearly addressable by Microsoft if it wishes to do so.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Other contradictions would seem to be  impossible to resolve given the nature of OOXML itself, the stated purpose of  which is to describe a single vendor's product &ndash; bugs, rats&nbsp;and all. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Epilogue, added January 31, 2007:</em></strong>The American National  Standards Institute (ANSI) is the U.S. representative to JTC 1.&nbsp; For document formats, the ANSI member  organization that was delegated responsibility for considering what response  the US should make regarding OOXML is the International Committee for  Information Technology Standards, more commonly referred to simply as  &quot;INCITS.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">                Yesterday, I learned that the Executive Board of INCITS decided  earlier in the day <em>not</em> to propose to ANSI that any contradictions need  be identified between OOXML and any ISO/IEC standards, Directives or other rules.&nbsp; The reason is that Microsoft, which has a  member on the committee, has persuaded a sufficient number of members of the  Executive Board to adopt a very conservative definition for a  &quot;contradiction&quot; &ndash; that definition being essentially that a contradiction  arises only where a system could not run operate two products, each of which  implemented one of the two specifications in question.&nbsp; You can see the same statement referred to  in the blog of Microsoft's Brian Jones, who describes the purpose of the contradiction  period, and the definition of a contradiction as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"> [The Contradiction Period]&hellip;is  where you want to make sure that the approval of this ISO spec won't cause  another ISO standard to break. In the case of OpenXML, there really can't be a  contradiction because it's always possible to implement OpenXML alongside other  technologies. For instance, OpenOffice will soon have support for ODF and  OpenXML. </p>
                <p class="style2">                An example of a contradiction  would be if there was a standard for wireless technology that required the use  of a certain frequency. If by using that frequency you would interfere with  folks using another standard that also leverages that frequency, then there may  be a contradiction. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                Rather a high bar for a standard, and a low one for process quality,  I should say.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Happily, INCITS will forward to ANSI the many comments that have  been delivered to it from many quarters.&nbsp;  You can view those comments <a href="http://www.incits.org/DIS29500/DIS29500.htm">here</a>.&nbsp; Much of this input was produced as a result  of a heroic effort by Groklaw's Pamela Jones and her volunteers, who set uptwo  very impressive pages at Groklaw, in Wiki format. The <a href="http://www.grokdoc.net/index.php/EOOXML_objections">first</a> allows interested parties to  find and log in contradictions and objections, while the <a href="http://www.grokdoc.net/index.php/EOOXML_at_JTC-1">second</a> tracks the ISO/IEC process. Pamela's own detailed  writeup can be found <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2007011720521698">here</a>.</p>
              <p class="style2">                All of which raises the question of whether the effort to limit  the number of issues that are formally identified as &quot;contradictions&quot;  will prove to be tactically smart or ultimately foolish?&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Given that the same input is public, and can be taken into account  in the ultimate voting, it strikes me as foolish.&nbsp; When issues exist, I believe that they are better confronted than  ignored.&nbsp; People that have strong  feelings and take the time to express them would always prefer to be  heard.&nbsp; And when those people are also  customers, it is a risky business to brush their concerns aside. </p>

                <p><span class="style56"><em>#45</em></span><strong class="style38"><em> Product Evolution and Standards "Swarms"</em></strong></p>
                <p class="style2">Three recent news clips highlight the disorderly, but ultimately  productive, way in which products and standards evolve in tandem during times  of innovation. </p>
                <p class="style2">                  The first clip is a press release announcing the completion of a  new <a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070104005821&newsLang=en">USB connector</a> design  standard.&nbsp; A really <em>small</em> connector design. How small? That large  object to the left of the connector in <a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/newsstory.aspx?CIaNID=43958&src=site-marq">this picture</a>&nbsp; looks like a  flat camera battery to me. The reason for creating the new standard is because  mobile devices are getting smaller at the same time that more and more features  (camera, video, music, wireless, etc.) are being crammed inside a single mobile  device.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The second article&nbsp;provides an update on a delayed <a href="http://www.computeractive.co.uk/personal-computer-world/news/2171971/wireless-usb-certified-q1">wireless USB</a> standard that would  eliminate the need for a connector at all. And the third announces the  completion of a new WiFi-compatible standard to make <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/007285.html%20">mobile security</a> as easy to set up as the push of a button &ndash;  whether you are accessing data wirelessly or physically,&nbsp;using  a&nbsp;USB&nbsp;connector. As the standard is extended, other wireless  standards (like Near Field Communications &ndash; a very short range standard) will  be supported as well.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  You can expect that the devices you buy in the next year or two  will use one, two or even all three of these standards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or you  might see completely different connection and data-transfer standards in use,  all chosen from what might be called a&nbsp;&quot;swarm&quot; of overlapping  standards that are continuously being developed around mobile devices.&nbsp;  Logically,&nbsp;you might wonder whether this is a good thing, or simply yet  another case of too many standards being created to do the same job.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  In this case, I think it's the former rather than the  latter.&nbsp; Let's see if evolution in the physical world provides an example  of why this would be so.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  In a mature natural ecosystem, it's difficult for a new species to  get a foothold, because every&nbsp;niche is already filled with one or more  other creatures or plants, each of&nbsp;whose development has been optimized to  maximally exploit that niche.&nbsp; The same tends to be true in a mature  commercial system as well, where launching a disruptive technology requires  great coordination among competitors in order to displace an incumbent, as I  pointed out in my last blog entry, titled <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070104044420309">Standards and Disruptive Technologies</a>.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  But - in nature, this stable applecart is regularly and frequently  (in geologic time, that is) upset by a variety of causes,&nbsp;such as dramatic  climactic changes,&nbsp;the formation of land bridges that allow previously  separated species to intermix, and&nbsp;massive meteor strikes, among other  catastrophes. On several occasions, these disasters have been sufficiently  massive to result in unimaginable waves of extinction, wiping out 60% or more  of all species on earth.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  When this happens, speciation has a clean slate to work with, and  evolution runs rampant. Countless new species evolve in weird and wonderful  ways as they compete to share in the sudden wealth of opportunities. Most of  these species die out over time, as the best-adapted win, and a new period of  relative stasis sets in.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  The same sort of event is occurring with increasing frequency in  the modern world of technology. The advent of wireless technology provides an  excellent example. Once cell phones became ubiquitous, people became used to  carrying a device around wherever they went. More recently, WiFi has  conditioned us to want the Internet everywhere, all the time. At the same time,  there have been multiple technological advances, including the ability to  dramatically miniaturize all sorts of devices and capabilities.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  As a result of&nbsp;these&nbsp;convergences, the meteor has indeed  struck the telecommunications industry, and the&nbsp;race has been on to exploit  the new commercial niches enabled by these advances. The result? First, music  players, PDAs and cell phones with enough features to require a 200 page  manual, and then the increasing consolidation of all these capabilities  (camera, video, computing, phone, games, music, and so on) into a single  device.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  In this type of explosively developing environment, there's no  time for everyone to agree on a single standard for every purpose &ndash; if they  did, product development would grind to a halt. Nor would the best standard  necessarily be agreed upon in each case. By pushing the envelope simultaneously  on both technological, product and standards development, more creative options  are developed and tried (just as in the post-catastrophe real world),  and&nbsp;a richer set of features and options becomes available for both  vendors and customers to sample. Some of these standards and technologies will  go even farther than their original proponents hoped or expected, while others  will fall short. Ultimately, some will make the grade, and most of the others  will die. In open source, the same winnowing will doubtless eventually occur  among the many Linux distributions that have dropped a bomb on proprietary  operating systems. Some will find and flourish in discrete niches, while others  will wither away.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  This is the context in which I view the connectivity standards I  noted above.&nbsp; Each one, as well as others that may be announced in today's  news, is part of just one of the&nbsp;rapidly evolving standard swarms that can  be found today. In the case of data transfer, device vendors can pick and  choose among multiple options and select the best solution for their  product.&nbsp; And at the same time, fierce competition will continue between  the developers of each competing standard, all of whom will try to push its  envelope as far and as fast as possible &ndash; something that would not happen in  the absence of competition.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  This rapid, albeit redundant,&nbsp;innovation is a good thing, and  indicative of a healthy and competitive commercial ecosystem. The key, of  course, is to know the difference between a stable system, where developing  multiple standards to do the same job may sometimes create inefficiency and  inconvenience, and a dynamically developing system.&nbsp; The  former&nbsp;situation provides clear guidance for standards developers, but the  latter presents a classic chicken and egg paradox: We need&nbsp;standards when  are products are done, but we don't really know yet exactly what we want those  standards to do.&nbsp; But if we launch enough initiatives, it will probably  all turn out all right.</p>
                <p class="style2">                  Or,  to paraphrase a former first lady, in times of rapid innovation, it takes a  swarm of standards to raise a new technology.</p>
