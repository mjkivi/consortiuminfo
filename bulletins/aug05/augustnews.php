Others feel it's just politics as usual. Whatever the reason, it's a clear indication that the Chinese want a strong voice in deciding how RFID will be used in global trade. And, if Wal*Mart can be viewed as a 5,000 lb. gorilla (that's used to getting what it wants), China may well be a 10,000 lb. gorilla. <a href="http://www.aimglobal.org/members/news/templates/rfidinsights.asp?articleid=407&zoneid=24"> ...Full Story</a></p>

At 26, he went from a promising young cadre in the State Planning bureaucracy to an accidental Tiananmen Square refugee.

              <strong>eWeek, July 18, 2005&nbsp;-- </strong>The fight to keep software patents out of Europe could change the patent landscape in the United States, too. The last few months have been mainly filled with bad news for those who support innovation in technology and fight against bad laws and policies that mainly serve to prevent innovation. Things were looking pretty bleak, and the fight to keep software patents out of Europe looked like it was going to go down for the count as well. But then finally it happened: good news! The members of the European Parliament stood their ground, showed up in force and soundly defeated the software patents proposal (648-14, with 18 abstentions). <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1836687,00.asp"> ...Full Story</a> </p>

                  <strong>Michael Kanellos<br>
                CNETNews.com August 6, 2005 --</strong> &nbsp;Lawyers, companies, inventors and politicians all agree that the nation's patent system is in desperate need of reform. They cite concerns about proliferating litigation, questionable licenses and a potential decline in American competitiveness. The question is how to reform: For all the complaints, little consensus has emerged on how to fix the system. In the worst-case scenarios, misguided reform efforts could unleash unintended consequences.... The issue is coming to a head in Washington, where committees in the House and Senate are planning hearings on a host of proposals to change the nation's patent law and how the Patent and Trademark Office operates.

                CNETNews.com, August 1, 2005</strong> &nbsp;-- You wouldn't know it from a political debate veering between labor standards in Nicaragua and the evils of protectionism, but one major section of CAFTA will export some of the more controversial sections of U.S. copyright law. Once it takes effect, CAFTA will require Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua to mirror the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's broad prohibition on bypassing copy-protection technology. This prohibition, of course, has been problematic in the United States. Courts have interpreted it as barring news organizations from linking to DVD-descrambling utilities, and lawyers have invoked it to stifle discussion of security vulnerabilities and even prevent conference presentations from taking place. <a href="http://news.com.com/Court+blocks+security+conference+talk/2100-1028_3-996836.html?tag=nl">...Full Story</a></p>

NYTimes.com July 31, 2005&nbsp;-- </strong>&quot;EXCITING,&quot; &quot;uninteresting&quot; and &quot;not exciting&quot; don't seem like technical terms. But they show up a lot in United States patent application No. 20,050,160,457, titled &quot;Annotating Programs for Automatic Summary Generation.&quot; It seems to be about baseball. The inventors have apparently come up with software that can detect the portions of a baseball broadcast that contain what they call &quot;excited speech,&quot; as well as hits (what I call &quot;excited ball&quot;) and automatically compile those portions into a highlights reel. If the patent is granted, after a review process that is likely to take three years, it will be assigned to the inventors' employer, Microsoft.

                CNETNews.com, July 28, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- Amazon.com has received a public airing of its patent application for an online marketplace where consumers search and pay for Web services. The patent application, filed last year and published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, marks the online retailing giant's latest attempt to make inroads into consumers' wallets. Amazon, in its latest filing, is seeking to patent its idea for creating a marketplace where third-party Web services providers can link up with consumers. In its role as an intermediary for the marketplace, Amazon would collect a fee from companies providing the service. In its filing, Amazon notes that after receiving a customer's payment for a third-party Web service, it will provide 'at least some of the obtained payment for the subscriptions to the third-party Web services provider that registered the... service'. <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1038_3-5808591.html"> ...Full Story</a></p>

                <strong>Gesmer Updegrove July 20, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- On July 12, 2005, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in a case that has had patent attorneys holding their collective breath. In Phillips v. AWH Corp., the Federal Circuit attempted to clear up years of confusion and inconsistent rulings, explaining how the operative language in patents is to be interpreted. The Court also spoke to the standard to be used on appeal, when deciding whether trial courts have interpreted &ldquo;patent claim&rdquo; language correctly. While the topic seems to be one only an inventor or his lawyer could love, viewed in context, the Phillips decision represents an important milestone in a ten year journey that has transformed patent jurisprudence. The journey started in 1995, with the Federal Circuit Court&lsquo;s decision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. The Federal Circuit concluded in that case that the scope of a patent should not depend on facts and circumstances particular to the inventor, but rather, it should be divined exclusively from the official patent documents themselves and from objective references, such as treatises and dictionaries. Divorcing patent claim interpretation from traditional factual inquiry meant two things. First, it meant that judges, not juries, were responsible for deciding what the terminology used in a patent claim actually meant. Second, it meant that a court hearing an appeal of that determination (i.e., the Federal Circuit) need not give any deference to the trial court&rsquo;s conclusions. The appeals court was to reach its own conclusions de novo &ndash; a Latin term essentially meaning &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/advisory/072005.php"> ...Full Story</a></p>

Windows still dominates the PC world. About 90 percent of all desktops, laptops and even PDAs are powered by Microsoft, according to reports by Gartner and IDC.

Or perhaps you were one of those struggling to grasp new concepts being explored while the instructor raced on to new, additional material. A new training system developed through an EU project will soon change all of this and bring the instruction down (or up) to suit individual students' needs. The Diogene system uses advanced semantic Web technologies, such as metadata and ontologies, to manage the training information. This allows it to intelligently infer when a student is showing signs of struggling and automatically recommend remedial coursework to get a student back on track or to fill in gaps that may have occurred in the student's normal coursework progression. <a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/1004/Default.aspx"> ...Full Story</a></p>

Fourteen years on, he tells BBC how blogging is closer to his original idea about a read/write Web. Berners-Lee: &quot;[The Web is] a new medium -- it's a universal medium and it's not itself a medium which inherently makes people do good things, or bad things.

                TechWorld, August 1, 2005</strong>&nbsp;-- Warring factions of vendors have finally reached an agreement to co-operate on development of the next high-speed wireless LAN standard. IEEE standards officials this week said that the planned joint proposal could be ready for an initial vote in November. The three factions said at an 802.11n task-force meeting held this month in San Francisco that they are &quot;working together to create a single merged proposal,&quot; according to a short statement from the task force issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The proposed standard is expected to be available at an 802.11n meeting in California, during the week of Sept. 18 and should be ready for review and a possible vote by the entire 802.11 working group in November, said Nancy Vogtli, the working group's publicity chairman. <a href="http://www.techworld.com/mobility/news/index.cfm?newsid=4132"> ...Full Story</a></p>

                PC World August 19, 2005</strong> &nbsp;-- Never underestimate the power of a name. That's the single greatest takeaway I found in a recent study offered up in support of HD-DVD, one of two competing formats in the race for a next-generation disc format with the capacity required for high-definition content. And according to this study, HD-DVD's familiar sound is going to serve it well in the coming format war--which is not a surprising conclusion, considering the study was commissioned by HD-DVD's backers.In July I looked at research released by the Blu-ray Disc Association, the group pushing HD-DVD's rival format. Unlike the more abstractly focused Blu-ray Disc study, which for the most part asked consumers to express general preferences regarding next-generation optical technology without getting into specific formats, the Warner study specifically pitted HD-DVD against Blu-ray Disc. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,122211,00.asp"> ...Full Story</a>

But if the Microsoft chairman was betting on Sender ID to play a major role in achieving that goal, it looks like a losing bet. The Microsoft-backed protocol to identify e-mail senders aims to stem spam and phishing by making it harder for senders to forge their addresses and by improving filtering. <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-7355_3-5824234.html"> ...Full Story</a>

                <strong>Open Geospatial Consortium August 12, 2005</strong> &nbsp;-- There's a bit of invisible magic enabling the mapping website that shows the current positions of the sailing vessels in this year's Rolex Fastnet race from the Isle of Wight to Plymouth. Visitors to http://www.netandsea.com/fastnetrace/ see colorful maps from Netency with regularly updated data on 10 of the 250 yachts. But what pulls all the data together underneath? Elegant open geospatial standards. Netency has covered a series of races on its website since January of this year. The Rolex Fasnet Race is the fifth. How does the company &quot;custom build&quot; a website for each race? It takes advantage of Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC) standards that make calling one map as easy as calling another, no matter what software in the background. Netency can call different background maps for different races from different servers across the world. The real time data on boat locations and winds are automatically overlain to create the real time maps. &quot;OGC specifications were really an important part of the architecture from its conception, in particular the OGC Web Map Service (WMS). The standard provides such flexibility to the website architecture. We can change the rendering of map by just referencing another WMS server!&quot; noted Didier Caillon, the technical lead at Netency. <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/press/?page=pressrelease&year=0&prid=234"> ...Full Story</a></p>
