                      <strong>Financial  Times/FT.com September 1, 2005</strong> -- The state of Massachusetts has laid out a plan to switch all its workers away from Microsoft's Word, Excel and other desktop software applications, delivering what would be one of the most significant setbacks to the software company's battle against open-source software in its home market. The state said yesterday that all electronic documents "created and saved" by state employees would have to be based on open formats, with the switch to start at the beginning of 2007. Documents created using Microsoft's Office software are produced in formats that are controlled by Microsoft, putting them outside the state's definition.  ...<a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/e8fc5cce-1a85-11da-b7f5-00000e2511c8.html">Full Story </a></p>

The state described the plan in a  posting made to its Web site earlier this week as part of a public review  process which ends Sept. 9.

Eric Kriss, Secretary of  Administration &amp; Finance for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, told CRN on  Friday that Massachusetts had concerns about the openness of Microsoft XML  schemas as well as with potential patent issues that could arise in the future.  &quot;What we've backed away from at this point is the use of a proprietary  standard and we want standards that are published and free of legal  encumbrances, and we don't want two standards,&quot; Kriss added. ...<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39216391,00.htm">Full Story </a></p>

The  commonwealth is inviting public comment until today on its plan to switch  software only to those applications that support the OpenDocument standard for  XML-based (define) text, spreadsheets and charts.

                        Boston.com,  September 14, 2005</strong> -- Microsoft Corp. has launched an assault on a  Massachusetts government plan to move computer networks at all state agencies  onto an open-file format by January 2007. Such a move, if approved, could  displace Microsoft's profitable Office software and, if followed by other  government bodies across the country and abroad, could threaten Microsoft's  dominance on desktop computers in the public sector. The company now holds more  than 90 percent of the global market in office productivity software. ...<a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/09/14/microsoft_fights_bid_to_drop_office_software/">Full  Story </a></p>

                      <strong>CIO  Government September 20, 2005 </strong>&nbsp;--&nbsp; In a subtle rebuke to Microsoft, IBM is  warning vendors will have to be far more responsive to the mandates of  government and business as governments around the world embrace open standards  and open source. The warning came after the US State of Massachusetts unveiled  plans earlier this month to phase out Microsoft Office in favour of office  productivity suites that support an open-document format from the OASIS  standards body. ...[A]s a number of bloggers have pointed out, government  officials in Massachusetts, Europe, and elsewhere have repeatedly warned the  company to stop posturing and instead address customers' calls for unrestricted  interoperability. Now there are signs many other governments are paving the way  for adoption of XML-based office formats, which is likely to drive the rest of  the industry to follow suit. This has led to speculation that Microsoft might  end up being stuck with a proprietary format no-one wants to use. ...<a href="http://www.cio.com.au/index.php/id;555613343;fp;512;fpid;2147145428">Full Story </a></p>

                      <strong>By: Lee Gesmer/Joe  Laferrera</strong><br />
                      <strong>Gesmer  Updegrove LLP September 12, 2005</strong>&nbsp; -- This month, the Eight Circuit Court of  Appeals issued a decision in Davidson &amp; Assoc. (d/b/a Blizzard  Entertainment, Inc.) v. Jung. This is the latest in a growing line of cases  dealing with attempts to use the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to prevent  competition through interoperability. In Blizzard, the plaintiff was a  developer of computer games. The games were intended to connect to Blizzard&rsquo;s  own network on the Internet, allowing far-flung players to compete against each  other online. The company sued the defendants, who had developed a competing,  alternative network designed to be compatible with Blizzard&rsquo;s games....Though  offensive use of the DMCA to prohibit inter-operability is still an  unpredictable game, contractual steps can help alleviate the uncertainty. In  the Blizzard case, a simple click-wrap agreement trumped the defendants&rsquo;  statutory &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; right to reverse engineer. By handcuffing the public&rsquo;s  ability to experiment with a product in this way, a developer may impose a  practical bar to third parties trying to create interoperable parts or  services. In these circumstances, the reach of the DMCA may be secondary, with  the inquiry focusing instead on the scope and enforceability of the contractual  prohibition against reverse engineering. <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/advisory/090805.php">...Full Story</a></p>

This time, a specification is being  offered to the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), and does not include  IBM among its sponsors. In a way, it's a sign of the times, and a reflection  how much things can change over time in the technology industry. The initial  Web services standards went to only a few core capability consortia, such as  the W3C and OASIS, while the suite of Web services and (now Service Oriented  Architecture standards as well) now extends in various directions, and  therefore logically looks for the support of a wider array of consortia. The  team of submitters for some time now often includes former Microsystems  archenemy, and now ally, Sun Microsystems. And the concept of a group of  companies deciding what standards are needed outside of a consensus-based  standard setting organization, and what these standards should address before  offering them to such a standards body, no longer excites comment.

                      <strong>Cover  Pages September 19, 2005</strong> -- Microsoft and eleven industry partners have  submitted the Web Services for Management (WS-Management) specification (V1,  Edition 3) to DMTF for further refinement and finalization as a Web  services-based management standard. WS-Management describes a general  SOAP-based protocol for managing systems such as PCs, servers, devices, Web  services, and other manageable entities. The Catalog describes default metadata  formats used with the WS-Management Protocol. ...<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-09-17-a.html">Full Story</a></p>

It's also close enough now that  hard facts and figures can begin to be cited on costs, vendors, first markets  and so on. And, in a reprise of the boon for owners of tall buildings in the  early years of cell phones, prime urban, campus and similar high-rise locations  for WiMax base stations will be at a premium -- and reap a premium rent from  erstwhile WiMax service providers. The following article provides a concise  overview of what the near-term future for WiMax will look like. For a more  qualified opinion, see the second article (requires registration).</em></p></td>

Within two days, Leavitt said, he will select  17 members from federal and state government and from industry, including  health care providers, insurers and IT vendors, to form the American Health  Information Community. Interoperability will jump-start a market and spur  adoption of such health IT systems as electronic health records, Leavitt  said....
