                  <p align="left"><strong><em> <span class="style2">Introduction: </span></em></strong><span class="style2"> On August 29th, 2005, a long-watched process in Massachusetts quietly slipped into its final phase.  On that date, the Information Technology Division (ITD) of the Commonwealth posted a new version of an information technology policy amendment on its Website, together with a statement that it would become final following a brief, eleven-day comment period.  No press release was issued, and the first widely noticed note of the event appeared as a <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/e8fc5cce-1a85-11da-b7f5-00000e2511c8.html"> two sentence posting</a> by Richard Waters, a <I>Financial Times</I> correspondent living in San Francisco, to the Financial Times Website.  The second sentence described Massachusetts, with its 6,349,097 inhabitants, as "one of the most populous states in the US." </span>
                  <p align="left"><span class="style2"> In this humble event some see the first victory of a revolution in government information technology (IT) policy that will spread throughout the world, seeking to liberate end-users from dependence on limiting proprietary solutions and the risk of abandonment, and guaranteeing that long term access to public documents will be assured.  Others fear that implementing the new policy will prove to be a disastrous adventure in IT utopianism, resulting from a process that perhaps advanced too quickly. </span>
                  <p align="left"><span class="style2"> What happens next in Massachusetts will be watched closely not just in the United States, but around the world as well, where government support for open source software supported by open standards is already much stronger.  Still, Massachusetts is the first government in the world to take the step that it did on September 21st, when it adopted the policy amendments referred to above: mandating compliance with a new file format rule that would preclude those subject to the policy from saving any document after January 1, 2007 in Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or any format of Microsoft or any other vendor that does not conform to OpenDocument 1.0, a standard newly adopted by OASIS, or as an Adobe PDF file. </span>
                  <p align="left"><span class="style2"> How this decision came about, and what the future holds, merits study from a variety of viewpoints:  Was the process by which the decision was made appropriate?  Were the criteria developed by Massachusetts optimal from a technical and practical view?  Was the proper balance between benefits and negative impacts found?   And most critically, will Massachusetts be successful in implementing the policy? </span>
                  <p align="left"><span class="style2"> The process by which the Commonwealth formulated the latest amendments to its IT policies provides a case study of the manner in which decisions are being made today on the cusp between the old world of proprietary systems, and a potential new open order of information and communications technology procurement.  The outcome of the decisions made by Massachusetts will therefore inform the actions of other governments considering similar departures from past policy, and may therefore accelerate, or impede, the making of such decisions. </span>

                  </div>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">A  near-final draft of this article has been reviewed for by representatives of  Microsoft, OASIS and ACT as to the accuracy of the respective statements and  the positions attributed to them.&nbsp;  [Disclosure: OASIS (the Organization for the Advancement of Structured  Information Standards) is a client of the author and his law firm.]</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><em><strong>A perennial question: </strong></em>Few definitions defy consensus in our modern  technology world as totally as the simple phrase &ldquo;open standards.&rdquo;&nbsp; Despite the insistence of some that one  definition should suffice for all purposes, it would be unnecessarily rigid and  counterproductive to impose a single definition upon all situations.&nbsp; For example, those that wish to create open  source software for release under any of the licenses <a href='http://www.opensource.org/licenses/'> approved by the Open Source Initiative</a> could not permit usage of  many of the licensing terms that would be required (and considered to be  unobjectionable) by the companies involved in creating many types of standards today,  or by the standards organizations within which such standards are being  developed.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">But definitions of  &ldquo;openness&rdquo; underlie increasingly important procurement requirements in the  public as well as the private sector.&nbsp;  And when substantial IT budgets are involved, the nuances of such  definitions inevitably become the subject of protracted and emotional  debate.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Historically, that debate  has been energized in part by the tension between what a vendor may gain from  adoption of a standard, and what it may be required to give up if it&rsquo;s  intellectual property would be infringed when that standard is implemented by  others.&nbsp; If a steady royalty stream can  be earned, such a result is highly desirable to many companies.&nbsp; In other cases, a patent owner is happy to  provide its intellectual property without cost, due to the other benefits that  it expects to receive, such as the rapid development of a new and profitable  market, or the increased opportunity to sell other products protected by  patents.&nbsp; But if a company enjoys a  dominant market share in a given product space, then no amount of royalties  would offset the loss occasioned by the broad adoption of a standard that could  destroy such a desirable market position.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Recently the degree of energy  invested in such debates has risen due to the increasing quality of open source  software, the development of which is enabling the acquisition of an ever-wider  range of products that are license fee-free (but hardly inexpensive, when all  costs of ownership are factored in), providing serious challenges to entrenched  vendors and new opportunities to other providers that have waited enviously on  the sidelines for many years</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><em><strong>Policy context: </strong></em>This year, all of these forces converged when  Massachusetts announced the latest changes to the Enterprise Technical  Reference Model (ETRM) that informs the decisions of the ITD, which in turn  controls the procurement decisions for the Executive Agencies of the  Commonwealth.&nbsp; The ETRM is a living  document, now instantiated in Version 3.5, as <a href=http://www.mass.gov/portal/index.jsp?pageID=itdsubtopic&L=4&L0=Home&L1=Policies,+Standards+&+Legal&L2=Open+Standards&L3=Enterprise+Technical+Reference+Model+-+Version+3.5&sid=Aitd>most recently updated </a>. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Without question, the most controversial section of the amended ETRM is titled <a href='http://www.mass.gov/portal/index.jsp?pageID=itdterminal&L=4&L0=Home&L1=Policies%2c+Standards+%26+Legal&L2=Open+Standards&L3=Enterprise+Technical+Reference+Model+-+Version+3.5&sid=Aitd&b=terminalcontent&f=policies_standards_ETRMVersion3.5InformationDomain&csid=Aitd'>"Information Domain&quot;</a>, and contains new rules relating to the forms in  which documents may be saved beginning January 1, 2007.&nbsp; Those rules will permit documents to be  archived using software that utilizes one of (at this time) only two formats  that are deemed to be sufficiently &ldquo;open&rdquo; to increase the likelihood that their  contents will be accessible over the long-term: <a href='http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/index.php#opendocumentv1.0'> OpenDocument for Office Applications 1.0</a>, a standard developed and maintained by OASIS, and the <a href='http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html'>Portable Document Format (PDF)</a>, which is owned, but freely licensed, by Adobe Systems Incorporated. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The decision to credential  Adobe PDF as well as OpenDocument is noteworthy, given that Microsoft Office is  not on the approved list, notwithstanding recent changes in policy and promises  regarding amendment of licensing terms that have been made by the Redmond  software developer, and the fact that Microsoft had earlier announced in no  uncertain terms that it had no intention of conforming its productivity suite to  the requirements of the OpenDocument format, regardless of the eventual policy  adopted by Massachusetts</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><em><strong>The history of OpenDocument: </strong></em>The format that would eventually become  OpenDocument is based upon an office suite that has experienced many years of  evolution and actual use.&nbsp; The original  code was developed by a German Company called StarDivision, which began  development of the product in 1994.&nbsp; In  August of 1999, Sun Microsystems purchased the code for US $73.5 million for  purposes of offering it&rsquo;s own office suite in competition with Microsoft.&nbsp; Initially, the suite (now called StarOffice  8.0) was sold as a commercial product, but in 2000 Sun contributed most of the  code to the newly organized <a href='http://www.openoffice.org/'>OpenOffice.org project</a>, to serve as the basis for an open source office suite.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Part of the vision for  OpenOffice.org from inception was to create an interoperable, vendor  independent and standardized file format for office applications. One key to  achieving this goal was the development of the OpenOffice.org XML file format  in an application-independent form, meaning that the same format could be used  by other vendors as the basis for their own product offerings. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">While the process of  achieving this goal was begun in OpenOffice.org, the primary focus of that  organization had been to produce and maintain a high-quality office suite.&nbsp; As a result, a group of interested companies  and others proposed the formation of a Technical Committee to standardize the  OpenOffice Format within OASIS, a software standards consortium whose rules and  process were deemed to be compatible with the creation of a standard based upon  an open source application.&nbsp; While OASIS  was a logical home for the project from a process point of view, standardizing  a file format for complete office suites was an ambitious undertaking, in  contrast to the computer-to-computer, transactional processes upon which OASIS  has historically focused.&nbsp; As a result  of this early transition, the majority of the format project was accomplished  within OASIS rather than OpenOffice.org.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">OASIS chartered what was  originally called the OpenOffice XML Format Technical Committee (TC) in  December of 2002.&nbsp; The original members  of the TC were nothing if not diverse: Arbortext, Boeing, Corel, CSW  Informatics, Drake Certivo, National Archive of Australia, New York State  Office of the Attorney General, Society of Biblical Literature, Sony, Stellent  and Sun Microsystems.&nbsp; Later, other  organizations joined the committee, including KOffice and IBM, each of which  has created its own office suite that supports OpenDocument.&nbsp; Some, but not all, of the suites that  support OpenDocument are based upon open source software developed by  OpenOffice.org, which continues to offer an open source office suite that is  committed to compliance with the OpenDocument OASIS Standard.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">With the transfer of rights  in the file formats to OASIS, the relationship between the OpenOffice.org code  and architecture and what is now called the OpenDocument format was reversed.&nbsp; Given the diverse composition of the OASIS  TC, the needs of end users, archivists and XML experts as well as vendors  interested in productizing the format were directly represented in the  development process, resulting in a balancing of interests that does not  naturally exist within the development process of a single vendor that is  strongly motivated by cost and time concerns as well as market  considerations.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The new TC did not simply  begin where OpenOffice.org left off, but instead spent more than a year  analyzing the existing format in detail in order to determine what to retain,  what to change, and what to add, thereby ensuring that the finally adopted  standard would be vendor neutral, application independent, and as interoperable  as possible.&nbsp; More than a year of  additional work was required to take the resulting format to a third and final  vote by the TC in March of 2005.&nbsp; The  draft standard was also posted for public review during the process, and the many  comments received from non-members were reviewed for merit and inclusion by the  TC.&nbsp; The resulting OpenDocument 1.0 was  approved by the full membership of OASIS two months later, becoming an OASIS  Standard in May of 2005.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Most recently, OpenDocument  1.0 was submitted by OASIS in September to the Joint Technical Committee of the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), a committee formed by the two &ldquo;Big Is&rdquo; to  create IT standards, and more simply known as ISO/IEC JTC 1.&nbsp;  Since OASIS is an international standard setting organization in its own  right, the submission was made using the ISO/IEC JTC 1 &ldquo;Publicly Available Specification&rdquo; (PAS) approval  process, rather than through a national member body of ISO/IEC JTC 1 (such  as ANSI, the American National Standards Institute).&nbsp; The PAS process was created specifically for such purposes, in  order to provide a fast-track approval option for globally adopted specifications that have been created through an  open, consensus-based process, but outside of an accredited software  development organization (ebXML, another OASIS Standard, was earlier approved  via a similar route and become ISO 15000).&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The TC that created  OpenDocument will continue to operate indefinitely, and remains open to new  voting and observer members.&nbsp; Currently,  it is at work on version 2.0, and its future work plans include both the  addition of new features and capabilities, as well as meeting needs of office  suite users as they continue to evolve.&nbsp;  According to Patrick Gannon, OASIS expects that the OpenDocument Format,  and products that conform to it, &ldquo;will be of particular interest to state and  federal governments, universities, research centers, and other large  international enterprises that (like Massachusetts) may have a diversity of  users working with different office client applications.&quot; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>The history of the  Massachusetts proposal:</em></strong>&nbsp;Massachusetts, like all  other states, has an extremely large and complex IT infrastructure that has  grown by accretion over many years.&nbsp; As  noted by Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got one of everything,&rdquo; leading  to enormous challenges of maintenance and support.&nbsp; In an effort to better manage this historical legacy and ensure  the greatest utility at the minimum cost to taxpayers, the ITD has developed a  number of policies and guidelines that are regularly updated as needs and  available solutions evolve over time.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving towards "Open Formats:&quot;</strong> As a part of this ongoing process, the ITD announced a brief <a href='http://www.mass.gov/portal/index.jsp?pageID=itdmodulechunk&L=3&L0=Home&L1=IT+Planning+%26+Finance&L2=IT+Investment+Planning+%26+Oversight&sid=Aitd&b=terminalcontent&f=_policies_standards_open_standards_policy&csid=Aitd'>Enterprise Open Standards Policy</a> on  January 13, 2004, based upon an earlier draft that had been released for  comment the preceding year.&nbsp; This final  version of the policy sought to resolve what some commentators had declared was  confusion on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s part in distinguishing open source software  from open standards.&nbsp; In part, the  policy reads as follows:</p>
                  <div align="left">

This  policy addresses the importance of open standards compliance for IT investments  in the Commonwealth. For the purpose of this policy, open standards is defined  as follows:<br>
                        <br>
                        <em>Open Standards</em>: Specifications for systems that are publicly available  and are developed by an open community and affirmed by a standards body.  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is an example of an open standard. Open  standards imply that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the  features and performance of their products. It also implies that the existing  information technology solution is portable and that it can be removed and  replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major  interruption (see current version of the Enterprise Technical Reference Model).</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The  ETRM, in turn, provides the detailed roadmap for carrying this policy into  action, and forms the cornerstone of Massachusetts&rsquo; concerted effort to  transform its IT infrastructure into a lower cost, more durable,  vendor-independent, cohesive platform for its operations</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">One year later, Kriss made a public statement titled <a href='http://www.mass.gov/eoaf/open_formats_comments.html'>Informal Comments on Open Formats</a>.  In these comments, he announced a new commitment to vendor-independent file formats, stating in part as follows:</p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
                  </div>
                  <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">We are now ready to extend the concept of Open Standards to  the next stage in an informal announcement today&hellip;.We will extend the definition  of Open Standards to include what we will be calling <em>Open Formats</em>.  Open Standards, as you know, are specifications for systems developed by an  open community and affirmed by a standards body. An example is XML, a method of  exchanging data.&nbsp; Open Formats are  specifications for data file formats based on an underlying open standard,  developed by an open community, and affirmed by a standards body; or <em>de  facto</em> format standards controlled by other entities that are fully  documented and available for public use under perpetual, royalty-free, and  nondiscriminatory terms. An example is TXT text and PDF document files.&nbsp;&nbsp; We plan to formally promulgate in February  2005 an additional list of approved Open Formats. &hellip;Why do we care about  formats? Electronic file formats sit at the core of concern about future access  to today's public records. Simply put, the question is whether, when we look  back a hundred years from now, we will be able to read the records of what we  did today. It should be reasonably  obvious for a lay person who reflects on the concept of public records that the  government must keep them independent and free forever. It is an overriding  imperative of the American democratic system that we cannot have our public  documents locked up in some kind of proprietary format, perhaps unreadable in the future, or  subject to a proprietary system license that restricts access.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">A  question of great interest to multiple constituencies thus arose:&nbsp; what would qualify as an open format for  purposes of future Massachusetts IT acquisitions?</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In  the same informal remarks, Secretary of Administration and Finance Kriss indicated that the OASIS OpenDocument format  would be a likely choice.&nbsp; He also  discussed ongoing discussions with Microsoft regarding certain licensing terms  that Massachusetts found to be inconsistent with its definition of open  standards, stating:</p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
                  </div>
                  <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">[Microsoft has] made  representations to us recently they are planning to modify that license, and we  believe, if they do so in the way that we understand that they have spoken  about (we will leave it obviously to them to describe exactly what they are  going to do), it is our expectation that the next iteration of the Open Format  standard will include some Microsoft proprietary formats. These formats, like  DOC files, will be deemed to be Open Formats because they will no longer have  restrictions on their use.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">According to Alan Yates, Microsoft believed that  the ITD later confirmed that the Microsoft XML Reference Schemas were  acceptable and would be included in the final list of permitted formats.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Public comments:</em></strong>&nbsp; During the nine months that followed, a public meeting and many private consultations were held between members of the ITD and representatives of technology companies, industry associations, and open source advocates, among others, culminating with the announcement on August 29th that a final decision would be made on the open format issue following a brief, eleven-day comment period.  Notwithstanding the short notice and window of opportunity, some 157 comments were received in letter or email form.  Some of the comments received were short (typically either very positive or very negative), while others were extremely detailed.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Five entities (Adobe Systems, Inc., Corel Corporation, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hiser + Adelstein ( a consulting firm))  provided comments in support of the proposed amendments that are <a href='http://www.mass.gov/portal/site/massgovportal/menuitem.769ad13bebd831c14db4a11030468a0c/?pageID=itdsubtopic&L=4&sid=Aitd&L0=Home&L1=Policies%2c+Standards+%26+Legal&L2=Open+Standards&L3=Open+Formats'> individually posted</a> at the ITD website.  The only negative comments that are separately  posted are those of Microsoft.&nbsp; A single  datafile includes all <a href='http://www.mass.gov/Aitd/docs/policies_standards/etrm3dot5/responses/allresponses.pdf'> 157 comment submissions,</a> including those that are  separately posted.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Of the total of 157  submissions, 97 are best classified as endorsements of the proposed amendments,  and 46 submissions are best classified as critical.&nbsp; The remaining 13 submissions are difficult to classify, since  they were offered solely to offer constructive comments, or included both  praise and criticism.&nbsp; Comments came  from a great diversity of individuals, including from the Communications  Officer of the United Nations (positive), from many states, and from as far a  field as Australia, England, Italy, Portugal, and Sweden (all positive).</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Of the negative comments,  seven are submissions by Massachusetts public officials, and six are brief,  identical form letters.&nbsp; The great  majority of the remaining negative submissions were sent by individuals that are  blind, or by representatives of organizations concerned with those with  disabilities.&nbsp; All of the submissions by  major corporations are positive, with the exception of the comment letter  received from Microsoft.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">13 of the submissions were  sent by various types of organizations: of these, three were sent by  organizations concerned with the rights of the blind (all negative), one by the  Massachusetts District Attorneys Association (negative), and two by public  policy associations (negative).&nbsp; Of the  seven letters submitted by technology trade associations, however, five were  laudatory (including all of the associations based in Massachusetts) and only  two were negative.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">A final opportunity to  comment and ask questions was provided at a meeting held on September 16 under  the auspices of the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">On  the evening of September 21, the ITD quietly posted the as-amended ETRM at its  website, together with a detailed Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) page that  addressed many of the questions that had been pressed most vigorously by  opponents of the draft policy.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong><em>Analyzing the results:</em></strong>&nbsp; Several factors contributed to the energy level, confusion and differences of opinion that have been expressed regarding the wisdom and propriety of the decision by the ITD.  First, the Commonwealth is entering into new territory, with a new standard to which additional functionalities will continue to be added.  Second, the high stakes for vendors, on the one hand, and the emotion of true believers in open standards and open source, on the other hand, have not been conducive to the most objective and precise expressions of belief.  And finally, the rapid end game events bracketed the Labor Day holiday weekend, therefore requiring rapid responses from commentators and the media alike. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As the dust begins to settle, it is important to make an objective assessment of the process followed by Massachusetts, and the prospects for success as it begins to implement its newly adopted plan of action.  The following is an attempt to begin that process, first, by addressing one company-unique issue that has been much bandied about in the press, and then by seeking to objectively present the views of both the supporters as well as the critics of the new policy. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The pursuit of antitrust prosecution by other means?</em></strong>&nbsp;  There has been much speculation that the commitment of Massachusetts to open source and open standards arises in part from the very public legal differences it has had with Microsoft in the past.  In 1998, Massachusetts was one of twenty states to join the U.S. Department of Justice in a massive and prolonged antitrust suit against Microsoft.  In 2001 the DOJ reached a settlement with Microsoft, in which most of the states joined, leaving Massachusetts as the only state objecting to the settlement and seeking stronger restrictions on Microsoft.  Ultimately, a federal appeals court rejected Massachusetts' challenge, and in June of 2004 approved the settlement earlier negotiated on its behalf by the DOJ.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">While such speculation has made for interesting news coverage and even more blog fodder, there appears to be no basis for any such link between the opinions of the Attorney General's office and those of Eric Kriss or Peter Quinn.  Each person interviewed in connection with this article (including Alan Yates of Microsoft and Peter Quinn of Massachusetts), regardless of their position on the proposal, firmly refused to give any credence to this speculation.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"> At the same time, it would be true to state that those involved in making the decisions on behalf of the Commonwealth are strongly committed to achieving permanent freedom from "lock in" to proprietary formats.  Or, in the novel words of Eric Kriss during the final public meeting held by the ITD on September 16, Massachusetts will not sacrifice its "sovereignty" over its IT infrastructure to any proprietary vendor.  As a result, while the new policy is not directed at Microsoft, it will be disproportionately felt by that vendor as a result of its dominant market share in office productivity software. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>The case for the  amendment:</em></strong>&nbsp; Unlike corporate end users and consumers, governments have long-term document retention obligations.  And while detailed rules provide that various types of information may be discarded after set periods of time in order to minimize the burden of retention, much information still remains that must be archived on a permanent basis.  Over the short course of the IT age, there have already been numerous market transitions in hardware and software, resulting each time in the need for difficult and expensive conversions of data, a trend that many government planners expect to extend into the indefinite future.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The ability to adopt standardized formats that would minimize the burden of indefinite retention is therefore extremely attractive to governments of all types, and would also facilitate the assembling of software and systems that could more easily share documents and data on a current basis.  If these formats are well maintained and are mandated by increasing numbers of customers, incentives will exist for multiple vendors to adopt them, resulting in broad product offerings that will drive down costs.  Best of all, if the formats are instantiated in open source software, acquisition costs (if not the significant support, maintenance and other costs of ownership that users of open source software still incur) will largely be eliminated, and the cost of competing proprietary versions of the same products should fall as well. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">While initial conversion to such a system would be painful, the hope would be that the pain would be a one-time event, in contrast to the prospect of ongoing conversions of equal difficulty as proprietary vendors make substantial changes to their own products or the collapse or acquisition of a vendor leads a customer to switch software entirely.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The result, post-conversion, would be the ability to maintain a lower cost, more interoperable IT infrastructure that is less susceptible to disruption and is immune over the long term from lock in by a single vendor and monopolistic price increases, and which is less at risk of abandonment as well. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>The case against the  amendment:</em></strong> &nbsp;Not surprisingly, Microsoft believes that the future would not be nearly so rosy.  But the President and Vice President of Public Affairs of ACT also argue persuasively that there can be significant risks to adoption of the new policy.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">From Microsoft's perspective, a primary question is why the concessions it offered to Massachusetts were deemed to be inadequate.  As pointed out in the <a href='http://www.mass.gov/Aitd/docs/policies_standards/etrm3dot5/responses/microsoft.pdf'>comment letter</a> submitted by Alan Yates, Microsoft announced on September 19, 2004 that it would include the source code of Office 2003 in its <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/sep04/09-19OfficeGSPPR.mspx'> Government Security Program</a>.  Under this program, qualifying government customers are able to gain access to both the source code for Office as well as the related XML Reference Schemas under terms of the Microsoft Government Shared License (Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server (TM) 2003, and Windows CE were already included in the program).  Other benefits of the program include opportunities to communicate directly with Microsoft staff regarding current and proposed software, and access to additional documentation and training opportunities. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Microsoft also included a variety of more subjective comments in its letter, questioning the financial benefits and practical problems of the new proposal, the robustness of the OpenDocument standard, the validity of permitting the use of Adobe PDF but not Microsoft Office, the potential for the policy to prevent Massachusetts from adopting new innovations, and whether undue burdens would be placed on Massachusetts residents and businesses.  Finally, Microsoft questioned whether the ITD had conformed with Massachusetts regulatory requirements involving notice, public comment, due process and internal procedures.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">ACT raised similar concerns in two comment letters, one dated <a href='http://www.actonline.org/documents/050910ETRMcomments2.pdf'> September 8, 2005</a>, and a second <a href='http://www.actonline.org/documents/050909ETRMcomments.pdf'>undated letter</a> that it delivered to Massachusetts, as well as additional criticisms relating to adverse impacts that it feared the policy could have on its small and mid-size business members.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Which is right?</em></strong>&nbsp; Given the variety of points raised by various constituencies, there is no single answer to this question.  Preliminary conclusions on most issues, however, can be reached on a point-by point-basis.  Of particular benefit in this regard is the Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) document that was placed at the ITD site simultaneous with the posting of the final version of the amended policy.  Many of the answers in that document provide additional details that may not have been unknown to various commentators, and other responses seem to indicate a retreat by the ITD from certain positions that it had earlier taken.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>How burdensome will the new policy be to state government?</em></strong>&nbsp; While conversion to the new policy will still represent a significant challenge, the FAQ includes one very important statement that appears to be new:  no conversion of existing documents is now contemplated &ndash; only documents created after the effective date of the policy (January 1, 2007) will be required to be saved in an approved format.  For the same reason, contentions (as in the Microsoft comment letter) that conversion will "significantly change countless legacy documents that are not fully supported by the newly designated format" will also not be a factor.  As clarified by the FAQ, it appears that the evolving plan is closer to a commitment that the Executive Agencies (only) will make archival copies of new documents using approved formats rather than a campaign to convert state government, and those doing business with the state, entirely to an OpenDocument environment.  This will still create burdens for the Executive Agencies, however, which will need to create documents in two formats (one for internal and one for external use), or convert at least some OpenDocument Format documents into other forms for transmission beyond the Executive Agencies.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>How burdensome will the new policy be to other Massachusetts  governmental entities?</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft contended in its letter that:</p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
                  </div>
                  <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">[T]here would be significant, and entirely unnecessary, costs incurred by all state agencies, departments, cities, counties, and school districts to procure new software applications that support the OpenDocument format for their individual users."</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">This statement is not accurate.  Only documents saved by the Executive Agencies of the Commonwealth must be in OpenDocument format.  According to Peter Quinn the day before the announcement of formal adoption of the policy, its implementation will be "invisible" to the citizens and other public officials of Massachusetts.  Presumably this means that although documents must be archived in the OpenDocument Format, they will be made available from Massachusetts websites in PDF or other formats that are already in common usage.  Similarly, the FAQ document makes it clear that no documents will need to be submitted to the Executive Agencies in OpenDocument Format.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Will existing proprietary format software need to be replaced?</em></strong>&nbsp; No.  Any Executive Agency employee may continue to use existing software (including Microsoft Office), provided that those document types that are currently supported by OpenDocument must be saved in that format, whether directly (if supported by the software in use) or through independent conversion, as would be necessary if the document was created using Microsoft Office.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Will limiting acquisitions to a single format stifle innovation?</em></strong>&nbsp; There are many ways to answer this question.  One is to reflect that Microsoft has never adopted a number of wonderful features that WordPerfect included in its products almost twenty years ago, such as the "show codes" feature and WordPerfect's remarkably easy macro creation keystroke sequence.  It is true that if increasing numbers of governments require OpenDocument Format compliance in their procurement of office productivity software, that this would tend to increase the focus of developers on developing compliant products.  To the extent that the OpenDocument Format imposes limitations on their design of such products (as all standards necessarily must do), this could be considered a limitation on innovation.   But it also may be agreed that competition is a powerful driver of innovation, and that limiting purchasing to the products of a single vendor that decides which features to offer can hardly be better than having a degree of enforced limitation on formats and allowing vendors to compete based on all other aspects of their compliant products.  And until such time (if ever) as OpenDocument Format supported office suites overwhelm the market, there will be more than ample incentive for those that serve on the OASIS OpenDocument TC to make that format as competitive as possible in the marketplace.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Does the policy limit Massachusetts to a single  proprietary format?</em></strong>&nbsp; This is the clearest example of efforts to  spread FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the marketplace by opponents of the  Massachusetts proposal.&nbsp; As earlier  noted, the OpenDocument Format is not only based upon a product that has been  in use in the marketplace for many years, but the OpenDocument Format is  already the foundation for several other existing products, both proprietary as  well as open source.&nbsp; Version 8.0 of  StarOffice, the original package from which the OpenDocument format evolved,  was released by Sun Microsystems on September 27, 2005 for use on the Windows,  Solaris and Linux platform.&nbsp; It is also  fully compliant with OpenDocument 1.0.   In its <a href='http://www.prnewswire.com/news/index_mail.shtml?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/09-27-2005/0004132410&EDATE='> press release</a>, Sun aggressively (and certainly not coincidentally) promotes the appropriateness of its product for those needing an OpenDocument alternative to Office: </p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
                  </div>
                  <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">StarOffice  software provides excellent compatibility with Microsoft Office. StarOffice 8  software further improves import and export of Word, Excel and PowerPoint  documents, even password-protected MS Word and MS Excel files and presentations  with complex animations, autoshapes and slide transitions. StarOffice 8  software also provides features that look more familiar to Microsoft Office  users. The Format Paintbrush allows simple transfer of styles from one section  of a document to another, and the Impress multi-pane user interface simplifies  creation of high-impact presentations.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Although StarOffice includes the oldest code and  is the first to claim full OpenDocument 1.0 compliance, it is hardly the only  alternative that will be available to the Executive Agencies well before the  conversion deadline.&nbsp; Other alternatives  include OpenOffice, IBM Workplace, and KOffice.&nbsp; Although as of this writing Corel has not made an announcement that it will  implement OpenDocument, it is a founding member of the OASIS TC and retains a  meaningful number of government users for its office suite.&nbsp; It also submitted a letter of strong support  to the ITD, and is assumed by some to have a compliant product under  development.<em> [Editor's Note: Corel later <a href='http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1864843,00.asp'>announced</a> that it will support OpenDocument, but did not announce a release date for a compliant version of WordPerfect Office.]</em></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Did the ITD violate Massachusetts regulations?</em></strong>&nbsp; The comment letters of both Microsoft and ACT review the provisions of a number of Massachusetts statues, regulations and administrative procedures in detail, questioning whether the ITD failed to follow required procedures in advancing the proposal.  Peter Quinn unequivocally denies that this was the case, stating that the Massachusetts process was extensively reviewed by legal counsel.  Among other reasons for concluding that compliance was not required, he stated that the changes to the ETRM do not constitute rule making subject to regulation.  However, he also stated that the ITD believed that public comment was useful and appropriate independent of statutory requirements, and that a decision had therefore been made to welcome public involvement on a less formal and regimented basis.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The comments of both  Microsoft and ACT are tentative on this point, either through lack of  conviction or perhaps due to the lack of public information available regarding  what the ITD may or may not have done by way of internal vetting of the  policy.&nbsp; Although more than twenty  months of open, public review of the policy amendments in their various drafts  were provided, as well as several face to face meetings, the specific formal  public notices mandated for some types of government action were not  provided.&nbsp; Compliance with other  formalities called for under other possibly applicable laws, such as  consultation with the Massachusetts Information Technology Advisory Board,  would have been less visible, and is therefore more difficult to evaluate.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Constraints of time and  space (not to mention the still limited amount of factual data) prevent a detailed  examination of these issues in this article.&nbsp;  Nor is it likely, absent a legal challenge, that these contentions will  ever be conclusively addressed.&nbsp;  However, further detail may be found in the FAQ on the internal vetting  process followed by the ITD, as well as answers to specific contentions  relating to procedural requirements.&nbsp;  It remains to be seen whether some of these responses (e.g., &ldquo;There is no legal requirement  that the ITD seek advice from the IT Advisory board on any IT initiatives  commenced in the Executive Department; rather, a legal requirement is imposed  on the Board to provide such advice to ITD&rdquo;) will satisfy others in government  that may be concerned with whether the ITD complied with  the spirit as well as the letter of the law.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Is the exclusion of Microsoft Office and the  inclusion of Adobe PDF arbitrary?</em></strong>&nbsp; This is perhaps one of the most difficult decisions by the ITD to reconcile.  It is certain that the Adobe format does not meet the ITD's own original definition of "open standards" as announced in its January 13, 2004 policy statement: "Specifications for systems that are publicly available and are developed by an open community and affirmed by a standards body."  In fact, Secretary Kriss had already backed away from this definition at an "Open Formats Summit" meeting with stakeholders held on June 9, 2005. The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/portal/site/massgovportal/menuitem.59254d74c0e831c14db4a11030468a0c/?pageID=itdterminal&L=4&L0=Home&L1=Policies%2c+Standards+%26+Legal&L2=Open+Standards&L3=Open+Formats&sid=Aitd&b=terminalcontent&f=_policies_standards_open_formats_summit_notes060925&csid=Aitd">brief public notes</a> of that meeting reflect apparent agreement that, "There is no one definition of the term "open"; rather, there is a continuum of openness."  While it is not possible in many cases to tell conclusively which statements in the notes of the meeting represent agreement and which are the record of opinions expressed by private sector attendees, the notes do conclude with three "Next Steps," one of which is to "Identify a continuum of acceptable open document standards for the Commonwealth."</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Once having agreed to back  off the original &ldquo;bright line&rdquo; definition that required adoption by a standards  body, it becomes more difficult to define and justify the dividing line between  what is, and what is not, acceptably &ldquo;open.&rdquo;&nbsp;  The FAQ answers the question as follows</p>
                  <div align="left">
                    <blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
                  </div>
                  <blockquote><p align="left" class="style2">While  the MS XML schema is licensed under a somewhat open patent license, its license  is not as open as Adobe&rsquo;s copyright license for PDF.&nbsp; Adobe&rsquo;s copyright license for the data structures, operators and  written specification constituting the interchange format called the Portable  Document Format or &ldquo;PDF&rdquo; imposes minimal legal restrictions on developers.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Suffice it to say that it  remains the prerogative of a customer to define the requirements for its  purchasing, and the ITD has decided that the dividing line lies somewhere  between Adobe PDF and Microsoft&rsquo;s XML Reference Schema for Office and the  licensing conditions related to their use.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But one cannot help feeling that the ITD would have benefited all  concerned had it been more explicit in the FAQ response quoted above (the  only guidance included in the FAQ document on this topic).&nbsp; Such a vague statement provides no assistance  to Microsoft in resolving the issue, or for other governments that may consider  adopting their own open format policies.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">At the end of the day, it  may be that the approval of the PDF format may have been based more on  pragmatism than on consistency in applying qualifying criteria:&nbsp; there are available implementations (both  open source and proprietary) that offer an alternative to most features of  Microsoft Office, but there is no &ldquo;more open&rdquo; alternative to the PDF format.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Will</em> <em>the benefits outweigh the challenges?</em></strong>&nbsp; The comments of ACT (both public and as conveyed during this author's telephone interview with ACT's President, Jonathan Zuck, and Vice President of Public Affairs, Morgan Reed) are worthy of careful consideration.  According to Jonathan Zuck, about 2/3's of its membership had an opinion on the Massachusetts proposal, and those with an opinion were mostly critical of the proposed amendments.  In the case of ACT members that are systems integrators and consultants, there was concern that their services would become less valuable if large segments of the marketplace were to narrow their purchasing options to a small number of products.  But there was also unhappiness over what members saw as a poorly vetted, aggressively pushed process that imposed broad-brush solutions that they believe would require "pounding square pegs into round holes."</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">More specifically, ACT  expressed concerns that traditional standards processes may not only be slower  than commercial development, but that the need to complete format upgrades  before development could begin would automatically lengthen the process of  innovation and implementation.&nbsp; Rather  than providing a platform for community innovation, they also stated that they  expect individual vendors will compete to add features to their product that  will ultimately defeat the initial goals of the policy.&nbsp; And they also pointed out a mirror image  concern:&nbsp; if Massachusetts needs a new  feature or change that is inconsistent with the existing OpenDocument format  and is unable to persuade OASIS to include that feature, what then?</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Zuck and Reed also believe  that the last-minute addition of language to the policy recognizing the needs  of disabled persons in response to the dozens of protests received on that  topic gives further evidence of undue speed and inadequate public review.&nbsp; Overall, they believe that Massachusetts  will have a very difficult time making the new policy work.&nbsp; At the same time, they also responded, when  asked, that they expect that Microsoft would in fact have little difficulty  adapting Office to support the OpenDocument format, notwithstanding its  protests that doing so would cause irresolvable backward compatibility  problems.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">One question that arises  from the FAQ is whether further analysis by the ITD may be leading it to trim  back the implementation of the new policy to the point where the benefits will  shrink even as the burdens merely shift, or even grow.&nbsp; As presented, only newly created Executive  Agency documents will be covered, and the FAQ recognizes that, &ldquo;Implementation  plans will take into account the need to maintain interoperability through the  use of a variety of acceptable formats.&rdquo;&nbsp;  In other words, OpenDocument will be used to achieve the core purpose of  creating a hopefully safer long-term archive, but it appears that the Executive  Agencies may be operating on the basis of redundant systems (and the continuing  need to pay software license fees on  any remaining software that does not  support the OpenDocument Format) for some time to come</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong><em>Conclusions:</em></strong>&nbsp;Not surprisingly, whether  Massachusetts has made an expensive mistake, or a brave, bold move that will  later be recognized as a turning point in public procurement, can only be  determined over time.&nbsp; The outcome of  that determination will depend less on the degree of difficulty that the ITD  encounters in making what it freely admits is a difficult transition than on  the future of the OpenDocument Format.&nbsp;  If those already offering or developing software based on that format  participate fully and forthrightly in ongoing OASIS development efforts, and if  systems integrators, independent software vendors and open source projects  embrace the opportunity to work with those that buy and sell such products,  then Massachusetts&rsquo; bet on breaking the lock-in cycle will be well rewarded.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The biggest variable in  whether this will occur is whether or not other governments will follow the  lead of Massachusetts and adopt the OpenDocument OASIS Standard.&nbsp; If they do, then it will be a customers&rsquo;  rather than a vendors&rsquo; game, and many of the concerns voiced by ACT will be  mooted by the self interest of the vendors themselves, leading each to compete  on services, features and quality for the largest share of the government  market possible.&nbsp; Similarly, if other  governments join in- the work of the OASIS OpenDocument Technical Committee, the future course of the OpenDocument Format will stay  closely attuned (as it is now) to government needs.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Either way, Massachusetts  will need to take a long view, and can expect that it will have a bumpy road  ahead in the short term.&nbsp; But someone  must lead the way, and every technology requires a first adopter.&nbsp; The commitment of the ITD and its leadership  must be applauded, given how easy it would be to maintain the status quo as one  more sheep in the herd, and how difficult it will be to blaze a trail into what  may prove to be a better future for all &ndash; but only if someone takes that first,  most difficult, step.</p>
