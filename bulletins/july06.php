                  <p align="center" class="style10">CERTIFICATION AND YOU<br>
                  </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">If you're reading this issue  on line, there's a fair chance that you're viewing it on the screen of a WiFi  enabled laptop.&nbsp; And as someone that is  interested in standards, I expect that you're well aware that WiFi is a standard.&nbsp; But you might not know that the chipset that  your laptop is using to access your wireless router (or Starbuck's, as the case  may be) has almost certainly been certified by the <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/">WiFi Alliance</a>, even though this fact is what  underlies your assumption that you will be able to log on to another router  almost everywhere you go.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">The process of certification  &ndash; testing and verifying compliance to a standard - is vital to the credibility  and utility of standards, although we are typically not aware of how pervasive  such programs in fact are.&nbsp; As a simple  proof of that observation, glance at the bottom of your laptop's power source,  or at the label on the bottom of the laptop itself, and you will find a  scattershot pattern of small and inscrutable seals &ndash; each of which is the  safety-related certification mark of a separate testing body (I count 21 on my  Dell power source).</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Our topic this month,  appropriately enough, is therefore the important and perhaps underappreciated role  that certification, and the process of building brand awareness in some  certification programs, plays in the world of standards.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong> for July, I introduce the topic by highlighting both the breadth as well as the  adaptability of standards and certification programs, as well as the important  role that these tools are playing in addressing new and intimidating  environmental challenges, such as global warming and ensuring the sustainable  use of natural resources.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In this month's <strong><em>Feature  Article</em></strong>, I provide an overview of the techniques and role of  certification and branding in the information and communications technology  (ICT) sector, an area in which sufficient resources to create robust third  party administered testing tools has often been lacking, requiring the creation  of a spectrum of techniques that are not common in many other industry sectors.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As the <strong><em>Standards Blog </em></strong>entry  for this month, I've selected a posting on a topic that I have covered in great  detail for a year now: the expanding adoption of the OpenDocument Format (ODF)  and the adaptation of the marketplace to a multiple document format  environment.&nbsp; This entry focuses on an  initiative announced by Microsoft early this month to fund and support the  creation of a converter to facilitate the translation of documents created  using its own format into documents that can be opened using ODF compliant  software.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">My <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> essay returns to the certification theme, contrasting the adoption of a  standardized, certified product family &ndash; WiFi enabled devices and routers &ndash;  with another popular but proprietary high tech offering: the Apple iPod and  iTunes environment.&nbsp; Each of these  successful systems has generated a &quot;lifestyle&quot; impact, but the open  standards based wireless lifestyle that is supported by the ingenuity (and  marketing budgets) of hundreds of companies is exploding at an order of  magnitude greater rate than its proprietary analogue in the music world.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As usual, the issue ends  with <em><strong>The Rest of the News</strong></em>, being a selection of what I thought  were the most interesting and important stories of the last month, accompanied  by a few observations on why I found them to be of interest. </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">A final note:&nbsp; The <strong><em>CSB</em></strong> is issued ten times a  year, with August and December being my months to catch my breath, and spend  some time on other interests.&nbsp; As a  result, I'll visit with you next in September.</p>
                  <div align="left" class="style2">As  always, I hope you enjoy this issue.&nbsp;</div>

              <p align="center" class="style10"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></strong></font><br>
              </p>
              
                <p align="left" class="style2">The  practice of certifying compliance with standards is almost as old as the  creation of standards themselves.&nbsp; This  should come as no surprise, because the vast majority of standards are created  for the benefit of multiple stakeholders, rather than as pure design tools for  vendors.&nbsp; Human nature (on both sides of  a transaction) being what it is, there is no reason for a vendor to expect a  customer to believe an uncorroborated assertion of compliance.&nbsp; But third party certification can provide a  means to fill this gap in trust.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In  consequence, the testing and certification of compliance with all manner of  requirements, both mandatory under laws and voluntary under many thousands of  consensus-based standards, has been an ever-expanding and adaptable practice  since the nineteenth century.&nbsp; The  result is that we enjoy a world today that is more commercially trustworthy  than that which existed only a short time ago.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">It is  interesting to note in this regard that an increasing number of the  certifications that benefit us today fall into the voluntary rather than the  mandatory category.&nbsp; True, compliance  with thousands upon thousands of health and safety-related standards has been  incorporated into governmental regulations.&nbsp;  And those regulations continue to be policed by armies of local building  inspectors and federal employees of agencies such as the U.S. FDA and  OSHA.&nbsp; But there are even more thousands  of standards that vendors, service providers and professionals voluntarily  comply with in order to increase the commercial attractiveness of their goods  and services.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Why  should vendors and service providers not only constrain their design freedom  and professional conduct to standards, but also pay others to confirm such  compliance?&nbsp; The exact reasons vary, but  most come down to assuring consumers that their purchasing expectations will be  met, and/or that those expectations may be justifiably higher with respect to  certified than non-certified alternatives.&nbsp;  In practice, these expectations can relate to interoperability (yes,  this will plug and play with that), safety (I see the Underwriters Laboratory  seal), training, professionalism and trustworthiness (professional  certifications of all types) and compliance with ethical, environmental or  other societal values (this vendor engages in fair practices, both at home and  abroad).</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">The mere  existence of certification programs arguably raises the bar even for those that  do not choose to participate.&nbsp; The  reason is that consumer expectations can rise in response to the promotional  campaigns that are often launched to support a certification program.&nbsp; If the consumer comes to associate value  with certified product or service, all competitors are put to the challenge of  justifying the value proposition of their own offerings, either through lower  prices, providing superior service, or simply by committing to a larger  marketing budget.&nbsp; Ultimately, it may  become a less expensive and more certain alternative for a non-participating  vendor to simply meet the same tests that those who certify have met, rather  than to seek to persuade the buying public that an unknown quantity provides a  superior alternative &ndash; especially if the certified product is now commanding a  premium price.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Such  market-based self-regulation can provide a very attractive alternative to  government regulation, avoiding the greater bureaucracy, waste, and expense  that might otherwise be brought to bear to address the same issues.&nbsp; Even assuming parity of process and  efficiency in public and private endeavors, it is difficult to imagine the  degree to which government payrolls would need to expand, were the public  sector to assume responsibility for assuring compliance with the hundreds of  thousands of voluntary consensus standards in existence today.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Recently,  broad awareness of the threats presented by global warming and dependency on  foreign energy sources has risen dramatically in many countries (including,  finally, even the United States).&nbsp; But  the political will to address these challenges effectively is still often weak  (especially in the United States), despite the fact that public opinion is  swinging in favor of responsible action.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">In the  face of growing consumer interest in environmentally and ethically responsible  conduct by industry, a variety of private sector organizations have been  launched.&nbsp; Such private sector  initiatives can be more nimble and responsive, and less likely to be subverted  by special interests, than efforts to achieve the same ends through the  legislative process.&nbsp; This has proven to  be true not only in the case of initiatives launched by &quot;green&quot;  advocates, but also by major companies in some extractive industries that have  (in the words of the author Jared Diamond) grown concerned that their  &quot;social license&quot; to operate may be revoked if they do not (literally)  clean up their acts.&nbsp; </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">Some of  the efforts that are in process now have adapted traditional standard setting  and certification concepts to address important new global needs.&nbsp; A splendid example (and there are others) is  the Forest Stewardship Council, which is headquartered in Germany, and has  offices in over 40 nations.&nbsp; This  organization has created rigorous standards for sustainable harvesting of  timberland, and certifies independent inspection companies that forest owners  can hire to assess their compliance in the field to FSC standards.&nbsp; Only after compliance with these standards  has been confirmed can the FSC certification mark be applied to raw lumber, and  to those finished goods created from materials that can be tracked back through  the supply chain to a certified source.&nbsp;  Certified timberlands remain subject to annual, unannounced inspections  to assure continuing compliance &ndash; all at the cost of those for profit, not for  profit, and governmental forest owners that seek certification.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">The  validity, value and extensibility of the concept of standards are amply  demonstrated by such new and innovative efforts.&nbsp; Today, we are faced with ever more daunting challenges, such as  global warming, dwindling natural resources and an increasingly ravaged  environment.&nbsp; If there is any reason to  hope that we will be able to cope with these crises, it may lie in our ability  to create such new kinds of voluntary consensus standards &ndash; and in the  deployment of effective certification programs to back them up.</p>

              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Introduction: </em></strong>Standards  have value to many constituencies, but their most obvious beneficiaries are  those that utilize standards in the production of goods and the delivery of  services, and those that consume those deliverables.&nbsp; While vendors often benefit from using standards simply as  production tools (e.g., to achieve interoperability between products from the  same vendor), the greatest value of a standard to vendors and consumers alike  can arise from simply knowing that a product or service complies with a  standard.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">For  example, performance standards (e.g., how many watts of energy a light bulb  will draw, and how many lumens of light it will produce) permit vendors to  provide products that customers can easily evaluate, and allow customers to  compare prices between competing products.&nbsp;  Similarly, vendors increasingly adopt and implement interoperability  standards that allow their products to access networks of all types in order to  make those products more useful and desirable, and customers rely on built-in  &quot;plug and play&quot; interoperability in order to mix and match components  of everything from music systems to home wireless networks.</p>
              <p class="style2">                In  order for such benefits to exist, however, customers need to be able to rely  on, and therefore trust, the fact that a product that purports to comply with a  standard actually does.&nbsp; Such trust can  be based upon any of a number of means, including vendor assertions, if the  vendor has earned a reputation for trustworthiness, or on third party testing  and confirmation of compliance.&nbsp; With  respect to that subset of standards that is created by governments (laws and  regulations), the assurance of compliance may result from government  inspections, licensures and enforcement.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Private  sector assertions of compliance are often loosely referred to as  &quot;certification,&quot; in the sense that someone (whether the vendor or a  third party) is promising that the good or service complies with the standard.&nbsp; More properly, the word  &quot;certification&quot; is usually used only where a neutral third party is  providing the assurance of conformance.&nbsp;  Regardless of who is making the guarantee, however, the value is roughly  the same, if the claim of compliance is accepted and relied upon in the  marketplace.</p>
              <p class="style2">                That  value can be augmented by focusing customer attention on the benefits of  purchasing products that comply with a standard.&nbsp; Such building of &quot;brand awareness&quot; in a standard can be  just as useful as building customer awareness of an individual vendor's  trademarked products.&nbsp; Moreover, the  costs of building brand awareness in a standard can be shared among many  vendors, thus lowering the per-vendor cost of a promotional campaign by  leveraging the efforts of the many campaign participants.</p>
              <p class="style2">                In  this article, I will survey the principal means by which information and  communications technology (ICT) industry compliance testing tools are created,  the most common types of programs employed to perform and certify successful  passage of compliance tests, and the ways that vendors build compliance brand  awareness through the promotion of certification programs.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>I.&nbsp; Overview</strong></p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Why test for compliance?</em></strong>&nbsp;  As with so many other aspects of standards and standard setting, the  concept and practice of certification extends back into the dim reaches of  antiquity. The first known examples of certification relate to weights and  measures, as evidenced by metal ingots stamped with royal seals that attest to  purity and weight. The evolution of coinage systems in many societies was a  manifestation of the same certification concept, using the impressed (and  sometimes idealized) likeness of a ruler on each coin to attest to the exact  value (also sometimes idealized) of the precious metal comprising the coin.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Certification  of compliance with standards relating to safety, on the other hand, has roots  in the private as well as the public sector.&nbsp;  For example, the development of standards to ensure the safe design and  building of steam boilers arose not from a government effort to prevent boiler  explosions, but from a private vendor initiative launched to reassure both the  public as well as insurance underwriters that installing boilers would not lead  to disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; But over time government  regulators became pleased to incorporate by reference the fruits of such  private initiatives into the regulations they create in an effort to maintain  public safety.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">By  1984, for example, voluntary compliance standards created by the American  Association of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to ensure that heat sources would  automatically shut down before boilers could run dry (and sometimes explode)  had been adopted into law by 46 states and all ten Canadian provinces. <a href="#1">1</a> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the private sector, the ubiquitous  Underwriters Laboratories &quot;UL in a circle&quot; mark (and its many related  marks) is well recognized by U.S. consumers as a trusted indication that  products bearing the mark have been designed to criteria that the UL believes  to be conducive to safe usage. <a href="#2">2</a> <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""> </a></p>
              <p class="style2">                In  more recent years, certifications of all types have become omnipresent &ndash;  attesting to the weight, quality, purity, safety and other significant  attributes of goods as diverse as building materials, drugs, foods, appliances,  elevators, services of all types, and more recently, advanced technology  products and sustainable forest management. These certifications attest to  compliance with the standards promulgated by a wide variety of bodies &ndash;  Federal, State, and more recently, regional (e.g., the European Union)  governments and agencies, safety testing organizations, accredited private  sector standard setting organizations, and unaccredited consortia, trade  associations, environmental foundations, and other fora. Within some of these  broad categories there may be hundreds of individual standard setting bodies,  some of which develop and maintain many, and even thousands, of standards. One  site, <a href="http://www.nssn.org/" target="_new">http://www.nssn.org</a>,  tracks the status of some 270,000 current standards worldwide.<br>
                              <br>
                Standards themselves can be of several types, permitting varying ways to  comply, as well as different processes to verify compliance.&nbsp; For example, <strong><em>performance </em></strong>standards  define required outcomes, but not the design elements required to achieve those  outcomes.&nbsp; As a result, they permit a  vendor to design a product using a variety of techniques (patented and  otherwise), so long as the resulting product meets the established performance  measures.&nbsp; The techniques used to  certify compliance with such products must therefore accommodate the different  types of products designs so utilized.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Products  built to <strong><em>design</em></strong> standards, on the other hand, must conform to  more detailed and exacting specifications, so that all electrical plugs of a  given type (for example) will fit into all electrical sockets intended to  accommodate them. Compliance testing techniques for this type of standard can  therefore be as simple as measurements of physical dimensions.&nbsp; A given standard can incorporate both  performance and design elements as well as diverse criteria, including the  composition of component materials, physical dimensions, minimum outputs and  maximum tolerances.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Interoperability</em></strong> standards, from the compliance testing point of  view, can be another type of amalgam, in that design elements are specified,  but their compliance (as in software) may need to be inferred from performance  tests that prove or disprove success in achieving compliance. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Why brand?&nbsp; </em></strong>Compliance  testing of products is very widely used by vendors to ensure that their  products will perform as expected, will meet regulatory requirements, and/or  will be safe to use.&nbsp; Certification of  compliance also bears an important role in international trade, where the  importation of products may be preconditioned on proof of compliance with applicable  standards. <a href="#3">3</a> <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""> </a>&nbsp; This extra effort taken to demonstrate  compliance with standards is usually invisible and unknown to purchasers, or  taken for granted by consumers in the case of safety standards in  well-regulated societies.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                The  reason that vendors do not go to greater lengths to publicize their efforts to  achieve compliance or formal certification is because the means required are  expensive, and compliance may not be sufficiently important to a consumer to  warrant the extra marketing and promotional resources required to raise  customer awareness.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Competitive formats:</em></strong>&nbsp; In today's interconnected world, however,  there is increasing demand for certification mechanisms that can assure  consumers as well as vendors that their expectations will be met when they make  a purchase, whether they are aware that that expectation relates to a standard  or not.&nbsp; Visible evidence of such  certification can be useful in the consumer realm to convey the message that a  product will perform and be usable as desired.&nbsp;  This is particularly true where new products are being introduced that  rely on interoperability to provide value, and where consumers are aware that  multiple, incompatible types of products are being sold that are visually  indistinguishable, but for a distinctive logo or label text.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                In  the late 1970s and early 1980s, for example, it was essential for video vendors  to indicate, and for buyers and renters of videotapes to carefully look for the  label stating, whether a given title conformed to the VHS or the Betamax video  format.&nbsp; The same is true today as the  next generation of DVD players and discs is now being introduced into the  marketplace.&nbsp; Just as before, two  competing (and incompatible) formats are once again being promoted, one called  HD-DVD, and the second Blu-Ray.&nbsp;  Initially, the vendors of each camp will seek to persuade consumers that  their technology is superior, and to build brand awareness around their format  mark. <a href="#4">4</a> <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""> </a>&nbsp; After a given consumer buys a player that  conforms with one format or the other, however, the principal value of the  format label will not be as a brand, but as a conformance mark on a DVD, in  order to allow the consumer to avoid buying or renting a disc that proves to be  unreadable on the particular player she now owns.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New networks:</em></strong>&nbsp; Other common examples of such visible certifications, promoted as  actual brands but of value to consumers for more utilitarian means, include the  logos that appear on ATM machines, informing a user whether a given terminal  will accept a credit, debit or bank card from the network (e.g., Star or  Cirrus) with which that card is registered.&nbsp;  Today, most bank ATMs are compatible with the cards of a wide variety of  issuers, and arrangements have been made between banks and those issuers to  reconcile accounts behind the scenes for most customers.&nbsp; But initially, these networks were more  limited, and the marks displayed on cash machines therefore had a higher value  to individuals on the lookout for an ATM that could satisfy their need for  instant liquidity. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Whether  or not branding as well as certification makes sense to vendors and service  providers - and to what degree &ndash; therefore depends on market circumstances. In  the ATM example, there is no tolerance for error, because the results are  binary: either the card can or can't be read, from the technical perspective,  and the transaction will or will not be accepted, at the commercial level.&nbsp; When someone sees a Cirrus logo on an ATM,  they expect their card to be honored, even if the user has no knowledge what  the &quot;Cirrus&quot; network is, who designed it, or how it operates.&nbsp; The value that the consumer does appreciate  is that there are hundreds of thousands of ATMs worldwide that bear the Cirrus  logo, and into which the holder of (for example) a MasterCard can insert that card  in order to obtain cash. </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Vendor needs:</em></strong>&nbsp; In the world of non-consumer goods, the standards-based goals of  commercial vendors may vary widely. In some circumstances, standards and  credible certification mechanisms may make it easier for a new market to develop  because one vendor will have a greater degree of confidence that the products  reaching the marketplace will indeed be interoperable. Similarly, the existence  of certification options may make it more worth a vendor's while to create  products that comply with one standard rather than another, not only because  the certification option has independent value, but because it knows that other  vendors will be more likely to choose the standard supported by  certification.&nbsp; Since a standard only  becomes useful through wide adoption, implementing the standard supported by  certification therefore becomes the safer, as well as the higher value,  decision (all other things being equal).</p>
              <p class="style2">                In  this type of case, there is no incentive to create public brand awareness at  all.&nbsp; Instead, a much more targeted, but  no less important, campaign is needed to educate the vendors in a given product  space that not only a standard, but a supporting certification mechanism is  available to reward them for adoption.&nbsp;  In many cases, the existence of compliance tests, even without a formal  certification program, will still be attractive, because the compliance tests  will be useful as tools to assist a vendor in discovering those changes in its  product design that are required to achieve compatibility.</p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Product identification:</em></strong>&nbsp; The value of certification and branding can  also fall somewhere in between.&nbsp; This is  because standards &quot;brand awareness&quot; is more common than most  consumers might suspect, with much of the public being unaware that a heavily  promoted brand utilized by multiple vendors actually relates to a  standard.&nbsp; A current example is the  explosive use of &quot;WiFi&quot; enabled equipment, from laptops to home  network routers, all of which achieve their unique value through compliance  with one or more of the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless connectivity  standards.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                In  this case, the WiFi Alliance, an unaccredited consortium, acts as an auxiliary  to IEEE, an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited, global  standards development organization (SDO).&nbsp;  The WiMedia Alliance rapidly creates test suites for each WiFi standard  as it is completed, and then offers certification testing to permit vendors to  refine their designs to achieve interoperability, and then advertise their  compliance through use of WiFi trademarks licensed from the Alliance after  their products pass the required tests. </p>
              <p class="style2">                The  result is akin to the &quot;Intel Inside&quot; branding campaign, but with  important differences.&nbsp; In the Intel  case, Intel customers are able to borrow on the reputation of the best-known  semiconductor manufacturer, and Intel benefits from the increased advertising &ndash;  but Intel remains in sole control of the design of its chips, and the use and  ownership of the &quot;Intel Inside&quot; trademark.&nbsp; With WiFi, the 250 members of the WiMedia Alliance control the  process of test suite creation, certification testing and brand promotion.&nbsp; To the customer, however, the result is much  the same: greater assurance that expectations will be satisfied when a purchase  is made.&nbsp; Even if they don't really know  why. <br>
                              <br>
                              <strong>II &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification Processes</strong> </p>
              <p class="style2">                Except  in certain government-regulated areas where determination of compliance must be  confirmed on-site (e.g., in the case of building codes and food preparation),  certification tests and test facilities must usually be created by the private  sector, either under the auspices of an existing standards development  organization, by for-profit companies, or by means of a new entity created for  a specific purpose. </p>
              <p class="style2">                In  recent decades, more and more ITC standards have been created not by accredited  standards development organizations (SDOs), but by unaccredited consortia.&nbsp; However, while a standard setting  organization (SSO) of either type may be quite able to fund and manage the  development of a standard, SSOs in general, and consortia in particular, are  most frequently low-budget operations. Moreover, in the world of SDOs, there is  a history of separation between the standards creation process and the  compliance testing function, each of which is conducted by a separate  organization.</p>
              <p class="style2">                This  can lead to a lack of certification options, especially in the information  technology (IT) industry, which is typified not only by expensive research and  development costs, but also by briefer product lifespans than is common in many  other industries.&nbsp; Because development  of a robust test suite implemented in software (as compared to a set of  detailed questions attesting to internal design compliance and self-testing)  can be quite expensive, that cost is likely to exceed the financial resources  of the organization that has created the standard in question, even though the  actual process of certification testing might be self-funding once the test  itself has been developed.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Because  the number of vendors building products to a given standard may be low relative  to the cost of creating a test suite to confirm compliance, it is also usually  the case that a private testing service would be unable to recover its  development costs to create the test suite needed before it could offer  certification services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently,  where robust test suites are developed at all, they are often funded by  consortium dues or by a government or other grant, or the test suite is  developed and contributed by the same member that initiated the creation of the  standard to which the test suite relates.</p>
              <p class="style2">                The  same challenges that stand in the way of test suite creation also arise in the  context of certification testing.&nbsp; In  the case of actual interoperability or software-driven testing, expensive test  equipment, facilities and personnel may be required, as well as administrative  support.&nbsp; Once again, such costs exceed  the budgets, staff and physical resources of many SSOs.&nbsp; On occasion, however, a third party can be  found to provide testing services once the development of the test suite itself  has been funded or arranged through the consortium's own devices of one type or  another.</p>
              <p class="style2">                As  a result of the financial challenges of instituting a formal third-party  certification testing program, compliance programs and processes are therefore  far from uniform.&nbsp; Certification  programs in the ITC space have therefore evolved that fall across a range of  increasing cost and credibility, ranging from very low-budget self-assertion  (and therefore low trust) programs, to costly third-party programs that may  provide much higher credibility and value.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>One on one systems:</em></strong>&nbsp;  The following are representative (although not exhaustive) of the levels  of compliance testing and certification that can be found in the ITC industry today  where the parties to the process are the vendor and the SSO or a third party  verifier.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Self-Assertion without a Test Suite: </em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>At the most modest end of the  scale is <strong><em>self-assertion</em></strong>, which is not a certification process at  all, in any true sense of the word. In this model, the vendor simply asserts  that its product conforms to a given standard, and there is no third party  verification of either the result, or the means by which the vendor reaches its  conclusion. Where this is the best that can be done, it is important for a  consortium to make it clear that only limited credibility should be given to  such assertions, and that the marketplace understands that no formal  certification process is in place. </p>
              <p class="style2">                As  a result, the term &quot;certification&quot; should not be used in connection  with a self-assertion program. Rather, the implementers of standards in this  setting should only be permitted to assert &quot;compliance with&quot;, or  &quot;conformance to,&quot; a standard or specification. <a href="#5">5</a> <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""> </a> Self-assertion programs are quite common for primarily informational purposes,  notwithstanding the limited level of credibility that they are likely to  offer.&nbsp; One reason is that, unlike  safety features in consumer safety products, interoperability failures in ICT  products do not typically lead to dire consequences, and the government  therefore has not to date found it necessary to focus on this area.&nbsp; Further, vendors can acquire an individual  reputation over time for being trusted (or not) when they self-assert compliance,  since customers will swiftly learn whether or not the product in question is  truly interoperable with other equipment or software believed to comply with  the same standard.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Second,  a wide range of factors (besides cost) may preclude the ability or interest of  an SSO to create a test suite and/or engage a third party testing service.&nbsp; For example, the commercial value of  compliance may not be high enough, or the standard itself may not be  sufficiently robust enough to achieve a conclusive result, and therefore  compliance with the standard alone would not imply a result that has  significant public commercial value.&nbsp;  Where cost is the true reason, however, the achievements of the affected  organization may be more modest than those of another group that is capable of  supporting a full certification program, especially where reliable  interoperability is highly important to the end user. </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Self-Asserted Compliance (or Self-Certification):</em></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>In this model, some type of test  suite exists (although it may be a &quot;paper test&quot; that states required  results of one sort or another), but the vendor performs the test itself and  asserts success. In some cases, there may be little effort to publicize the  fact that a product meets the test, because the test suite has been created  primarily as a tool for vendors to use in order to achieve interoperability or  another goal at a lower cost. In other cases, credibility is an important goal,  but the consortium has not been motivated, or able, to arrange for  verification.&nbsp; As a result, only a very  modest increase in trust may be gained over self-assertion of compliance, since  only one leg (thoroughness or rigor of test) has been strengthened, but not the  other (independent verification). </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Self-Certification with Verification:</em></strong>&nbsp; If a higher degree of credibility for the certification  program is deemed to be desirable, the vendor is required to return some type  of evidence of satisfactory test completion to the SSO (or a third party) for  verification.&nbsp; The deliverable typically  will be a paper or electronic record of the test results, with the credibility  of the program relying in part on how stringent and conclusive the test suite  provided may be.&nbsp; Again, depending on  the consortium's resources and the degree to which vendors are willing to pay  certification fees, the report may either simply be filed away to create what  is essentially a record of self-assertion, or may be examined for completeness  and consistency, but not otherwise directly confirmed by an independent test of  the product.&nbsp; Hence, an element of  unsupported trust is still involved, and the credibility of the certification  is therefore still qualified. </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Third Party Testing:</em></strong><strong> </strong>&nbsp;This is the highest standard of formal  testing, since the vendor must submit its product to a third party for  testing.&nbsp; However, the efficacy of  testing may vary widely, being limited in part by the sophistication of the  standard to which the test applies (some standards are very detailed and  comprehensive, while others are less so), and the effectiveness of the test  itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, a product built to one  standard which successfully passes certification testing may indeed &quot;plug  and play&quot; with another compliant product, while a product built to  another, less comprehensive standard may require further refinements in order  to reliably interoperate.&nbsp; The degree to  which a standard is capable enabling full interoperability is also affected by  factors other than technical challenges, including political compromises (such  as permitting alternate ways to implement a single element of a standard) among  members that are, after all, usually competitors. </p>
              <p class="style2">                With  third party testing, the final results are often submitted to the SSO, which  will then issue the actual certification, along with a license to use its  trademarks in connection with assertions of satisfactorily passing a  certification test. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Other Processes:</em></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>There are other mechanisms besides certification testing  that a consortium may take to increase the credibility of its standards and/or  assist its members and other companies in achieving a high degree of  compliance. </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Interoperability Testing:</em></strong>&nbsp; In some cases, a third party testing service  may be engaged to run submitted products directly against other compliant  products, in addition to (or instead of) running them against the test suite.  In others, a consortium may set up such an &quot;interoperability center&quot;  itself (usually at a member site or at a trade show) to which members may (or  in some cases are required to) bring their hardware and software products and  run them against each other, in order to work out final interoperability issues  not able to be resolved by means of a test suite. </p>
              <p class="style2">                The  purpose of such testing can be either very secret or very public.&nbsp; In the former case, stringent  confidentiality agreements may be utilized, particularly where the testing  being conducted relates to products that are not yet announced in the  marketplace, and/or where the failure of a product to demonstrate  interoperability could have a negative impact on sales.&nbsp; In this case, the purpose of the exercise is  all about compliance confirmation and not at all about branding.</p>
              <p class="style2">                At  the opposite extreme is the very much public &quot;plug fest&quot; at a trade  show, where multiple vendors demonstrate the interoperability of their  products.&nbsp; In this case, the purpose is  entirely brand-related, since no vendor would wish to publicly demonstrate the  non-compliance of its products, and confirmation of interoperability is usually  therefore tested in advance.</p>
              <p class="style2">                In  each case, although the activity in question may not be part of the formal  certification testing process, it provides another example of the way in which  an SSO may initiate and coordinate activities in order to lower costs and  improve outcomes for its members in support of the standard that it has  developed. </p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Reference Software: </em></strong>In some cases,  an SSO will provide actual software instantiating a specification. The software  is often made available in both source code as well as object code form, and is  commonly referred to as a reference implementation.&nbsp; Where such software is available (sometimes only to members, and  at others as a free download from the consortium's website), an implementer is  spared the expense of developing its code to comply with the standard. </p>
              <p class="style2">                One  common reason for the existence and use of reference software is that a member  may have already created it for its own purposes, and is willing to make it  freely available to all in order to reap some greater benefit from wide  adoption of the standard.&nbsp; Another  reason may be that a standard has been created in a patent-rich environment,  and there is a common benefit to be gained from the availability of an  implementation of the standard that is not believed to infringe upon known  intellectual property rights of (at least) members.&nbsp; While the primary motivation may therefore not be to save  compliance testing time and expense, those indirect benefits automatically  follow. <br>
                              <br>
                              <strong>III. Trademarks and Branding</strong><br>
                While  discussing intellectual property concerns in standard setting almost always  focus on patent and copyright issues, trademarks play an essential role as  well.&nbsp; The reason is that while patent  law may control what can be in a standard, and copyright law protects the text  of the standard itself, only trademark law provides the means to control whether  or not a vendor is entitled to claim that its products actually comply with a  standard. <a href="#6">6</a> <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""> </a> </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Using Trademarks to Enforce Quality Control:</em></strong> As noted  earlier, standards need to be credible in order to have value.&nbsp; This is because standards are only useful to  a customer to motivate a purchase, or to a vendor to secure market advantage,  when the promise they make is valid (e.g., a brand request to &quot;buy this  because it will work with that&quot; only works if in fact &quot;this&quot;  really does work with &quot;that&quot;).&nbsp;  Moreover, if a vendor asserts compliance where compliance does not  exist, an end user may be unable to tell whether the fault lies with a  non-compliant product or with an inadequate standard.&nbsp; As a result, not only the vendor that failed to comply loses  credibility, but all products of all vendors that assert compliance with the  same standard will lose credibility as well, and the goals of the SSO that  created the standard and its members will be defeated. </p>
              <p class="style2">                False  claims of compliance are therefore of great concern to SSOs and to end users  alike.&nbsp; Where an SSO gives a name to a  standard and the public knows the standard by that name alone, then the SSO may  prevent false claims of compliance from being made by withholding the legal  right of the offending vendor to refer to the standard in connection with a non-compliant  product. <a href="#7">7</a> <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""> </a> </p>
              <p class="style2">                While  it is not legally necessary to obtain a formal trademark registration in the  United States on the name of a standard in order to own all rights to its  usage, it is prudent to do so, since the cost is modest in comparison to the benefit  of putting the world on notice that the SSO owns the trademark.&nbsp; Since it is widely known that it has become  very simple to perform an on-line search of issued trademarks, obtaining a  trademark registration will also make it far less likely that someone else will  begin to use the same, or a confusingly similar, name for its product or  service.&nbsp; As a result, there will be  less potential that someone else's actions will dilute the value and  effectiveness of the SSO's mark, or that the SSO will be put to the trouble and  expense of asserting or defending its trademark. </p>
              <p class="style2">                However,  since ITC standards are usually intended for global adoption, it is important  to undertake an analysis in order to settle upon a cost-effective strategy for  protecting a mark, due to the fact that a commercial-scale, global trademark  program would invariably be prohibitively expensive.&nbsp; Fortunately, the a trademark convention in Europe now permits a  single filing to secure rights in multiple countries, and a very large  proportion of sales of certified products are usually expected to occur in a  comparatively small number of first world countries.&nbsp; The result is that it is possible to achieve a very meaningful  degree of protection by obtaining trademark protection in just the United States,  Europe and selected Pacific Rim countries.&nbsp;  Such a measured program of trademark registration can be completed  within the budget of most SSOs. </p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Trademarks to Associate Value with Products</em></strong><strong>:</strong> The term  &quot;branding&quot; usually connotes a use of trademarks that is broader than  simply policing compliance.&nbsp; Rather, it  seeks to associate value with compliant products in the mind of the buying  public that relates to the purpose for which the standard was created, rather  than simply with compliance with the technical elements of the standard  itself.&nbsp; For example, the right to  include the familiar &quot;Dolby&quot; brand logo on a product, indicating the  use of patented Dolby noise-suppression technology, was a valuable product  differentiator in the early days of tape decks. More recently, the earlier  noted &quot;Intel Inside&quot; ad campaign provides an example of a brand usage  that is intended to promote the goodwill of Intel as much, if not more, than  the vendor of the product in which the chip finds a home.&nbsp; In sum, Intel is seeking to create a market  perception that its technology represents a &quot;standard of excellence and  innovation&quot; with which consumers should associate added value. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Where  a branding campaign is to be launched in connection with a certification  program, however, a much larger budget is required.&nbsp; To be effective, such an initiative also requires the active  cooperation of SSO members, who should place certification logos on their  compliant products, packaging and advertising in order for the program to be  truly successful.&nbsp; Often, engaging the  cooperation of the marketing departments of large corporate members proves to  be an insurmountable hurdle, regardless of the fact that the same companies may  have invested heavily in creating the standards to which the certification and  branding would apply. <a href="#8">8</a> <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""> </a> </p>
              <p class="style2">                Nonetheless, as the video  format and ATM examples discussed above illustrate, branding may be vital in  persuading the marketplace to buy (or, in the case of the credit card, to buy  into) new classes of products and services, and the costs of brand creation may  therefore prove to be wise, or even unavoidable, investments.&nbsp; Absent such a program in the video example,  many consumers might have shied away from purchasing or renting any products at  all while the vendor community engaged in its standards war.</p>
              <p class="style2">The costs of brand  maintenance in such an example may also be finite.&nbsp; After a single standard &quot;wins&quot;, or after  interoperability issues are resolved between competing standards, the brand may  be allowed to languish, as an end-user comes to take interoperability for  granted, and expects that all products, regardless of the technology upon which  they are based, will be usable in connection with all other logically related  products.</p>
              <p class="style2">For example, today the user  of an ATM is not likely to look for, or even notice, the multiple acceptance  network logos on an ATM, because such a high degree of technical  interoperability and business reciprocity has been achieved that virtually  every ATM will now accept almost any and every card, regardless of the  issuer.&nbsp; Similarly, after the VHS format  vanquished Betamax, video rental and consumer electronics stores discontinued  stocking Betamax products entirely, making the use of the mark &quot;VHS&quot;  no longer meaningful in anything other than an historical sense.&nbsp; At that point in each example, the brand had  already done its job, although the certification process continued to live on  unnoticed by consumers in order to confirm actual compliance with the VHS standard  for the benefit of manufacturers.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong>&nbsp;  Notwithstanding the costs and constraints associated with developing,  administering and participating in standards certification programs,&nbsp; vendors and service providers nonetheless  voluntarily implement and comply with hundreds of thousands of standards,  because they believe that the benefits of compliance outweigh the costs.&nbsp; Since one of the anticipated benefits in  complying with standards is increasing sales through customer awareness of  product compliance, vendors are often willing to make promotional investments  in conducting standards-based brand awareness campaigns as well.</p>
              <p class="style2">When the certification  process works best, larger markets for goods and services are created more  quickly, and end users are better served by the greater likelihood that their  purchase expectations will be fulfilled.&nbsp;  While providing conclusive certification testing in every market  situation is not necessary, cost constraints would often render this goal  infeasible in many situations in any event.&nbsp;  In response, the marketplace has evolved multiple levels of compliance  assertion and testing that can provide both cost effective as well as  meaningful comfort in a variety of different situations, to the ultimate  benefit of vendors and end users alike.</p>

Prohibiting the use of compliance testing to favor domestic  industry by making it difficult, expensive or impossible for foreign goods to  be imported is a goal of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical  Barriers to Trade.&nbsp; Before the enactment  of such laws, countries would frequently require local compliance testing of  goods that had already been tested elsewhere instead of respecting the  certification already granted by a neutral, but non-domestic, testing service.</p>

While there is consensus on not using the word  &quot;certification&quot; in connection with self-assertions of compliance,  there is no general agreement on whether, or how, to use words such as  &quot;compliant&quot; and &quot;conformant&quot; across SSOs.&nbsp; As a result, it is important for an SSO to  define with precision which word(s) may be used in connection with the  performance of what types of tests in connection with its standards, so that  the marketplace understands what a vendor is saying when it uses a permitted  term.</p>

While the use of trademarks in certification and  branding programs has many similarities to the usage of the same tools in  connection with building brand awareness in support of proprietary products,  there are also important differences, not all of which are immediately  obvious.&nbsp; For example, while marks  designated as &quot;certification marks&quot; can be registered in some (but  not all) countries, it may be appropriate to use trademarks, service marks or  certification marks (and sometimes all three) in support of a given standards  effort, depending upon the goals and circumstances in a given case.&nbsp; A detailed review of this topic is beyond  the scope of this article.</p>

Exercising a sufficient degree of &quot;quality  control&quot; over a widely used trademark is a sensitive issue for SSOs, which  commonly do not have the resources needed to police the usage of their marks to  the same extent as commercial entities.&nbsp;  As a result, it is essential for an SSO to institute good practices with  respect to each standard as soon as it is complete, to prevent members and  others from taking actions (such as incorporating the name of a standard into a  product name) that could result in the mark becoming generic.</p>

              <p class="style2">It's been a week now since  Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="http://sev.prnewswire.com/computer-electronics/20060705/SFTH05506072006-1.html">announced</a> its ODF/Office open source converter project &ndash; time enough for at least 183 <a href="http://news.google.com/news?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2004-47%2CGGLD%3Aen&tab=wn&q=ODF+OR+opendocument+AND+microsoft+AND+converter+OR+plugin+OR+translator&btnG=Search+News">on-line  stories</a> to be written, as well as hundreds of blog entries (one expects)  and untold numbers of appended comments.&nbsp; Lest all that virtual ink fade  silently into obscurity, it seems like a good time to look back and try to  figure out What it All Means.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                There are two ways to go about that  task.&nbsp; One is the &quot;have it your way,&quot; news channel technique  (simply pick the channel that serves up your daily news just the way you like  it, whatever&nbsp;that may be &ndash; liberal, conservative or just plain  snarky).&nbsp; Nothing better than the Internet for that, where you can go shopping  in the great marketplace of interpretation (as well as willful  misinterpretation), and find more flavors than you could ever possibly  imagine.&nbsp; If you do want to test that premise, you won't be disappointed  with the myriad ways in which people have examined the entrails of the  converter story to divine (or dictate) wha's up.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                For example, there is metaphorical  religious conversion theory, from Martin LaMonica:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><a href="http://software.silicon.com/applications/0,39024653,39160150,00.htm">Redmond  has &quot;road to Damascus&quot; open source conversion</a></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">As well as differences of opinion about  whether ODF supporters are jumping for joy or expecting the worst:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><a href="http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/75315">OpenOffice developers  rejoice at Microsoft's OpenDocument Support</a>&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="style2">And, of course, there are plenty of  theories about what Microsoft may really be up to.&nbsp; Here's a sampling: </p>

              <p class="style2">If you want to read just one analysis,  though, by all means make it the acute, thorough and balanced report by  Redmonk's Steve O'Grady.&nbsp; His thoughts, as always, are a &quot;must  read.&quot;&nbsp; You can find it, together with links to additional reactions  to the announcement, <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/001877.html">here</a>, and a  follow up entry posted by Steve the next day <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/001885.html">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                The second way is to go direct to the  sources, and make up your own mind, which is what I'll do here to provide my  take on&nbsp;what&nbsp;led to Microsoft's decision, and what&nbsp;it's likely  to&nbsp;mean.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Although I've read many different  interpretations of this story by knowledgeable parties, I'm going to focus  today on just one source:&nbsp; Microsoft itself, and more specifically, its  July 6 press release, together with a conversation I had with Jason Matusow,  Microsoft's Director of Standards Affairs.&nbsp; I don't rank as high in the  blogging food chain as Steve O'Grady (he was one of two analysts that Microsoft  briefed in advance), but Jason was good enough to call me the morning after the  press release was issued, to answer any questions that I might have.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Let's start with the press release, which  is useful for two purposes: first, to learn the basic facts, and more  intriguingly, to find the messages that Microsoft wants to deliver.&nbsp;  Those&nbsp;messages relate both to the facts at hand, as well as&nbsp;to a  bigger and ever evolving strategic picture, because every press release  provides an opportunity to insert another piece into the mosaic that is the  public image that the issuer wishes to reinforce.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Press releases are especially useful in  interpreting what underlies a vendor's desired public image and strategy,  because they are extensively worked over and reviewed by multiple parties, and  therefore are as authoritative as their authors can make them.&nbsp; Hence,  while a press release is hardly the most objective source in the world, it is  highly indicative of what the issuer wants the market to think at that point in  time.&nbsp; More intriguingly, and due to the same process by which they are  written, press releases are&nbsp;also highly indicative of the bathwater that  the issuer is drinking as well.</p>
              <p class="style2">                As I read the press release, Microsoft  wants the following points to sink in regarding its new converter project:</p>
              <p class="style2">                1.&nbsp; The converters (one each,  serially, for Word, Excel and PowerPoint) are being developed at the request of  government customers.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                2.&nbsp; The converters will be created  within an open source project, for maximum transparency.</p>
              <p class="style2">                3.&nbsp; OpenXML and ODF were created for  two very different purposes, and OpenXML is far superior to ODF.&nbsp; This  will unavoidably result in some deficiencies in how well the converters will  work.</p>
              <p class="style2">4.&nbsp; This announcement is further  evidence of Microsoft's new commitment to &quot;interoperability by  design,&quot; a four-pronged approach (only one of which involves an open  process &ndash; standards).&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Here's how I see these messages fitting  into the big picture:</p>
              <p class="style2">1.&nbsp; At the government customer's  request:&nbsp; I have heard this phrase explained by two Microsoft sources as  follows: &quot;if even one citizen wants to send a document to a government in  ODF form, they have to be able to deal with it.&quot;&nbsp; The net desired  impression, then, is that the need to accommodate ODF is minimal (so don't take  this as an admission that ODF is taking off), but when the customer asks,  Microsoft listens.</p>
              <p class="style2">                2.&nbsp; Open source project:&nbsp;  Microsoft deserves points on this one.&nbsp; They aren't monkeying around, but  are putting the code out front and largely in the hands of others, while still  paying the bills.&nbsp; Is it perfect?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; But neither is  OpenOffice.org, where Sun pays the bills and supplies most of the programmers  to write the code, and largely selects what code will be written.&nbsp; It's  only fair to be consistent in how we judge competitors.</p>
              <p class="style2">                3.&nbsp; Different formats:&nbsp; Indeed  the two formats were created for two different purposes, and I expect that  there will likely be some inabilities for ODF documents to replicate, for  example, all 200 Microsoft Word borders back through 1993.&nbsp; But I assume  that there won't be (or at least won't need to be) any such problems in the other  direction.&nbsp; The main difference between the two format approaches is that  OpenXML is a format standard created to serve a single product line, while ODF  was developed to enable the creation of multiple competing products, which is  already occurring.&nbsp; Losing a few borders along the way is&nbsp;considered  to be a pretty easy tradeoff if your goal is the latter rather than the former,  because the anticipated rewards are very different.&nbsp; In fact, there is a  place for both standards, and they should not be directly compared to each  other any more than, say, a telephone and an intercom should be directly  compared, although you can talk into each of them and they share some of the  same technology.</p>
              <p class="style2">                4.&nbsp; Interoperability by  design:&nbsp; Microsoft has realized that standards are not going to go away,  and that customer demand for standards in general, and interoperability in  particular, will rise rather than fall.&nbsp; It has taken a thorough approach  to creating a new internal standards structure (interestingly, it has many lawyers,  as opposed to just technical and business people, in key positions in its  standards department), and has constructed its four-point program to address  that need.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                It is important to note that Microsoft  calls this program &quot;Interoperability by Design,&quot; rather than  &quot;Interoperability by Collaboration.&quot;&nbsp; The salient difference  between these two designations is that only one of the four roads to the  interoperability goal (standards) of the Microsoft program involves an open  process.&nbsp; The others leave Microsoft in the senior, or at minimum parity,  power position in negotiating the means of achieving interoperability &ndash; how,  and with whom it pleases.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                The official way that Microsoft phrases  this &quot;commitment to interoperability&quot; can be found in the same press  release (as well as in many other press releases, statements and documents),  and reads as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2">                Ongoing Commitment to  Interoperability</p>
                <p class="style2">                As demonstrated by the  recent announcement of the Interoperability Customer Executive Council and the  significant industry contributions to the Open XML file formats from leading  institutions like the British Library and Apple Computer Inc. at Ecma  International, Microsoft is broadening its long-term investments in and  attention to interoperability across industries and platforms <em>through such  avenues as product design, collaboration agreements with other companies,  standards and the effective licensing of its intellectual property. </em>Additional  information about Microsoft's customer-focused interoperability commitment,  including an open letter titled &quot;A Foundation for the New World of  Documents&quot; by Chris Capossela, corporate vice president of the Microsoft  Business Division Product Management Group at Microsoft, may be found online at <a href="http://sev.prnewswire.com/computer-electronics/20060705/">http://www.microsoft.com/interop</a>.

              <p class="style2">                Jason Matusow and I have debated what this means in several blog  posts, the latest one of which is <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060604112324177">here</a>, and you can read a wide  variety of other opinions in the 274 comments on and off topic about the same  piece&nbsp;that appear at <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/04/2144230&from=rss">Slashdot</a>.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Now to my conversation with Jason, which was pretty far ranging  and candid.&nbsp; Jason said, and I believe him, that the real motivation  behind the conversion project is the need to serve government users, and  especially those in countries with strong commitments to use and honor ISO  standards (ODF, of course, is now ISO/IEC 26300).&nbsp; That's a credible  reason, and if converters are going to be built anyway, as they are, Microsoft  might as well be seen to be facilitating their development rather than holding  back, and having at least some say in how the process evolves.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                I also believe that placing the project  in an open source venue was a smart move, and an honest effort to be seen as  not trying to play games.&nbsp; As Jason said &ndash; and who can question the  statement &ndash; everything that Microsoft does is going to be questioned and  attacked, so they decided to initiate the project in a way that would leave as  little to question as possible.&nbsp; Of course, one can still poke at  different aspects of how things are set up, but that's inevitable, given that  certain decisions have to be made, and when they are, they have to come out one  way or another, each with intended as well as unavoidable potential  implications.&nbsp; The choice of the BSD open source license is a good example  of this, and you can find quite a bit of discussion on line about whether this  was a good choice or a bad one, and what the motivations might be for so  choosing.&nbsp; Jason <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonmatusow/archive/2006/07/06/658184.aspx">answers  a few questions</a> on this topic&nbsp;in the comment thread at his blog.</p>
              <p class="style2">                On a related note, I asked Jason why  there was no mention of the converter project in the May 19, 2006 Microsoft  response to the Massachusetts converter RFI, given that the concept had  obviously been kicking around for some time.&nbsp; He responded that final  plans for the project had only come together in a detailed fashion in recent  weeks, and that Microsoft did not want to be accused of making a &quot;vapor  ware&quot; (my choice of words, not Jason's) announcement that could be  suspected as an effort to chill independent development efforts without a real  intention of&nbsp;delivering on the promise.&nbsp; Again, that's a reasonable  enough explanation, even if other considerations might have been involved as  well.</p>
              <p class="style2">                More intriguingly, Jason also noted that  a decision like this is still difficult to reach within Microsoft, with some  constituencies hewing to the historical, proprietary way of looking at things,  while others argue for a more adaptive, open approach.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                I expect that this is accurate as well,  and have heard the same observation from various people I know inside Microsoft  for the past year, and at each step along the way as Microsoft has loosened up  in the ODF saga: first, on licensing terms, then on issuing its covenant not to  compete, next on the submission to Ecma, and so on.&nbsp; It is logical to  assume that just such a process of cultural shift would be required, that it  would be difficult and slow, and that change agents would need real issues in  the customer base to point to in order to carry the day.</p>
              <p class="style2">                So my personal take is that we are  observing a fairly consistent, significant and, well, fascinating evolution in  the strategic thinking of one of the most powerful players in the IT  industry.&nbsp; Placing this progression in tectonic terms, there have been  some major shifts &ndash; earthquakes, if you will &ndash; at Microsoft in the past year,  such as the organization of the new open standards (and even open source)  structures within Microsoft, and the genesis and articulation of the Interoperability  by Design public message.&nbsp; We have also seen smaller tremors and  aftershocks, of which each concession in the ODF story is an example.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Obviously,&nbsp;there is still much  unrelieved tension between the Interoperability by Design message and the real  world of technology and customer expectations, both as respects open standards  as well as open source software.&nbsp; Perhaps it is as accurate to call the  Interoperability by Design program an articulation of an internal &quot;belief  system&quot; as it is to see it purely as&nbsp;a public marketing message,  since I expect that there is passion behind maintaining this halfway house  position between a proprietary world and an open environment.&nbsp; Corporate  belief systems can be almost as strong as religious convictions, and no conversion  is easy or succeeds at a uniform basis at the level of the  individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                Perhaps Martin LaMonica's Road to Damascus metaphor is then not so  inappropriate after all, although I doubt that the establishment of the open  source converter project will prove to have been the particular step along the  way at which&nbsp;the defining revelation&nbsp;in Microsoft's future was  delivered.&nbsp; But some day, I think that the remaining tension between  Microsoft and the marketplace will need to be released.&nbsp; Whether that will  be through the gelling of a new corporate <em>gestalt</em> that well-serves  Microsoft and its customers, or through an earthquake (a catastrophic antitrust  penalty?&nbsp; The rout of Microsoft products by Linux/FireFox/ODF and other  open source challengers to come?) remains to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                It will be fascinating to see whether&nbsp;the transition from  Bill Gates to Ray Ozzie in the master architect's chair will prove to be an  opportunity to provide a smooth and easy release of this tectonic tension, or  simply a ratification of the <em>ancien regime </em>that sets up an ultimate  catastrophe<em>.</em></p>

              <p><span class="style56"><em>#41</em></span><strong class="style38"><em> Live'n the WiFi LifeStyle: the iPod Bows to the Router</em></strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Here&rsquo;s an interesting bit of data from  the wild:&nbsp; 8 out of 10 folks that own both an iPod and a wireless router  would give up their cool music tool before they'd do without their boring,  clunky router.&nbsp; The same percentage of those sampled would also give up  their home phone before they'd sacrifice their ability to surf the Web from  their favorite couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;The data can be found in a <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/news/mediaadvisory-071106-wifimostdesirable/en/">survey</a> conducted by Kelson Research for the <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/%20">WiFi  Alliance</a>, the consortium that promotes IEEE WiFi 802.11 standards and, more  importantly, certifies compliance with them as well. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Surprised?&nbsp; Don't be, because the  iPod/iTunes system&nbsp;comprises a closed, proprietary environment, while WiFi  products are based on&nbsp;a continuously evolving family of&nbsp;open  standards, and that makes a far bigger difference than you might imagine.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                If this sounds like too simplistic an  explanation, consider this:&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                Let's look at the numbers first (gross  sales and rate of change).&nbsp; What we see is that&nbsp;there are many, many  more wireless-enabled devices in the field than there are iPods.&nbsp;  According to research analyst <a href="http://www.in-stat.com/about.asp">In-Stat</a>,  wireless chipset sales <a href="http://www.in-stat.com/Abstract.asp?ID=28&SKU=IN0501813NT">hit 140  million</a> last year, and should reach 430 million per year in 2009, by which  time there should already be over a billion chipsets in active use.&nbsp; 40  million of the chipsets sold last year found their way into home and small  office/home office (SOHO) routers, and another 45 million into laptops and  other mobile PCs.&nbsp; That leaves roughly 55 million more to be incorporated  into phones and other mobile devices.&nbsp; Moreover, that 140 million number  was up 50% from the year before.</p>
              <p class="style2">                In contrast, another analyst (UBS  Investment Research) <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/stockwatch/2006/06/21.1.shtml">expects iPod  sales</a> to come in about a million units under projection this year, with  about 39.8 million new iPods being bought in 2006, and a flattening in iPod  sales growth after rapid expansion in prior years.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                While comparing music players and mobile  Internet access points is not a totally fair&nbsp;comparison, the ability of  WiFi to achieve such dramatically larger sales numbers is still instructive,  since few new capabilities of any kind enjoy such explosive growth.&nbsp; When  they do, though, its often because they are based on open&nbsp;standards, and  from two resulting,&nbsp;related effects:&nbsp;&nbsp;the ability and likelihood  of multiple vendors to build new products, because the standard upon which the  new products are based is open, and the tempting size of the market demand that  can rapidly evolve because of the rich selection of competing products.&nbsp;  The result is sometimes referred to as a &quot;virtuous cycle&quot; of  incentives and rewards to both sides of the sales equation. </p>
              <p class="style2">                With that as an introduction, let's take  a look at the WiFi marketplace, which is shared by many competitors, and the  portable digital music play niche, which is dominated by the iPod and iTunes, a  commercial combo that has delivered Apple the highest quarterly earnings in its  history.</p>
              <p class="style2">                First, it is worthwhile noting that there  are also very successful players in the WiFi space (such as Linksys), a result  made possible in part by the fact that multiple competitors have developed  diverse WiFi-based products and services, allowing for more than a single  company to achieve success.&nbsp; We can  assume that one reason this is true is because the WiFi wireless market is  based on open standards, while the mobile music market includes several  controlled formats - the most popular of which is not available for  license.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                As one measure of comparison to drive  home this point, the WiFi Alliance has over 250 members, including hardware,  software, silicon, consumer electronic, and other vendors&nbsp; (you can see a  list <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/our_members.php">here</a>, but be prepared  for a long scroll).&nbsp; While it's true that the dynamics of most IEEE 802.11  working groups are highly competitive (to put it mildly), the standards these  committees set out to develop have thus far all been&nbsp;finally approved  (unlike the abandoned <a href="http://www.techworld.com/mobility/features/index.cfm?featureid=2437">UWB  project</a>), after which everyone works hard to get them widely adopted. </p>
              <p class="style2">                Of course, in the case of&nbsp;the iPod,  &quot;everyone&quot; (other than Apple) is a competitor at the format as well  as the product level, unless they're making iPod accessories.&nbsp; As a  result, the products, services, advertising, promotion and ingenuity dedicated  to making the iPod more attractive and more useful are limited, while there are  hundreds of companies, from the largest to the smallest companies in many industries,  that are all working to tout the WiFi value proposition.</p>
              <p class="style2">                Next, it must be noted that&nbsp;not  everyone is willing to buy into a proprietary system that traps the customer  more thoroughly (just as Apple intends) with every iTune she buys.&nbsp; And  while Apple is incredibly creative in what it designs, an iPod owner's ability  to satisfy her appetite for new techno delights is still limited to the candy  that Apple decides to offer her.&nbsp; If the iTunes format was not  proprietary, other vendors could challenge Apple more effectively on price,  features, and design &ndash; and anyone could play songs purchased from iTunes (or  elsewhere) on those other wares as well.</p>
              <p class="style2">                But most of all, the rewards of buying  a&nbsp;WiFi-enabled system continue to multiply exponentially, while the value  of buying into the iTunes system can, at best, increase arithmetically as the  stock of iTunes is expanded.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because you can still only listen  to an iTune on an iPod, or on another Apple product.&nbsp; With WiFi, the  standard is available to anyone, and therefore everyone is making use of  it.&nbsp; Not only are multiple chipset makers churning out price-competitive  chips, but hardware makers automatically include those chipsets in almost all  (90%) of the laptops they ship.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                Similarly, Starbucks offers WiFi&nbsp;access  in order to sell more lattes, and entire cities, like Boston, plan on providing  free, universal WiFi access for the benefit of their citizens, in order to  polish the city's image, and thereby boost the local economy&nbsp;through  competing more effectively&nbsp;in the ongoing competition to attract employers  and talent.&nbsp; In short, the popularity of WiFi encourages multiple  constituencies to invest in providing access, and to reap the indirect benefits  that such an investment can provide.&nbsp; You can't do anything comparable to  that with an iTune, nor would you want to (why invest in what you cannot  control?)</p>
              <p class="style2">                Still, this is&nbsp;just the  beginning.&nbsp; The home is on the verge of becoming <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/feb06.php">pervasively enabled</a> with wireless capabilities, and wireless mobile devices of all types continue  to proliferate.&nbsp; That's where those extra 300 million chipsets per year  will be going by 2009.</p>
              <p class="style2">                There is another lesson to be drawn from  the wireless example that helps to explain why someone could be more strongly  attached to their humble router than to their sexy iPod.&nbsp; Let's call it  the rise of the &quot;WiFi Lifestyle.&quot;&nbsp; True, you won't find any  striking ads on billboards of wildly gyrating silhouettes holding laptops, and  it's doubtful that a Dell would be the best accessory to take to a trendy club  in any event.&nbsp; But just as white ear buds score high on the teenager index  of cool, freedom of access to the Internet has huge appeal to all ages when it  comes to how they want to live their lives today.&nbsp; More and more, we want,  and expect to have, ready access to an exploding range of information,  services, games and more from the Internet, wherever we may be.</p>
              <p class="style2">                As a result, the perceived value of  having always-on Internet capability becomes greater on a daily basis, while an  iPod remains just an attractively designed, not very durable, rather expensive,  and regularly obsolete music box.&nbsp; In short, a&nbsp;music box&nbsp;that  will never provide more value to you in the future&nbsp;than it delivered on  the day that you bought it.</p>
              <p class="style2">                That's the more obviously germane part of  my last point. The more subtle (and to me interesting) part of my lifestyle  point is this:&nbsp; the actual value of any single WiFi access point to us is  not, in fact, all that great.&nbsp; We could easily live without Internet  access at any particular Starbucks, or even lose it at home entirely (after  all, we could always pull our chair closer to the cable jack).&nbsp; But we are  placing an increasingly high value on being surrounded by wireless access wherever  we may be.&nbsp; Wherever we are, we want it, and that's it &ndash; because we've  bought into the <em>WiFi Lifestyle</em>.</p>
              <p class="style2">                While it's doubtful that many of the 8  out of 10 respondents in the survey realize that their affection for their home  router is based more on a lifestyle decision than their affection for surfing  the Web from the couch, I'm pretty confident that this is what explains the  Kelson Research survey results. </p>
              <p class="style2">                All of which provides yet another splendid example of how an open  standard makes participation in the creation of a new network attractive and  profitable, thereby enabling a logarithmic increase in innovation,  implementation, value and customer appeal.&nbsp; This &quot;network  effect&quot; has been recognized at least since the advent of the railroads,  and it is becoming a bigger and bigger reality in our world today, because  networks of all sorts are becoming essential to virtually everything that we  do. </p>
              <p class="style2">                What does this say about the future of  the newly-renascent Apple Computer?&nbsp; I think it's possible that the iPod  may represent the high-water mark of that company's proprietary design  strategy.&nbsp; With the market's ever-increasing expectations for  interoperability, and even governments (such as in France) threatening to  restrict the sale of music in the proprietary iTunes format, Steve Jobs may  find himself on the verge of being forced to compete on design alone, even as  his Company enjoys historical highs in its sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                The  good news for Steve is that, given Apple's chops in the design department, I'd  guess that Apple's future will be far rosier when, as and if he ever gets  through that knothole.</p>

                <strong>An Antic Disposition (blog) July 18, 2006</strong>&nbsp;...There is a game called  Zendo, where a player, called the Master, forms in his mind a secret rule which  governs the selection and arrangement of objects (often small colored blocks or  shapes). Arrangements which conform to the secret rule are said to have 'Buddha  nature&quot;. The other players take turns trying to select and arrange their  own blocks to conform to what they think the secret rule is, to which the  Master will acknowledge success or failure....Microsoft is playing Zendo with  the Office XML specification. The Master has formed a secret rule. He calls it,  &quot;backwards compatibility with billions of office documents&quot;. But  since the file format documentation for the proprietary legacy binary formats  has not been made public, the rule might as well just been called &quot;Buddha  nature&quot;&hellip;.<a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2006/07/game-of-zendo.html">Full  Story</a> </p>

                <strong>ITNews.com Australia July 8, 2006</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft's decision to offer  free translation software to enable its Office software to operate easily with  OpenDocument Format (ODF) software was greeted Thursday with elation in some  quarters, but with cautious optimism in other quarters. Hailing the move was  Melanie Wyne, executive director of the Initiative For Software Choice (ISC),  who said: &quot;We continue to prefer these developments to heavy-handed, and  often clumsy government regulation.&quot;...Andrew Updegrove, editor of  consortiuminfo.org and an ODF supporter, had faint praise for the Microsoft  move while noting that there wasn't really much new to the announcement because  Microsoft's chief software architect Ray Ozzie had said Microsoft was working  on a translator - also variously called a converter and a plug-in - last fall.  Updegrove, a partner in the Boston law firm of Gesmer Updegrove, called  Microsoft's action a &quot;concession (that) clearly makes it easier for  governments and other users to feel safe in making the switch from Office to  ODF-supporting software, since Microsoft will be collaborating to make document  exchanges smooth and effortless.&quot; <a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/newsstory.aspx?CIaNID=34571">...Full Story</a></p>

This suite  integrates with the ODF standard.Google also recently acquired the Writely  on-line word-processing program, which allows multiple users to create and edit  the same document in real-time through their web browsers.

                <strong>IEEE Intelligent Systems July 26, 2006</strong>&nbsp;The original Scientific  American article on the Semantic Web appeared in 2001. It described the  evolution of a Web that consisted largely of documents for humans to read to  one that included data and information for computers to manipulate. The  Semantic Web is a Web of actionable information&mdash;information derived from data  through a semantic theory for interpreting the symbols. This simple idea,  however, remains largely unrealized. Shopbots and auction bots abound on the Web,  but these are essentially handcrafted for particular tasks; they have little  ability to interact with heterogeneous data and information types. Because we  haven't yet delivered large-scale, agent-based mediation, some commentators  argue that the Semantic Web has failed to deliver. We argue that agents can  only flourish when standards are well established and that the Web standards  for expressing shared meaning have progressed steadily over the past five  years.... <a href="http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_dsonline/dsonline/2006/07/x3096.pdf">...Full  Story</a></p>

Not long ago, the US National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the DOC agency that  directly supervises ICANN, asked for public input on how well ICANN has been  fulfilling its mission. The result of the NTIA's review could at one extreme be  to conclude that ICANN is ready (as envisioned at the time that the MOU was  signed) to become completely independent of US supervision, as demanded by many  countries around the world, and at the other, to take the root directories away  from ICANN entirely, and authorize another entity to be their steward. The  following is one non-profit's evalutation of ICANN, with links to its related  submission to the NTIA.

              <strong>David L Fair</strong><br>
              <strong>EDN.com July 24, 2006</strong>&nbsp;The new PCI (Peripheral Component  Interconnect) Express spec provides the biggest improvement in more than a  decade in I/O performance for computation systems, significantly improving  graphics in desktop PCs and workstations. Intel initially launched the spec in  its chip sets in mid-2004, and the technology has become mainstream in high-end  systems. But PCI Express is far more than an avenue to better games or video.  As have many other PC innovations, PCI Express will enable significant  applications, such as medical imaging, and serve in industrial control and many  other embedded-system roles. <a href="http://www.edn.com/article/CA6351293.html?industryid=2283">...Full Story</a></span>

                <strong>Press Release</strong><br>
                <strong>MarketWire.com July 19, 2006</strong>&nbsp;MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA -- The Unicode&reg;  Consortium announced today the release of the new version of the Unicode Common  Locale Data Repository (CLDR 1.4), providing key building blocks for software  to support the world's languages. CLDR is by far the largest and most extensive  standard repository of locale data. This data is used by a wide spectrum of  companies for their software internationalization and localization: adapting  software to the conventions of different languages for such common software  tasks as formatting of dates, times, time zones, numbers, and currency values;  sorting text; choosing languages or countries by name; and many others. <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=144527">...Full  Story</a></p>

                <strong>eWeek.com July 10, 2006</strong>&nbsp;The Object Management Group has announced  the adoption of the OMG Systems Modeling Language as a standard. OMG and the  International Council on Systems Engineering worked together to extend the  OMG's UML (Unified Modeling Language) specification to come up with SysML,...a  general-purpose graphical modeling language for specifying, analyzing,  designing and verifying complex systems that may include hardware, software,  information, personnel, procedures and facilities.As a subset of UML 2.0, SysML  provides systems engineers with graphical representation and semantic  foundation for system requirements. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1985818,00.asp">...Full Story</a></p>
