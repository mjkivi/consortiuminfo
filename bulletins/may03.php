                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There once was a time when anyone using a computer could employ anything that anyone else had created. No one had to worry whether any information or application resident on a computer could be used by anyone else. IT life was simple and good. Then the second computer was built, and the struggle to return to the Garden of Interoperability was on. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For many years, interoperability was desirable for reasons such as avoiding &quot;lock in&quot; to single vendor solutions, to be able to access a wider, and more price competitive range of products and services, and to broaden the pool of potential IT hires. But with the invention of the Ethernet, and the later advent of the Internet, the need to exchange data and permit the interoperation of enormous, wide area networks has become a matter of even greater urgency. Imagine, for example, managing the IT resources of the United States Federal government and all of its agencies.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There have been many efforts launched over the years to achieve interoperability Nirvana, many of which have focused on the Unix operating system. While today's Linux development efforts add a new open source dimension (and attendant benefits) to the process, the core value of the deliverable remains a stable, open operating system that will facilitate the assembling of interoperable systems.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The latest methodological approach to achieve interoperability is web services -- a series of processes and functions for developing, integrating and deploying network-based software applications. Using the web services approach, software applications are packaged as single entities and &quot;published&quot; to the network, where they can interact with other applications using Internet-standard technologies and connections.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the grand vision, web services would be used to create open, distributed systems whereby companies and individuals can access information, tools and products quickly, inexpensively and efficiently. In a world architected to support pervasive web services, vendors like IBM and Microsoft see themselves becoming IT &quot;utilities,&quot; selling services upon demand across an Internet &quot;grid.&quot; ZapThink LLC, a leading XML and Web Services analyst firm, predicts that the web services security market alone will reach $4.4 billion by 2006, and that the total web services market will exceed $25 billion.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is such a golden world of pervasive web services interoperability just over the horizon? Or are we simply witnessing another example of over-enthusiasm for &quot;The Next Big Thing,&quot; in this case even more aggressively hyped in an effort to breath life back into a moribund market for all things IT?</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who knows. But it is certain that the ability to realize even a modest portion of the potential of web services is totally dependent on the continuing evolution -- and pervasive adoption -- of both the base level standards as well as the more specialized specifications that would be needed in the levels above them. For this to happen, the &quot;right&quot; standards bodies will need to support the necessary component processes.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How does one define the &quot;right&quot; standards bodies? In our last issue, we considered whether the market, or the government, should decide the hallmarks of a &quot;good&quot; standard setting process. In this issue, we use the real-world example of web standards and the activities of the principal players in the market to analyze whether the definition of a &quot;good&quot; standards body can be situational, rather than absolute.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We would submit that there is no such thing as a perfect standards body for all purposes. While certain stringent process controls and rules of operation might be essential in certain situations (e.g., where public safety standards are concerned), some of the same controls and rules could be useless drags upon efficiency in another (e.g., where a necessary but non-strategic technical standard in a narrow niche is involved). It is no coincidence that it is in the rapidly evolving world of IT where consortia have flourished, or that the members of those entities have demonstrated a willingness to experiment with process and evolve new methods of operation.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, we believe that it is healthy to accept the appropriateness of a range of stringent process options when constructing the right mechanism for setting a given standard. The instant situation, needs and goals will indicate the process needs, and (fortunately) the diverse range of existing standards bodies may provide an already-existing platform for the project. If not, no one will be more knowledgeable than the technical leaders in a new area to judge what process will best serve the current need.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently, some were surprised when Microsoft and IBM decided to offer the BPEL4WS 1.1 specification, which they had co-authored with BEA Systems Inc., SAP AG and Siebel Systems, Inc. to OASIS. Why surprised? Because the widely respected World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) had already commissioned a Web Services Choreography Interface (WSCI) working group to solve many of the same web services needs. With OASIS agreeing to charter a working group to further develop and support the BPEL specification, some feared that Microsoft and IBM were acting against the best interests of the marketplace.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So - from the standpoint of facilitating the orderly enablement of web services, was the contribution to OASIS a good thing, or a bad thing? Time will tell, but already companies such as Oracle, BEA, SAP and Sun Microsystems have announced their intentions to participate in the working groups of both W3C and OASIS, with the goal of ensuring that the work product of the two organizations will be complementary, rather than competitive. IBM, on the other hand, has said that it will not participate in the W3C effort &quot;at this time.&quot; </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the view of some, the BPEL contribution is a sign of a fragmenting marketplace. But in the view of others, there is a proper role for both W3C and OASIS in web standards, with W3C continuing to focus on more foundational standards such as XML and SOAP, and organizations like OASIS providing useful contributions at higher levels. In this view, the process and focus of OASIS may offer the most experienced, appropriate platform for an effort at this level.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, we would submit that the diversity of standard setting body choices might often (if not always) achieve a better result. By providing the marketplace with choices, a given standards effort can be launched from the optimal platform. Given that all standards work is ultimately consensual, it is not likely that a standard setting effort will attract a critical mass of participants, or that its work product will become widely adopted, if the market concludes that proprietary motives are manipulating the process or that the technical quality of the work product is poor. Similarly, as with all other aspects of a free market, having competition keeps a standards body nimble and responsive, and less likely to become flaccid or subject to manipulation. Finally, the stress of competition and the inability of any organization to be guaranteed a technical &quot;turf&quot; facilitates the active, healthy evolution of the standard setting process.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the presence of choice also presents the potential for false starts, duplicative effort, confusion, and delayed take up of new standards in the marketplace. But that same marketplace has a tendency to react dynamically to such threats, with individual companies being more than willing to inform vendors of their desires, and announcing their standards implementation intentions. And standards organizations themselves have a tradition of establishing liaisons - both formal and informal. Hence, a constant process of adjustment will usually (though admittedly not always) prevent truly destructive divisions to form in the marketplace.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the question remains: who should set the standards for web services? Just watch and wait -- the market will decide. And that's not a bad thing.</font></p>

                              <em><strong>I. Introduction</strong></em>: &nbsp;There is an old saw that goes something like this: &quot;Having a standard for a given job is good - that's why people come up with so many of them.&quot; Sadly, there is some basis for truth in this satirical observation. In a perfect world, the commercial lions would lie down with the lambs, and there would be a single, robust, elegant and universally adopted standard for every IT need.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Back here in the real world, however, there is a rough and tumble marketplace in which vendors let down their commercial guards (just a bit) to collectively set standards with end-users and other interested parties enabling new product niches within which the same vendors will then aggressively compete. At times, competing standards efforts are launched, and when that happens, the universal adoption of a final standard is often delayed. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But as often also happens, a new standard can relate to an emerging technology that sometimes fails to realize its originally claimed potential. For example, while it appears that both the Bluetooth and the Wifi standards will be broadly implemented, other early contenders (such as HomeRF) have fallen by the wayside. Sometimes, starting several horses from the gate proves to be a useful and prudent strategy.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The advent of web services provides an especially interesting opportunity to view the standard setting process in action, given the enormous commercial consequences of success, the number of capable organizations bodies available to participate in the creation of the essential standards, and the large number of standards which are necessary to fully achieve the web services vision.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently, there has been a flurry of articles written about whether the W3C, instead of OASIS, should have been invited to continue the development of the BPEL4WS 1.1 specification. Is this a case of the press blowing a situation out of proportion, or the first indication of a real problem? And if the situation does deserve attention, how do the organizations involved plan to work together to ensure a result that is beneficial to all?</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To find out, we went directly to the organizations involved.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>II. Survey Methodology.</em></strong> For this article, we posed a series of questions to some of the most active players in the web services standards arena: two standard setting bodies (W3C and OASIS) and the Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I), which is supporting the evolution of web services in a different and interesting way (see the following article: <a href="#trends">New Wine - Old Bottles: WS-I Brings a New Dimension to the Art Of Making Standards Succeed</a>). </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The questions posed were intended to give each organization the opportunity to present its position within the overall standard setting effort, and to share its thoughts about past accomplishments and future challenges. Each organization was presented with the same questions. Some respondents declined to answer a given question. While some answers were redacted to eliminate repetition and to manage length, the actual text included below is otherwise reproduced verbatim.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also interviewed representatives of OpenGis Consortium in order to access the educated opinions of an independent source on the same questions. Their observations are reflected as well.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The respondents for the organizations were:</font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB</em></strong>: <em><strong>How many web services projects are underway at your organization right now?</strong></em></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS</em></strong>: The answer depends on how broadly you define Web services. OASIS has 57 technical committees as of today, and most of them relate to Web services in one way or another.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: W3C has Five Working Groups/Task Forces with the words &quot;Web Services&quot; in them, and at least another 5 which have produced the foundation for all other WS Work, no matter which organization you look at, or which prefix they use for their specifications. They are providing the normative references for dozens of efforts in vertical and upper layer horizontal efforts.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Homepage for W3C's WS Activity</em>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/Activity" target="_off">W3C's WS Activity Statement: </a> </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>WS-I</em></strong>: WS-I is not a standards organization like W3C, Oasis or IETF. WS-I is not creating standards. WS-I sits downstream from standards bodies to provide companion guidelines, conventions, and best practices to promote interoperable implementations. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB</em></strong>: <em><strong>What are those projects?</strong></em></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS</em></strong>: OASIS is responsible for UDDI, one of the four pieces defined by WS-I in their &quot;basic WS profile&quot; (XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI). OASIS also hosts a large body of work that goes beyond the foundational specifications, work that makes Web services practical. The OASIS UN/CEFACT ebXML standards are complex Web services. Developed before the term 'WS' was coined, ebXML delivers the functional requirements of Web services for business critical applications. Four OASIS technical committees are devoted to ebXML: And certainly, without security, Web services would be of little use. OASIS Open Standards such as SAML, XACML, and specifications in progress, such as WS-Security, and foundational security standards, such as PKI, all have a place in the big picture of Web services. (<a href="#v">See the Technical Addendum for additional information</a>)</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: Over 19 Technical Specifications are under development at W3C within its WS-named Working Groups and task forces. Another 10 W3C Recommendations serve as the foundations for all of the WS work in all organizations, including XML, XML Schema, XML Signature, and XML Encryption. A detailed list is at the bottom of this article. (<a href="#v">See the Technical Addendum for additional information</a>)</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB: Which project do you think is most interesting or important, and why?</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS</em></strong>: All are interesting and important. ebXML is global and comprehensive, UDDI is foundational and widely recognized, WS-Security is essential, WSBPEL is the most recent and is generating quite a lot of interest.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: The most important spec - perhaps for all organizations interested in Web Services - is the spec being produced by W3C's XML Protocol Working Group - SOAP 1.2. SOAP is the most central spec around which all Web Services activity centers - can you imagine a single WS article where it isn't mentioned? - and more or less defines WS. SOAP 1.2 is the first solid, standardized version of SOAP, with full support for W3C Recommendations, support for multiple protocols (not just HTTP), and over 400 issues resolved. That said, WSDL is frequently mentioned as a core WS specification. WSDL 1.2, the first standardized version, will likely go to Last Call later this year.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB: Other organizations are also very active in Web services standards definition and development. Please name those organizations that you think are important to the evolution of Web services, and why.</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS</em></strong>: Certainly, the W3C plays a major role in defining foundational standards, such as XML and Web Services Architecture. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: W3C's process places emphasis on liaisons - in fact, all W3C WGs are required to establish liaisons with all identified relevant groups. And all W3C Members review all proposed work before any technical resources are assigned. As a result, our 410+ organizational Members - which include OASIS - are aware of all potential and new work, and can say what is in scope, and who we need to coordinate with. The full W3C liaison list is at: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/StdLiaison" target="_off">http://www.w3.org/2001/11/StdLiaison</a></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the topic comes to Web Services, we set up liaisons at a technical level with whatever organization the vendors choose as the destination for their initial specs. As a result, W3C WGs work with many TCs in OASIS, and with individuals involved in the non-standard, profile work in WS-I. In the past, we have also had connections with groups such as OMG (for XML Protocol/SOAP 1.2 work).</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>WS-I</em></strong>: W3C, OASIS and IETF are all actively participating in the creation of standards for Web services. WS-I works in cooperation with these organizations to create resource and guidance to ensure interoperability of these standards.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB: Please explain how the goals of your organization relate to the goals of these other organizations.</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS: </em></strong>OASIS and W3C maintain a good working relationship -- one that's longstanding. We continue our commitment to working together to coordinate the development of the broad spectrum of Web services specifications as much as possible.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: W3C's goal is to build an open, extensible technical foundation for the Web. Web Services is one part of this foundation. We strive to make W3C specifications interoperable with each other and with relevant foundational specifications from other bodies, such as IETF and ISO.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We work for universal access by eliminating barriers to access based on hardware, software, network infrastructure, native language, culture, geographical location, or physical or mental ability; all of our specifications are reviewed by our Internationalization Activity and by our Web Accessibility Initiative to ensure that they meet this goal as far as possible. In order to ensure that Web technology scales, W3C stresses decentralization and evolvability of technology. In order to ensure that the technology works well for all, W3C stresses consensus-based development, from the initial review of proposals for W3C work, through the development of working drafts, to the final decision on making a specification a Recommendation.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have a long history of good coordination with IETF and other SDOs, based primarily on cooperation at the technical level. In some cases, liaison is made more difficult by differences in overall goals of the organizations or by differences in intellectual property policy: the W3C is firmly committed to ensuring that Web technology, like the foundational technologies of the Internet, are available for royalty-free implementation by any interested party.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>WS-I:</em></strong> We bring the work of multiple standards development organizations together for the purpose of providing clarity and conformance around Web services. In addition, this implementers&#8217; forum seeks to provide implementation guidance to customers. In this way WS-I acts as a standards integrator, a role that is beyond the scope of any single standards organization.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB: Do you think that the various involved consortia are working well together, or is there a level of inefficiency, competition or overlap that should be resolved?</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS</em></strong>: The involved consortia organizations are generally working well together, sharing information and trying to coordinate events. The consortia organizations are also encouraging our respective members (who work on the respective technical specifications) to coordinate their TC/WG activities with technical liaisons whenever possible.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: There is certainly some inefficiency introduced by having work in related fields taking place in different organizations; it's not clear that such inefficiencies can be avoided. In the Web Services space, the difficulty seems to be particularly acute. At W3C, WGs are required to liaise with any external group identified as relevant. Since many of the same people participate in these groups, there are natural opportunities for liaison, but it does mean extra work for the individuals involved. Since liaison at the technical level is essential to make the best of the current fragmented situation, W3C is committed to doing our best to encourage such liaison.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>WS-I</em></strong>: WS-I&#8217;s mission is crisply &#8211; even narrowly &#8211; defined, and is fundamentally different from the standards bodies discussed above. As a result, no coordination difficulties are apparent.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB: Do you think the marketplace has totally bought in to the use of Web services? If there is still work to be done in this regard, what sectors &quot;get it&quot; the most and what sectors still need to be worked on the most?</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS</em></strong>: The Internet software industry has certainly embraced the use of Web services, however, I don't think we'll see widespread pick-up from the end user companies and large industries until interoperable solutions are available that implement a full range of Web services infrastructure specifications that have been approved through open standards consortia processes like those at W3C and OASIS.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: The fragmentation of the standardization landscape is clearly slowing the adoption of Web Services technology. Customers will buy in only when they feel they can trust the results, and can implement the technology on a non-proprietary basis without fear of vendor lock-in.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">W3C hears a growing level of concern from companies for which Web Services could potentially offer a solution to their application to application communications, both within their company and between their company and other entities. There is uncertainly regarding the number of organizations developing WS specs, and how this might affect the coherence, interoperability and quality of the specs. There is uncertainty regarding the licensing structure of specifications not developed under a clear patent policy like that at W3C. Press regarding (non-existent) battles between organizations, divergence of approaches and disagreements between WS vendors, the large number of WS specs (many of which have not been submitted to any standards body), etc., also contribute to uncertainty. The vendor and standards community has its work cut out for it to build confidence in the customer community.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>WS-I</em></strong>: The marketplace has certainly embraced Web services. Nearly all enterprises of significant size (and many smaller ones as well) have begun developing Web service-based applications and/or integrations. Indeed, hundreds of Web services projects that are in production have been described in the literature. Having said that, Web services are still a young technology. The current state of Web services standards address only basic interoperability. As of today, deeper technical requirements still have to be written in a proprietary manner. As a result, most companies are using Web services today to expose &#8220;lighter-weight&#8221; services. As standards mature, as the market&#8217;s experience deepens, Web services will become more common for more mission-critical processing.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is difficult to generalize, but leading industries in the Web services arena include financial services, travel, government and manufacturing. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>CSB: What are the key challenges (technical, business adoption or other) that need to be addressed in order to achieve pervasive use of web services?</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>OASIS</em></strong>: Web services cannot be deployed without open standards. The role of OASIS is to ensure key Web services standards are developed the right way--through an open process, with the widest possible representation, in coordination with related specifications, at a speed that meets the needs of the market.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: The market needs:</font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C</em></strong>: The way work is done, and the goals of organizations, vary widely, even in the area of Web Services. It's W3C's belief that the success of Web Services rests in its first name - Web. Not one or two vendors' views of it, but what has brought us here in the first place: elegant simple protocols, supporting a decentralized model that all can build upon. After 9 years of developing Web Standards, W3C has a track record of successful completion and adoption of web technology work among what are often competitive entities. We've seen in other tech/Web sectors what happens when the marketing outruns the technical results, and it's our Members' goal not to see a replay of that in WS.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>IV. Other Views</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a recent interview with Computerworld, W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee observed that standards groups are &quot;very different places.&quot; But does the same observation apply to standards? In other words: are some web services standards &quot;different&quot; from other standards in a way that indicates one organization rather than another should develop and control them? And if so, which ones? </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David Schell, the founder, president and standards visionary of <a href="http://www.opengis.org/" target="_off">OpenGIS Consortium</a>, thinks that some web services standards indeed are different. He endorses the view that those who set foundational standards involving the Web should take the public interest into account, whether that organization is a consortium or an accredited organization that follows the formal ANSI process. In fact, in his view, the W3C has a process which is more open than would be required by ANSI to obtain accreditation. He particularly approves of W3C's public comment processes and (now) codified IPR policy which makes it extremely unlikely that a royalty-bearing specification will be adopted. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, Carl Reed, OpenGIS' Executive Director of Specifications Programs, notes that not all web services standards require the W3C approach. He summarizes the starting positions of W3C and OASIS as follows:</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>W3C Vision</em></strong>: The World Wide Web Consortium was created to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With this as a starting point, Reed analyzes the situation as follows:</font></p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">W3C is not necessarily the place for all Web Services work. The W3C has traditionally worked in the area of core tools/standards for building applications on the Web, maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the Web (e.g., XML, HTML, SVG and SOAP). OASIS and the OGC, on the other hand, use the standards/tools developed by the W3C membership (and vendor provided implementations) as a foundation on which to build domain specific standards. The OGC deals with things geospatial. The OASIS tends to deal with things business (process, value chains, business content encoding, etc). The one possible area of overlap contention is UDDI, which should probably &quot;belong&quot; to the W3C process. </font></p>
                          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given the respective histories and areas of expertise of the various standards organizations, OASIS is most probably the correct home for BPEL. One (especially the press) can read all kinds of insidious things into this move (IBM/Microsoft are trying to undermine W3C etc) but at the end of the day, W3C does not really deal with solving domain specific interoperability issues. They are developing cross cutting standards that others can build on. It is similar to the fact that the W3C builds upon the infrastructure provided by the hundreds of standards that are the Internet (and which are &quot;owned&quot; by the IETF).</font></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of the day, of course, there may be no &quot;best&quot; place for every standard. And while there may in a given case be a standard setting body that might commonly be acknowledged to be most appropriate, all will not necessarily be lost if a given effort begins elsewhere. Ultimately, the standards development process is organic, dynamic, and elastic enough that if a standard is important, then the industry will direct its attention towards nurturing that standard wherever the seed may fall.</font></p>

Certainly, the consortium approach has the potential for producing rapid results (even if not all organizations actually achieve that benefit). A less often appreciated characteristic of the consortium approach is its inherent flexibility. Flexibility of approach can be essential to enable swift adaptations to new market conditions and the generation of effective institutional responses. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The advent of web services -- and the founding of the Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) -- present an excellent example of how the flexibility of the consortium approach can help the potential beneficiaries of a new business model gain rapid credibility and traction for that model.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>The Bottle:</em></strong> There have long been promotional as well as standard setting consortia - as well as consortia that fulfill both functions (see <a href="/links/promotional/">http://www.consortiuminfo.org/links/promotional/</a>). Some promotional consortia support standards work done by other consortia, while others promote the takeup of standards developed by ANSI accredited organizations (e.g., the 1335 Association, which supports the IEEE 1335 standard: <a href="/links/1355.php">http://www.consortiuminfo.org/links/1355.php</a>). Other consortia have been formed to develop and promote &quot;best practices&quot; and educate the marketplace about new standards-based processes, products or services.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>The Wine:</em></strong> In the case of web services, a group of vendor companies identified a new set of tasks that needed attention in order to facilitate the launch of the web services model, including the development of deliverables such as profiles of web services standards suites, the use of which could facilitate the rapid deployment of web services.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rather than approach an existing standard setting organization and attempting to interest it in meeting needs that extend beyond its normal purview, a founding group of companies (Accenture, BEA Systems, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP) announced in February of 2002 that they would launch a new consortium for the express purpose of creating such profiles and related tools, and otherwise promoting and facilitating the pervasive implementation of web services. The presumed beneficiaries of its work would be producers of web services products (ISVs), consumers of web services (user companies), and various standards organizations.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The organization they formed was named the &quot;Web Services Interoperability Organization&quot; (or more familiarly, &quot;WS-I&quot;). Fifteen months after the announcement of the new collaboration, 170 companies have rallied to the call, valuable work product is already nearing completion, and WS-I has become an acknowledged player in the network of consortia that are helping make web services a reality.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mission of WS-I, as articulated by its founders, was &quot;to deliver clear and consistent recommendations for ensuring interoperability between web services across platforms, applications, and programming languages.&quot; It also seeks to promote the appeal of web services by: making their implementation more commercially attractive through lowering technical obstacles to adoption; reducing complexity and efforts needed to integrate separately-developed web services; and ensuring the continued evolution of web services technologies via clear and implementable processes and confirmable interoperability test suites. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The specific deliverables of WS-I are interesting in their own right, and a reflection of the broad range of work products upon which a group of companies can agree to collaborate, using the consortium process. As described at the WS-I website:</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;[WS-I's] deliverables are targeted at proving resources for any Web services developer to create interoperable Web services, and verify that their results are compliant with both industry standards and WS-I recommended guidelines. The most important resources that will be provided are tools we refer to as a &#8216;sniffer&#8217; and an &#8216;analyzer&#8217;. The process used to develop these tools generates other useful implementation resources along the way. </font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Understanding what WS-I means by &quot;profiles&quot; is at the heart of understanding what WS-I is all about. WS-I does not itself set standards (in fact, one if its greatest frustrations is marketplace confusion on that point). In its own words, WS-I &quot;sits downstream&quot; from those who do set standards. What it does do is to review the standards of other organizations, and then encourage the adoption and implementation of what it considers to be the &quot;Baseline&quot; Web services standards available today (XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI). As Andy Astor, a WS-I board member and the Vice President for Enterprise Web Services of member webMethods, Inc., puts it, &quot; WS-I acts as a standards integrator, a role that is beyond the scope of any single standards organization. The organization&#8217;s founding is a response to the need to make standards even more relevant, even more quickly.&quot;</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By assembling collections of key web services standards into meaningful groupings, WS-I seeks to simplify implementation and promote interoperability. And having created these profiles, it can then embark on the creation of the other deliverables that make it more attractive for businesses to adopt these profiles. The desired end result: faster deployment of web services.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>All in the Family</em></strong>: Since WS-I does not set standards, maintaining effective relationships with relevant standard setting organizations is important. WS-I believes that it complements the work of standards organizations like W3C, Oasis, IETF and others. Necessarily, of course, there is the reality that if one assumes the right to anoint one specification over another, there is the potential for friction or conflict. Interestingly, while it maintains informal liaison relationships with many organizations, WS-I does not have formal relationships with any standard setting body.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in fact the multiple organizations involved in setting web services (and other web) standards must also work together cooperatively for the common good in order for web services standards to be useful and adopted. Adding an organization like WS-I into the mix simply adds a new dimension to a traditional and existing challenge. The substantial overlap in memberships (including at the Board level) between WS-I and the standard setting bodies most involved in setting web services standards provides the greatest force motivating productive collaboration. (For the results of interviews with WS-I, W3C and OASIS on how they fit together, see &quot;<a href="#featured">The Role of Web Services Standards Bodies: In Their Own Words</a>&quot;)</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Challenges:</em></strong> Unlike many new models of achieving interoperability, the web services concept has achieved buy-in from major vendors fairly quickly. With that success has come a different set of challenges. When asked what important forces are acting on WS-I today, Astor replied: &quot;The key force impacting WS-I today is that Web services are becoming mainstream, and their usage more common. As a result, the market is demanding technical standards and guidelines of increased depth (e.g., security, orchestration, and management), and to look for these items to be completed quickly. While WS-I is not a standards body, and does not invent new standards, it has needed to address these issues.&quot; </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One response to this challenge was the chartering in April of a Basic Security Profile Working Group. The BSPWG is charged with developing an interoperability profile involving transport security, SOAP messaging security and other security considerations implicated by the WS-I Basic Profile. The Basic Security Profile is intended to be an extension of the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0 and will reference existing specifications used to provide security, clarifications and guidance designed to promote interoperability of those specifications.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Astor identifies the following as the other major challenges facing the organization today:</font></p>
                        <div align="left">
                          <ul>
                            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Improving the membership balance between ISVs and end user organizations. Currently, vendors make up the majority of the membership, and more end user companies are needed to provide real-world examples of how web services are being used today. <br>
                            </font></li>
                            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Communicating to the market the value delivered by the adoption of the web services model of interoperability. <br>
                            </font></li>
                            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Timely delivery of WS-I's work product, since the organization must wait until standards are complete before it can produce its guidelines and recommendations. </font></li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, WS-I points with pride to a strong start, with a number of key deliverables already nearing completion, including working draft versions of the Basic Profile 1.0, Sample Applications and Testing Tools. It expects to make the final versions of these deliverables available this summer.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Summary: </em></strong>Dynamic markets require creative solutions. The increasing legitimacy of the consortium model, conjoined with its flexibility, lends itself to increasingly varied types of collaboration among both vertically and horizontally integrated collections of companies. As the varied use of the consortium model becomes ever more visible, it also becomes more frequently employed to solve problems that only a short time ago would have proven to be intractable. The business model for WS-I, and its rapid success in membership recruitment, provides an excellent example of how the consortium model is capable of playing a unique and important role in enabling the swift adoption of useful new business models.</font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were delighted by reaction to the article, which suggests that its appearance helped a number of organizations, as well as individual companies, recognize and more fully understand the scope and potential consequences of the Bill, as it would affect them and the standards setting community as a whole. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are especially pleased to report that the article initiated a dialogue with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), which has been actively involved in the Congressional initiative and the drafting of H.R. 1086. ANSI subsequently agreed to propose the inclusion of language addressing our concerns, regarding its potential to negatively impact consortia, in the report submitted by the House Judiciary Committee in connection with the Bill. The language, drafted by Lucash, Gesmer &amp; Updegrove, states that H.R. 1086 should not be interpreted to imply that consortia are not eligible for NCRPA coverage. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are grateful to ANSI for its cooperation in submitting this language for inclusion in the Committee report and pleased to partner with ANSI for the benefit of the entire standard-setting community. The House has not yet voted on H.R. 1086, and should the outcome be less than favorable, there will still be opportunities to influence debate when the Bill reaches the Senate floor. Standard setting is still a relatively new and unknown arena, but an extremely important and burgeoning one. While it has traditionally received little public or governmental attention, recently it has gained considerable attention by the media (Bluetooth, W3C, etc.), the Federal Courts (Rambus v. Infineon), the FTC (Rambus antitrust suit), and Congress (H.R. 1086). We encourage continued involvement by consortia and their members in encouraging Congress to act favorably toward standard setting in any industry-recognized venue.</font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On Tuesday May 20th, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ratified its new Patent Policy in a meeting in Budapest. The new policy governs the intellectual property protections of W3C's Internet technology standards with the expressed goal of ensuring that &quot;Recommendations produced under this policy can be implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis.&quot; (See link to W3C's policy below) The final draft of the policy, following several years of closely watched debate, may have a significant impact on the intellectual property rights policies of standard-setting organizations across the board. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new policy requires that participants in the development process of W3C standards and recommendations disclose patented assets and patent applications. Likewise, those viewing and reviewing technical drafts must also disclose knowledge of any applicable patents. The policy seeks to ensure that, aside from exception cases, standards and recommendations by the W3C can be implemented on a royalty-free basis. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The policy also outlines specific procedures to address the situation whereby a third party, unassociated with the W3C, unexpectedly discloses an applicable patent. According to the policy, each &quot;exception&quot; case will be investigated by a Patent Advisory Group (PAG) formed on an ad hoc basis in reaction to the specific issue. PAGs will include representatives of the W3C member companies involved in developing the specification, as well as legal staff representing the overall interests of the consortium, and may include legal staff representing member organizations. In investigating and resolving exception cases, a PAG may recommend legal analysis, alteration of specification elements to avoid royalty claims, consideration of licensing term alternatives, or abandonment of the work effort or of the specification if already issued.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new patent policy has been widely accepted and endorsed by W3Cs membership. It replaces a less defined policy that did not include adequate provisions to prevent royalty-bearing patent claims from inhibiting the development of interoperable Internet standards.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But finalizing the terms of the patent policy involved a process that took several years, often characterized by contentious debate. The W3C debate of royalty-free standards also evokes passion on both sides of the ongoing conflict between some software providers and open-source advocates. Software providers often stand to gain significant revenues from royalty-bearing patent claims. Open source communities, on the other hand, benefit from a development environment and technology that are open and accessible. W3C's new policy, which is built on a specific royalty-free basis but still includes provisions for exception cases, represents a compromise.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">W3C's closely watched and long anticipated patent policy reinforces the openness of the Internet by guaranteeing and firmly endorsing the desirability of royalty-free standards and recommendations. Mandating royalty-free standards and specifications is a bold step that could encourage other standard setting organizations who are seeing the implementation of their standards threatened by potentially prohibitive royalty claims.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Daniel Weitzner, W3C Technology and Society Domain Leader and chair of the Patent Policy Working Group, told an InternetNews.com reporter: &quot;For a number of members, [the vote] reflected substantive support for this policy. I think it also reflected a sense that this was certainly a hard-fought compromise. I think even for those members who might have preferred a different policy, they were willing to support this because they saw it was a policy that the entire consortium could live and work with.&quot; </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have consistently made a similar point to our consortium clients, in testimony in Washington, and at ConsortiumInfo.org (see <a href="/ipr/">http://www.consortiuminfo.org/ipr/</a>) that intellectual property policies must represent reasonable compromises in order to facilitate standards creation and adoption. Efforts by any single member, or group of members, to steer a policy to one extreme or another will inevitably undermine the ability of all members to achieve the goals for which the organization was formed.</font></p>
