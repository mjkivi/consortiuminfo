                  <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most people would agree that the World Wide Web Consortium (or the W3C, as it is universally referred to) is the organization by which all other consortia are measured. Despite earning such respect, it is not likely that anyone will ever precisely emulate it, due to its novel structure, varied work product and diverse interests. For example, while it has chosen not to pursue formal accreditation as an SDO (it refers to itself as an &#8220;international industry consortium&#8221;), it has all of the positive process attributes that people commonly associate with such a body. And while it is funded through significant corporate dues, it is hosted by three non-profits (the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science in the US, the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, headquartered in France, and Keio University in Japan). </font></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does it create? Go to its site, and you will find specifications, guidelines, software and tools. Who does it serve? While it has 450 member organizations that pay the bills, it also welcomes public participation and views itself as a custodian of a critical global resource. And finally: what is its mission? &#8220;W3C supports universal access, the semantic Web, trust, interoperability, evolvability, decentralization, and cooler multimedia&quot;. </font></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Got all that? All in all, a different sort of standard setting entity. Herewith, a brief profile of some of its more important attributes:</font></p>

                  <p align="left" class="style2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of which is not to say that the W3C has not had periods in the past where some found it to be less effective than it is today, or that everyone shares Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s current vision of a semantic web. Or that its rather dry website may not surprise first-time visitors (it more closely resembles the &#8220;engineers only&quot; web presence of its more low-profile cousin, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) than the virtual front door of most standards body sites). And finally, it is hardly immune from the commercial machinations of its own members, who (rightly) recognize the enormous commercial value that will arise from standards-based commercial opportunities, such as the advent of Web-based services.</font></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Be all of that as it may, it is always both interesting and necessary to pay close attention to what the W3C is up to. Sometimes it is easy to miss the important news that emanates from the organization, simply because there is so much activity that proceeds in so open and step-wise a fashion. W3C has a multi-stage technical development process, which includes public comment periods and releases of pre-commercial specifications for testing in the field. Even at the end of this process, rather than sounding the trumpets and announcing a &#8220;standard&#8221;, the W3C issues a &#8220;Recommendation&#8221;. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of this process is announced by means of releases and web pages (with abstracts), the language of which smacks more of a technical journal than classic public relations jargon. As a result of the large number of initiatives that are under way at any one time is a continuous stream of updates as numerous work projects progress through the various stages of the W3C process, morphing their way from ideas to final, implementable work product.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of this steady stream of status checks, we have decided in this issue to present a sampling of just some of the announcements issued by the W3C in the last 30 days, in order to give some insight into this unique organization &#8211; a month in the life of the World Wide Web Consortium. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the 30 days ending September 12, 2003 (in other words, while most people were finishing up their vacations, celebrating the last holiday weekend of the summer, and getting their children back to school), the W3C made 14 announcements, covering a wide variety of topics. Nine of those announcements reported on the advancement or release of 20 different technical process drafts, while one related to the release of completed work product (Amaya 8.1, a Web browser and authoring tool available in binary and source code form). Others reported on upcoming appearances by W3C staff at conferences and meetings, invited participation in a survey to determine the future course of a discontinued project (Libwww, a free, highly modular client side Web API written in C for Unix and Windows) and calling a meeting to discuss the fall-out from a crucial patent case impacting the Web.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All in a month&#8217;s work at the W3C. Here, in greater detail, are some of the more interesting announcements issued by this most interesting of standards organization.</font></p>

And even among those that do comprehend the concept are those that find it to be an unfortunate diversion for the W3C. Like so many visions that are scoffed at, however, this one is beginning to coalesce and become real (or virtually real, anyway). The following article focuses on the advancement of &quot;OWL&quot;, an ontology language and a crucial component of the Semantic Web, to &quot;Candidate Recommendation&quot; status by the W3C. CR status, the near-final stage in the multi-step process that permits a W3C specification to morph from concept to final &quot;Recommended&quot; status, means that the specification is regarded as being &quot;essentially stable&quot; and ready for implementation. The following article describes this latest development.</font></td>

    By Kendall Grant Clark <br>
    <strong>XML.com - August 20, 2003 </strong>-- Last year I wrote an article for XML.com, &quot;<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/05/01/webont.html" target="_off">If Ontology, Then Knowledge: Catching Up With WebOnt</a>&quot;, in which I introduced the W3C's web ontology language effort to the XML developer community. As a result of a long journey filled with hard work, the W3C's web ontology language, now called OWL, was advanced to W3C Candidate Recommendation on 19 August. While there is a lot of talk these days about the Semantic Web being the crack-addled pipe dream of a few academic naifs, in reality it's a lot closer to realization than you might be thinking. Now I want to be clear about this point: I'm not suggesting that we stand on the brink of a fully achieved, widespread Semantic Web. I am suggesting that some of the major pieces of the puzzle are now or will soon be in place. OWL, along with RDF, upon which it builds, are two such very major pieces of the Semantic Web puzzle..............<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/08/20/deviant.html" target="_off">Full Story</a> </font></p>

As such, the W3C represents an interesting evolutionary hybrid: a consortium that acts like an accredited standards development organization when it comes to achieving consensus -- but which also sets its own course rather than seeking accreditation.

This time, the retailer is seeking to facilitate the electronic exchange of &quot;paperwork&quot; using Electronic Data Interchange-Internet Integration, or EDI-INT, a protocol for moving data across the Internet that incorporates Extensible Markup Language (XML). Two aspects of this news are worthy of comment. The first, upon which the article focuses, demonstrates the profound economic impact that IT decisions made by the largest companies can have -- in this case, on the software marketplace, which will reap tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars in sales from vendor purchases motivated by the need to meet the new Wal-Mart requirement. The second aspect, however, is subtler: the ability of a single company to guarantee the broad utilization of a standard, as a result of its market power. Most standards initially struggle for acceptance, while companies haggle over the exact form of the specification and assess whether they will gain or lose from the uptake of the standard in its final form. But in a situation like this, the adoption by a single company with vast purchasing power can guarantee the broad use of a standard. It is at this point that the two aspects of the story touch: given the investment that multiple vendors will need to make in standards-compliant software to meet the requirements of this single customer, they will have a strong economic incentive to support its utilization by all of their customers. In this dynamic, we see the same result, in a more benign way, that results from the imposition of a proprietary, de facto standard from a vendor. But instead of a push from the top of the supply chain to the advantage of a single vendor, we see a pull from the opposite end, motivated simply by Wal-Mart's desire to use the most effective standard available to facilitate its operations and boost its profits. The result should be the rapid uptake of a standard to the ultimate benefit of all retailers that choose to follow in the wake of the retail giant. </em></font></td>
