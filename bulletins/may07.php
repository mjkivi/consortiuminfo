			<h4>EDITOR'S NOTE:</h4>
			<!-- <h3>STANDARDS AND THE ENVIRONMENT</h3> -->
			<h3>Standards and the Environment</h3>
			<p>Standards are valuable tools, but standing alone they are value neutral.</p>
			<p>That is to say, while public safety, the environment and other vital societal interests cannot be adequately protected without the use of standards, in and of themselves standards are simply objective measuring sticks. Absent an explanation of how a given standard relates to the big picture, it is only a collection of meaningless numbers and words.</p>
			<p>Today we are faced with extremely complex concerns involving the natural world. Many of these concerns are of our own making, and arise from our ongoing abuse of the environment. These threats include the impact of global warming, the depletion of natural resources and the prospect of accelerating species extinctions. Our ability to assess our success or failure in addressing each of these conditions will be dependent upon metrology &ndash; the science of measurement &ndash; and the use of standards. Using the first tool we can measure rates of change, and through the second, we can apply the limitations that need to be imposed in order to reverse those changes.</p>
			<p>I last wrote about standards and the environment in October of 2005, in an issue I called <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/oct05.php">Standards for a Small Planet</a>.  Since then, global warming has become universally accepted as a scientific reality, and evidence of its impact has become increasingly evident.  That impact has passed from the theoretical to the everyday, and the media is replete with news of the shrinking Arctic ice cap, melting permafrost throughout Alaska and Canada, and increasing desertification in China and elsewhere, among other changes with serious consequences.</p>
			<p>The advent this week of the annual Group of 8 talks is an appropriate time to revisit environmental issues of global scope, and I expect to write about the development and use of standards in connection with environmental and resource issues with increasing frequency in the future.  There is a great deal of important standards-related work being done in areas such as biofuels, alternative energy, and renewable resource management upon which to report, as well as much work that remains to be done.  </p>
			<p>But in this issue, I am taking a step upstream from the technical domain to address some of the larger questions that must be answered before real progress can be made in areas as challenging as global warming.  Questions such as where the political resolved will come from to impose limitations that may also impact economic growth, whether existing domestic and international governmental structures are adequate to enact and enforce such restrictions, and whether citizens will be willing to accept limitations on their way of life.</p>
			<p>I begin in my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong> by suggesting that we would have a healthier attitude towards natural resource usage if we thought of ourselves as merely tenants upon the land.  Perhaps we would be less heedless in our use and abuse of precious resources if we did not regard ourselves as their true owners.</p>
			<p>I expand on this property theme in this month's <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong>, by suggesting a radical way of reorienting our thinking about legal ownership rights.  While it would be naïve to expect that such a fundamental shift in laws could be enacted in practice, applying these changes in our thinking could lead us to be more willing to make the types of difficult and non-traditional decisions that may be necessary to address the otherwise intractable and serious problems we face today.  Those decisions will inevitably require a degree of international cooperation that has rarely been achieved in the past, and perhaps unprecedented cessions of national prerogatives as well.</p>
			<p>In my <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> selection for this month I depart from this issue's theme to provide some insight into one of the bigger technology stories in May: Microsoft's assertion, in a lengthy interview in Fortune Magazine, that it owns 235 patents that are infringed by Linux, OpenOffice and other important open source software, and its stated desire to use them to reap royalties from the marketplace.  The story is perhaps less significant in what it says about Microsoft's specific strategy than for what it reveals about the practical limitations that market realities impose today on the ability of a patent owner to assert its intellectual property rights. </p>
			<p>I conclude in my <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> piece with a meditation on property rights in some of the grandest resources of which we are stewards.  This issue came together in my mind as I walked among the redwoods of California's Big Basin State Park, as apt a place as one might find to think environmental thoughts.   It takes over four hundred years to produce a grove of mature redwoods.  But a property owner can condemn such a forest with the stroke of a pen.  96% of all old growth redwoods have already met this fate, and only 2.5% of those that remain are protected.  What rights, if any, may the wider world claim to preserve this species, based upon the common heritage we share in this unique and endangered resource? </p>
			<p>The next time you think of your children, and of your children's children, consider what our responsibilities regarding such natural resources should be. </p>
			<p>As always, I hope you enjoy this issue.</p>

			<!-- <h3>THE "LANDLORD'S MAN" AND THE CONSERVATION<br />OF NATURAL RESOURCES</h3> -->
			<h3>The &ldquo;Landlord&rsquo;s Man&rdquo; and the Conservation<br /> of Natural Resources</h3>
			<p class="center"><a href="http://www.lpu.com/attorneys/updegrove.shtml">Andrew Updegrove</a></p>
			<p>The most intimidating and intractable issue the leaders of the Group of 8 will face when they meet in Heiligandamm, Germany this week may well be global warming, a reality that even the United States government no longer disputes.  Absent from the meeting room will be China, which this year may surpass the United States as the world's most prolific emitter of greenhouse gases.</p>
			<p>In the days immediately preceding the meeting both the United States and China made significant statements on the issue: the Bush administration proposed a remedial plan that would lie outside the Kyoto Protocol framework already agreed to by virtually every nation in the world except the United States.  And China has adamantly rejected the ability of other nations to demand caps on the emissions of developing countries, including itself.</p>
			<p>China, of course, is not even a member of the Group of 8.  But the elephant in the meeting room will not so much be the inadequacy of the "first step" targets of the Kyoto protocol, or the refusal of the United States to ratify its participation in that accord, or even the absence of China at the table.  The real issue is the lack of any legal structure within which the nations of the world can address global resource issues with the authority and certainty that global warming demands.  </p>
			<p>The problem is two fold: structurally, there is no existing mechanism that can force any nation to constrain itself except through voluntarily entering into a treaty.  Nor is there usually a way to enforce treaty obligations that are not met.  Since the First World War and the subsequent failure of the League of Nations, governments consistently refused to compromise their sovereignty in favor of anticipatory, binding joint decision-making, instead of traditionally retroactive, elective ratification. </p>
			<p>The second leg of the problem has been recognized at least since the days of Aristotle, who recognized the following sad truth in his <em>Politics</em>: "that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it.  Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest, and only when he is himself concerned as an individual."</p>
			<p>Today, we refer to the manifestation of this human characteristic as the "tragedy of the commons."  Or, more starkly stated, the impulse to get it while you can, before the other guy takes it first.</p>
			<p>These two issues are inextricably linked, because by definition the tragedy of the commons cannot exist unless there are at least "two guys" that have the opportunity to exploit the same resource.  But if a resource with multiple, non-custodial owners is subject to the control of a single governing body, then there is hope.  Existing governmental dynamics, while imperfect, can be brought to bear to prevent over exploitation by multiple citizens.  If the competing resource exploiters are nations, however, then the common resource is placed at great risk.</p>
			<p>Consider, for example, the history of domestic environmental protection laws in the United States, in contrast to progress on global warming.  Air, water, and endangered species, among other commonly shared resources, are all now protected by strict laws, backed by severe (and often criminal) penalties.  What allowed effective action to follow public recognition of the gravity of these problems was the feasibility of collective action through a single guardian of the commons.</p>
			<p>It is true that progress has already been made on global warming through traditional mechanisms, both international (Kyoto) as well as private (many corporations are now adopting "green" policies independent of government requirements).  These efforts will likely continue and even increase.  But the urgent question remains whether such necessary actions will be sufficient.  In the fullness of time, if not our individual lifetimes, the output of green house gases must decrease on an absolute basis, rather than merely slow in growth on a relative basis.  Otherwise, dire consequences will only be delayed, rather than avoided.  In such an event, the "the other guys" that we beat to the commons will simply be our children, rather than ourselves.</p>
			<p>When referring to natural resources, it is fashionable to speak of ourselves as "holding them in trust" for future generations.  But this concept has been demonstrably  inadequate to protect resources from abuse, just as unsupervised trustees are too-often discovered in the real world to have violated their trust.</p>
			<p>One way to envision a solution is to consider ourselves to be not the owners, but simply the tenants, of the land we possess and the climate we share.  Tenants are required to maintain the leased premises in good condition, and may exercise only those rights that are expressly granted in the lease.  In the case of property with commercially valuable renewable resources, the lease terms invariably either bar the usage of such resources entirely, or prohibit their utilization in excess of sustainable levels.</p>
			<p>John Locke suggested that a similar approach should apply to natural resources held in common, recognizing an obligation to maintain "enough, and as good, left in common for others" after extracting one's own share of the common pie.</p>
			<p>The problem is not, of course, that the moral obligation proposed by Locke is disputed in principle. What is lacking is the means &ndash; and the common will - to abide by it in practice. Perhaps what is needed is the presence of another incident of the example of tenantry: that unpopular figure of the agrarian past, often referred to in history and literature simply as: &quot;the landlord's man.&quot;</p>
			<p>The landlord's man functions as the eyes and ears of the often-distant landlord.  The landlord of literature, of course, is the plutocrat that neither reaps nor sows, but nonetheless harvests a piece of the value created by the sweat of the farmer's brow.  The heartless absentee landowner cares not a whit for the welfare of the tenant, but only about the preservation of the value of his land.  The role of the landlord's man is not only to collect the rent, but also to preserve the intrinsic value of the landlord's land, cottages, hedgerows and, should the landlord be a sportsman, his foxes and fish as well.</p>
			<p>Perhaps what is needed today is an international landlord's man with the authority and (even) the coldness of the crofter's nemesis of yore.  Indeed, we would be better served if such an authority existed, and if that authority came from a global authority in which we were represented, but from which we could not withdraw.  Otherwise, the wastage of precious resources and the acceleration of global warming will go unchecked, and the property of the landlord will suffer great harm.</p>
			<p>That would be a common tragedy indeed. Because after all, we have met the landlord &ndash; and he is us.</p>

			<blockquote><em>'I can't believe that!' said Alice . 'Can't you?' the Queen said in a pitying tone. 'Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.' Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said. 'One can't believe impossible things.' 'I dare say you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.'</em></blockquote>

			<p>As I expect you are already aware, Fortune Magazine's Roger Parloff has authored an in-depth, and extremely well written, article called <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/index.htm">Microsoft Takes on the Free World</a>. ThThe article appeared on Sunday, and immediately unleashed a torrent of secondary commentary, interviews and analysis, and not a few blogging rants as well.</p>
			<p>But that doesn't automatically mean that they should take the statements at face value, and especially when they are so contradictory. For example, what does one make of the fact that Microsoft wants royalties, but doesn't want to sue anyone to get them?  And if Microsoft really believes that it has so many patents that are being infringed by Linux, why has it waited so long to assert them?  Given the differences between Linux and Windows, why has Microsoft never asserted any of its patents against the many other operating systems including Unix - that have existed over the years, each of which presumably infringed upon some subset (presumably major) of those same patents?</p>
			<p>Then there are the practical considerations: the fact that it would be infeasible for Microsoft to actually sue myriad vendors and customers; the fact that many of the its patents (perhaps most) would not stand scrutiny; that many distributors own patents that Microsoft is presumably infringing as well; the likely hostility that European regulators would have for such a gambit. And so on.</p>
			<p>As a result, I believe that the marketplace is rather rapidly going to come to the conclusion that the actual risk of anyone being sued by Microsoft on these patents &ndash;  ever &ndash; is, as scientists like to say, &quot;vanishingly small.&quot; One example of a well-written article (by IDG News Service's Elizabeth Montalbano) that heads in this direction is <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/05/14/Microsoft_patent_claims_hint_1.html">here</a>. IBM's Bob Sutor, at his Open Blog, provided a more concise commentary, brushing the Microsoft statements aside as "same old, same old". Bob's entire comment read as follows: <a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/">Again. How Tiresome.</a></p>
			<p>It's tempting to simply echo Bob's comment.  But perhaps it's useful to dig a bit deeper (this time in Q&amp;A form), and talk about what patents really mean in the world of high tech today &ndash; which isn't necessarily what you'd expect. But first, a disclosure: I provide legal counsel to the Linux Foundation and am on its Board of Directors (and before was counsel to and a Board member of the Free Standards Group), and I am also counsel to OASIS, the developer of ODF.  However, the opinions and statements below, as always, are mine and mine alone, and are not made on behalf of these or any other clients of mine.</p>
			<p>That said, let's get started. Let's talk about the patents first, for context.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think these patents relate to?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> We don't know, other than to the extent that Microsoft has disclosed its beliefs in that regard. According to Parloff's article: </p>
			<blockquote>[Microsoft licensing chief Horacio] Gutierrez refuses to identify specific patents or explain how they're being infringed, lest FOSS advocates start filing challenges to them. But he does break down the total number allegedly violated - 235 - into categories. He says that the Linux kernel - the deepest layer of the free operating system, which interacts most directly with the computer hardware - violates 42 Microsoft patents. The Linux graphical user interfaces - essentially, the way design elements like menus and toolbars are set up - run afoul of another 65, he claims. The Open Office suite of programs, which is analogous to Microsoft Office, infringes 45 more. E-mail programs infringe 15, while other assorted FOSS programs allegedly transgress 68 </blockquote>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> Those all sound like pretty old technologies and programs. Why the big deal now?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Glad you asked. Presumably there's nothing new at all, on the infringement side, or on the patent side. The only things that have changed are market conditions, which most notably include the threat to Microsoft's market share posed by the challengers noted. Don't forget that Linux is based on Unix, which has been around, for all practical purposes, forever. To the extent that patents on the important bits were filed, they would have been filed long ago by those that controlled Unix at the time. To the extent that they weren't made the subject of patents, they would constitute "prior art," and could be cited against the validity of any patents filed by Microsoft thereafter based upon the same inventions.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> Wouldn't a lot of these patents be getting to the end of their life as well?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Good point. Many presumably are, if they haven't expired already. As time goes on, more and more of the core functionalities will be up for grabs.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> So many other companies (IBM, Apple, and so on) have products and patents in each of those areas, too, don't they?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. And some of those companies have been filing patents at a far greater rate than Microsoft for decades. Presumably they have many patents that Microsoft's products would necessarily infringe. The graphical user interface for Windows, you may recall, was loosely based upon Apple products, and there was a big dispute between Apple and Microsoft over whether Microsoft had the rights to adopt its GUI. It claimed it acquired the rights under an existing license, not that it wasn't violating Apple's patents.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> Sure. You can't patent something that someone else has already patented, can you? So if these companies got there first, before Microsoft, then you could get the rights you needed to develop your software from them, right?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Bingo. And in fact, there are several projects already in existence to do just that. One is called the <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">Open Inventions Network</a>. It was formed (and invested in) by IBM, NEC, Novell, Philips, Red Hat and Sony in 2005. OIN's mission is to: </p>
			<blockquote>[R]efine the intellectual property model so that important patents are openly shared in a collaborative environment. Patents owned by Open Invention Network are available royalty-free to any company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against the Linux System. This enables companies to make significant corporate and capital expenditure investments in Linux &ndash;  helping to fuel economic growth.</blockquote>
			<p>Another effort to create a patent "safe haven" is the <a href="http://www.patentcommons.org/">Patent Commons</a>, which is hosted by the <a href="http://old.linux-foundation.org/about_osdl/legal/patent_commons">Linux Foundation</a>. Here's how it describes its mission: </p>
			<blockquote>The Patent Commons Project is dedicated to documenting the boundaries of The Commons -- a preserve where developers and users of software can innovate, collaborate, and access patent resources in an environment of enhanced safety, protected by pledges of support made by holders of software patents. Our Library is a central, neutral forum where patent pledges and other commitments can be readily accessed and easily understood</blockquote>
			<p>Yet another is the <a href="http://osapa.org/index.html">Open Source as Prior Art</a> project (which also receives support from the Linux Foundation). Together, these efforts are directed at defining, expanding, protecting and maintaining a patent "safe haven" within which open source software development and use can take place.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> But if Microsoft has patents that really would be infringed, why doesn't it just come out and cite them?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> There are two reasons that people always talk about, and a third one that in this case really matters. Let's briefly review them.</p>
			<p>The first one is that once you name a patent and say someone else is infringing it, then if you sue them and win, they can be held liable for treble damages &ndash; roughly speaking, three times the value of your lost sales after you put them on notice of their violation. That would make you think that Microsoft would want to name the patents immediately, wouldn't it?</p>
			<p>The second reason, though, is that once a patent owner does name the specific patent claims it says you are infringing, you can go to court, and ask the court to determine whether those claims were validly issued or not.  As you saw above, there are a lot of companies that are willing to invest time and money in protecting Linux and other open source software.  So as soon as Microsoft named a patent, those companies could, if they wished, go to court (or subsidize someone else to go to court) and try to kill it.  They could also start changing the software to try and "design around" the infringement.</p>
			<p>But the third reason, as we'll discuss at greater length below, is that the patents don't really matter very much anymore anyway, except for the "Air Wars" (a/ka/ FUD) value of making people worry about infringement. </p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> All right, so I think I'm getting the picture. Operating systems and productivity software have been around for a long, long time, and many companies have patents in these areas. So, probably no single company &ndash; even Microsoft - could safely build products in any of these areas without infringing the patents of other companies. If that's true, how do they do it? Do patents mean anything at all any more?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Ah &ndash; that's the question, isn't it? And that brings us to the point where we need to follow Brad Smith as he steps through the looking glass to try and figure out what's really going on here. You'll notice that in the <em>Fortune</em> article, Smith says that Microsoft decided that pursuing cross licenses was the route they decided to take, after considering whether to start suing people, or just throwing in the towel.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yes, I remember that. So what's cross licensing all about?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> A cross license is what two different companies enter into when they both have something the other wants.  In this case, that would be the patents underlying the same products.  Cross licenses can be limited (to a single small set of patents), or domain specific (e.g., relating to a single product type), or they can even be company-wide.  There is a vast, invisible web of patent cross licenses of all types that run everywhere throughout the technology industry. </p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do they come about?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Sometimes they are arrived at peacefully. For example, standard setting is in part basically an exercise in cross licensing, to the extent necessary to permit a standard to reach the marketplace on acceptable terms to adopters. And sometimes they are the result of truces that follow years of head bashing, and involve large payments to settle outstanding litigation. If you think about it, you'll recall reading about these from time to time. An example is the rapprochement reached between <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/apr04/04-02SunAgreementPR.mspx">Microsoft and Sun</a> in 2004. They buried the hatchet in many areas with that agreement, while reserving their independence to compete in other areas.</p>
			<p><strong>Q.</strong> Got it. So let's get a bit more specific. What's going on with the new Microsoft announcement? What are they focusing on? What are they trying to achieve?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Sorry &ndash; I've got to do a bit more explaining first. When you get to this level of activity, you have to think of what's going on as international diplomacy, not just commercial activity. The stakes are huge, the number of players is enormous, and everything is interlocked. You can't just charge around like a bull in a China shop, no matter how big a bull you are.</p>
			<p>Like diplomacy, you're also dealing in perceptions as much as with facts. If Microsoft really did have killer patents, the usual thing would be to pick out a few small targets and sue them, overwhelming them with your legal assault, spending them into the ground. If you're feeling insecure about your patent, you might settle quickly, asking for a very low royalty - or even no royalty at all - from the "infringer."  As part of the settlement, the little company agrees not to disclose terms.  Then, of course, you announce to the world that you've "won," and that your patent has been tested and stood up to the challenge.</p>
			<p>Next, you point to that victory to intimidate others into paying you royalties as well.  If the royalties you ask for aren't too high, many will simply agree to pay up rather than risk being sued.  And note that it only takes a single patent claim to block someone from selling a product, unless it pays up. The most famous example of this strategy is the Lemelson series of bar code patents, which reaped more than $1.5 billion in royalties over a period of many years before two companies, Cognex and Symbol Technologies, finally decided that they weren't going to knuckle under.  They went to court to challenge the Lemelson patents, and refused to settle.  The court found that Lemelson had improperly extended the patent filings before asserting them as "submarine patents," and that some of them should never have been issued to begin with.  Cognex rightly claimed a  <a href="http://www.cognex.com/news/press_releases/2004/Cognex_Lemelson.asp">great victory</a> for the marketplace.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> Good for them!  But why isn't Microsoft suing a few little guys here? With that many patents, surely you'd think they would have a few good ones, right?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Ah - but maybe that doesn't even matter.  Let's assume that Microsoft has existing cross licenses with many of the companies that are promoting Linux (it does).  Let's also suppose that many of those cross licenses cover operating systems and office productivity software (I don't know that this is true, but I assume it must be).  Now who do you sue?  If you decided to sue a few little guys, how would you prevent one of the big guys with cross licenses from simply granting a license to the targets you picked?  And how about if some of those cross licenses were up for renewal, or you wanted to expand them?  How much do you want to incense the owner of the patents that you need access to?  Finally, even for big companies, the costs of patent infringement lawsuits are huge, the results uncertain, and the time between filing suit and finally winning (or losing) is <em>very</em> long.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> So big companies don't actually have that much freedom to use their patents to exclude competition, do they?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Exactly. In fact, patents today among the Big Boys are a sort of barter commodity, rather than singular weapons. Or you can think of them as Carbon Credits &ndash; something that you move around to make your life easier while continuing with business as usual.</p>
			<p>In this sense, then, the much greater value of patents is defensive and not offensive - you get them to preserve your freedom of strategy and movement. Sophisticated companies now largely take this view.  They have patents so that other companies can't stop them from doing what they want to do, not so that they can stop other companies from doing what they don't want them to do. Starting to get the Looking Glass part now?</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> I think so. So we've turned the system upside down and inside out: I don't get a patent to create a monopoly, but to prevent you from creating one, right?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> You're catching on much faster than Alice. That's it exactly. Once a patent "thicket" have developed in a product area, where everyone owns some patents, no one can stop everyone else from selling products there. All you can do is negotiate terms.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> Got it. So can we get back to Microsoft now?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Grasshopper, you are now ready to receive enlightenment.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> Please...</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Sorry.  The Q&amp;A format just went to my head  So let's look at what's actually been going on.  Microsoft has announced three Linux cross license deals so far: with Novell, Dell and Samsung.  In each case, it's refused to reveal the terms.  It's also refused to identify the patents.  So we're looking at a black box, where we don't know what value, if any, is actually being paid to Microsoft in exchange for Microsoft agreeing to cross license rights in operating system software. </p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> The Novell deal does look awfully one-sided. Most of the cash seems to be going to Novell, not the other way around.</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes indeed. The Fortune article says Microsoft explains this by saying that Novell has valuable network computing patents that Microsoft patents may infringe, and since Microsoft sells so much more than Novell, it needs to pay more. But Novell has been moving away from its network computing business for years, and Microsoft hasn't (to my knowledge) announced anything new in this area that would create an urgent demand for access to such patents. Why did those patents suddenly become so valuable to Microsoft right now? </p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> So we don't know what value each party is actually placing on the Microsoft patents?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> None at all. Cross licenses often cover an incredible range of activities that can go far beyond simple patent licensing. Look at all the territory that the Novell-Microsoft pact covers. Or go look more closely at the old Microsoft-Sun agreement I linked to above: it settled litigation, set the stage for technical collaboration, included Microsoft support for Java, Windows certification for Sun servers, and much more. As you can see, patents can be just the nominal invitation to the party, and the public announcements cover only what you want the world to know &ndash; or, more to the point, what you want the world to think.</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> OK, so boil all this down for me, would you?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> I'll try. Here's what I think the <em>Fortune</em> article, and Microsoft's statements, really mean: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Microsoft has said it won't sue customers. That's good, and makes sense. So customers can rest easy.</li>
				<li>Microsoft probably can't sue many of the companies it needs to worry about most, because existing cross licenses with those companies would prevent it. Note that Microsoft hasn't said a word about its patents being infringed by AIX or Solaris, for example.   These cross licenses would presumably protect Linux distributions offered by the same vendors as well. </li>
				<li>The agreements that Microsoft has already signed with customers and distributors may assign little, if any, value to the patents. It's possible that the value actually went in the other direction, with Microsoft paying more to get the other party to agree to include public mention of open source patent licensing at all. </li>
				<li>Microsoft is clearly feeling threatened. It's no coincidence, to my mind, that it has suddenly linked OpenOffice with Linux in this story. Windows and Office provide the lion's share of Microsoft's revenues and profits, and it needs to defend them with everything it's got. </li>
				<li>Within the next week or so, the industry will be treating this as "so what" news. Lots of journalists and bloggers already are.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> So has anything really changed?</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong>  To my mind, not much at all. Going back to my diplomacy analogy, it's like the US moving another carrier group into the Persian Gulf when things get hot, to let the local regimes know that it's keeping a close eye on things. Is it going to attack? No. It's just signaling.</p>
			<p>But I think that in this case, Microsoft may be making a miss step. By focusing so much attention on this issue, it causes more articles &ndash; like this one &ndash; to be written to dispel the FUD. And it spawns more patent-focused efforts like those noted above to support open source software development and use. The result is that instead of cowing the little people, it helps pull back the curtain.</p>
			<p>And then you find that all-powerful Oz (and his patent portfolio) doesn't look so all powerful, after all.</p>

			<!-- <h3><span class="red">#49</span> WALKING  AMONG  GREAT  TREES:  A  MEDITATION  ON  HERITAGE</h3> -->
			<h3><span class="red">#49</span> Walking Among Great Trees: A Meditation on Heritage</h3>
			<p>Heritage is an interesting concept.  It includes perceptions of both past and present, and shared as well as individual experience.  The boundaries of heritage are elastic, comprehending anything and everything that, taken together, contributes to who and what we feel we are.  </p>
			<img class="imgright" src="/images/csb_200705_redwoods_A.jpg" alt="Redwood Trees" width="208" height="277" border="0" />
			<p>For most, the concept of heritage includes elements as disparate as the national ideals held by our forebears, our common literary and artistic heritage, and the great cities, architectural icons, and natural wonders of our nations.  Our perceptions of heritage help bind us to our families, our neighbors and our fellow countrymen, each in a different way.  But in each case, the tie that binds us together is our shared values, experiences and reference points.  In a real sense, it is how we tell "us" from "them."  And in consequence, each of us has a sense that we have some sort of inchoate claim of ownership upon the tangible as well as the intangible things that by their connotations have somehow become part of our heritage. </p>
			<p>These feelings are so universal, and arise so naturally, that they seem incontestable.  But if they are so obvious, why do we not have legal rights in our "heritage?"  How is it, then, that the wrecker's ball, the developer's bulldozer, and the logger's skidder can take away something in a day that we have taken for granted for a lifetime?</p>
			<p>How indeed?  And is this as it should be?  When something treasured is lost, questions occur to us, such as whether the laws should change to better prevent the loss of our heritage the next time around.  But as quickly may occur another concern: what protections should there be for those that have traditional legal rights in the same property?   </p>
			<p>The elements of heritage can take many forms.  They can be intangible, such as our history, and therefore subject to the ownership claims of no one.  Or they can be owned by individuals but widely available, such as works of literature still under the protection of copyright. Or they can be in the physical possession of individuals that reserve them for their personal enjoyment (such as a great painting that passes from a museum into private ownership).</p>
			<img class="imgright" src="/images/csb_200705_redwoods_B.jpg" alt="Redwood Trees" width="208" height="277" border="0" />
			<p>I find the relationship between heritage and property rights to be both interesting and important, in part because the validity of a communal claim that is widely felt can at the same time have no legal basis, and therefore no  protection, at all.  Unlike most property rights that inevitably find their way into statutes, heritage rights to tangible property of value are more honored in the breach, either by outright donation to trusts by the title owners of the property in question, or through purchase by non-profits or the government itself.  In each case, no one needs to explain why such a transaction should occur, even in the case of the expenditure of public or tax-exempt funds to secure the property for common enjoyment or protection.</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, because tangible elements of heritage can have great value, there is tension between their status as property subject to individual ownership, and the rights of others that feel a close personal attachment, and even a shared entitlement, to that property.  The sphere of those that feel so entitled can be very large and even surprising as well, especially when the property in question is threatened.  </p>
			<p>Recall, for example, the global outcry when the Taliban in Afghanistan threatened to blow up, and then did destroy, the monumental Buddhas of Bamyan in 2001.  Those on the other side of the world, from other cultures and practicing other religions, could hardly claim any individual or national rights in such statues in any national, let alone traditional property sense.  But the sense of shock, anger and loss was palpable for many that felt that in some way their lives and, for want of a better word, their heritage had been violated.   The best explanation for such a widely felt reaction may be that the more precious and incredible the work of art or architecture at risk, the more likely we are to feel that somehow the icon in question is inextricably tied up in the reality of who we are.  Or perhaps because it reveals what humans have been capable of accomplishing in the past, and therefore provides hope that much can still be expected from us in the future, however dreary the evening news.</p>
			<p>So also it is with natural wonders as well.  Millions of Americans visit natural wonders such as the rain forests of Costa Rica and the Great Barrier Reef of Australia every year.  There is even a word for such travels now:  "ecotourism."  Despite the location of these natural treasures beyond our national boundaries, we would find it no more acceptable for our ability to experience their beauty to be withdrawn than would Europeans accept a decision by our government to reserve the Grand Canyon for the appreciation of Americans alone.</p>
			<img class="imgright" src="/images/csb_200705_redwoods_C.jpg" alt="Redwood Trees" width="208" height="277" border="0" />
			<p>I have said that the law does not recognize heritage rights, but this is not completely true.  There is an emerging recognition that even if such rights do not exist in a legal sense as claims superior to the owners of property, there should nonetheless be a means by which heritage rights can be recognized and secured for the public benefit.  Nationally, laws such as the Antiquities Act of 1906, signed into law in the United States by President Theodore Roosevelt, permit a president to set aside public lands as National Monuments, in order to protect antiquities and other resources.  </p>
			<p>The concept of a global heritage in both natural as well as architectural resources has also been recognized, through the creation of the <em>Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage</em>, which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_16">16 November</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972">1972</a>.  Today, over 180 nations are party to this agreement, and as of 2006, over 830 cultural, natural and mixed sites had been granted status under the treaty as "World Heritage Sites."    </p>
			<p>Perhaps the most interesting and important legal aspect of this treaty is that it implicitly recognizes that we have a moral duty to generations unborn.  Given the propensity of those living today to exhaust finite resources and emit greenhouse gases as if there was (literally) no tomorrow, we may ultimately come to believe that those not yet born have real legal rights, and not just moral entitlements.  Perhaps we may even conclude that our descendents, like orphaned minor children, are in need of a court-appointed guardian to protect their patrimony.  </p>
			<p>For now, though, the ability to conserve heritage sites in most countries depends upon the willingness of owners to cooperate with conservation efforts.  Property owners who are otherwise sympathetic but not disposed (or financially able) to make charitable donations have therefore been compensated for the lost value of the restrictions placed upon their properties.  As a result, many worthy sites have been preserved, sometimes from government action.  But by no means all treasures have been saved.  After all, while the Grand Canyon continues to amaze us, equally spectacular vistas just upstream on the Colorado River were lost to view when the Glen Canyon Dam was built, creating Lake Powell.  Hard though it now may be to believe, the Grand Canyon itself narrowly escaped the same fate.  And indeed, the treaty that created the World Heritage Site process arose from the intent of Egypt to flood countless Egyptian antiquities through construction of the Aswan High Dam.  Only through an international funding and engineering effort, monumental in its own right, were a significant number of these treasures saved. </p>

			<div class="right"></div>
			<p>But what if an owner is not disposed to cooperate? Does a canyon here or a forest there, more or less, make a difference? And if so, where does one draw the line? Property rights are understandably precious, and the sanctity of land ownership is part of our heritage as well. The world over, attachments to the land are fierce, and the very ability to survive can be inextricably linked to the possession of even a few acres. Popular movements in some developing nations continue to wrestle with entrenched oligarchies, seeking the redistribution of land to the poor. And in years past, countless millions of (mostly) Europeans left all &ndash; including much of their own heritage &ndash; behind to seek land in the Americas.</p>
			<p>Where then, do we find the balance?  Where is the dividing line between the heritage rights of the many, and the property rights of the few?</p>
			<p>Perhaps the best place to look for answers may be in a quiet place.  Perhaps a walk in the woods the place to consider such questions, as I did recently.  Not just any woods, or course, but a woods conducive to thinking deep thoughts about our heritage in the natural world.</p>
			<p>One such forest can be found in California's <a href="http://www.bigbasin.org/">Big Basin State Park</a>, which was created in 1902 by those concerned over the rampant logging of old growth Redwood groves.  Through progressive purchases, it now comprises over 18,000 acres of Redwood forest and other habitat, and includes the largest continuous stand of these great trees south of San Francisco.  That city is only a short drive away, and the park offers over 80 miles of trails to those seeking an oasis of tranquility and transcendent natural beauty to relieve the strains of modern life.</p>				<p>A Redwood grove is a place of stillness.  Winds do not reach the forest floor, nor much direct light.  Only the quiet clicking of insects filters down, and the occasional distant squawk of a Steller's Jay, offended by some unseen intruder.  At intervals, narrow streamlets trickle silently and sinuously through the accumulated forest debris, barely cutting into the alluvial soils beneath.</p>
			<p>In the near distance overhead, an understory of tan oak and shrubbier trees, none thicker than your leg, scatter their branches.  That sparce tracery is dappled by what little light penetrates the redwood canopy far above, and in turn dapples with shadow the occasional glade below.  And everywhere, in groups of five, ten, or a hundred, stand the enormous columns of the great trees themselves.  </p>
			<p>The trunk of each redwood has a character all its own.  Some are striated with near-parallel ribs of thick, protective bark.  The bases of others seem cramped by gnarled, encirlcing tendons, resembling great and ancient hands that have seen too long a lifetime of hard use.  Others sport neat nets of interlacing lines spreading at the base, and narrowing into orderly, parallel lines as they ascend.  Some trunks are grey; others reddish brown.  Where lightning has sparked a fire, they may sport a tortoise shell pattern of charred black on brown, reminscent of circular, printers' woodblocks, already inked and ready to roll their images upon some enormous unseen surface, recording the price of their survival.</p>
			<p>Mature Redwoods rise eighty or a hundred feet before spreading their first branch.  Then the trunks vanish into the canopy of proliferating greenery, attaining a height that can only be guessed.  Except, that is, when your trail strikes a diagonal up the side of one of the deep, fog-filled ravines in which Redwoods thrive, nurtured by the moisture wafted in from the sea and protected from the wind through most of their height by the ridges that enfold them.  On such a trail, you can sometimes appreciate the full grandeur of a Redwood, as you look both  down and up from your vantage point.  More than a hundred and fifty feet in each direction, perhaps, you can at last glimpse the giant from base to crown.</p>
			<p>Redwoods and their close cousins, the Giant Sequoias, may lay claim to being some of the only living things that never die of simple old age.   Instead, they are ultimately rent by lighting or overthrown by the wind.  Or they simply fall, when their incredible mass proves too much for the superficial root system that strives for purchase in the shallow soils in which the redwoods grow.   </p>
			<p>When they do meet their end, they begin a long and gentle progress of return to the earth.  At first, they may stand awhile as tilted snags, supported by their neighbors.  But after a period of days or years they inevitablycomplete their downward journey.  The largest startle in their enormity, looking vastly larger in the horizontal, in full view, than ever they could rising vertically into the pervasive canopy above.  Over time, a fallen tree literally sinks into the earth, its hollowed, shattered end sometimes emerging at an angle for a time, extending like the savage jaws of some monstrous sea creature of the Silurian age.  Along the backs of many fallen trees sprout lines of saplings, rooted in the fog-dripped moss that grows wetly on their bark.  Centuries on, the straight line laid out by seedlings that survive will mark the resting place of the nurse tree that in death nurtured them from their birth.</p>
			<p>Today, less than 4% of the old growth Redwoods survive that astonished the first white explorers. And a scant 2.5% of this 4% is protected from logging. That small number of acres is itself subject to natural dangers, including storms, fire, and the floods that can be magnified in intensity by the increased runoff from logged over areas uphill &ndash; which sometimes has eradicated entire coastal groves. Some remaining forests are too small to remain viable in the long term. The accelerating fragmentation of the groves that remain also lessens the long-term survival likelihood of the fauna that call these unique ecosystems home</p>
			<p>The ready accessibility of magnificent groves of trees, such as the Big Basin forest, and the far smaller John Muir forest north of San Francisco, create a false sense of security, as does the enormity of the trees themselves.  How could such impregnable giants, lying within state and national parks, be endangered?</p>
			<img class="imgright" src="/images/csb_200705_redwoods_G.jpg" alt="Redwood Trees" width="208" height="277" border="0" />
			<p>And yet they are.  Consider the following somber assessment, from the <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/na/na0519_full.html">World Wildlife Organization Web site:</a></p>
			<blockquote>Redwood National Park is the only hope for survival of functioning Redwood ecosystems, yet even this is questionable given their size and surrounding land use. Jedediah Smith and Del Norte Redwood State Parks are two smaller reserves. Muir Woods and Big Basin towards the south are too small for realistic prospects of long-term conservation of this unique community...</blockquote>
			<blockquote>The last Redwood groves on private land, mostly in the Headwater Forest area near the van Duzan River, are under imminent threat of cutting by Pacific Lumber. Compromising agreements between State and Federal agencies and this company leave in doubt the survival of these last remnants. It is unfathomable with the knowledge and resources we have today that there would be any question of total protection of the last remaining groves of these globally unique ecosystems, and unconscionable that the government and citizens of this country have let the destruction continue to this point.</blockquote>
			<p>And so we return to the central question of what is to be done.  How do we balance the rights of the property owner to its property and the right of future generations to walk among the Redwoods?  </p>
			<p>One way to respond to that question might be to answer this one: how would you explain to a grandchild what it was like to walk among the Redwoods, and also why they would never be able to so as well?   </p>
			<p>How much better to look forward to sharing this precious heritage with the same child, and witness the first dawning wonder reflected in her shining eyes?</p>

			<h3>Global Standard Setting 2007: An Interactive Discussion</h3>
			<p class="center"><strong>Hosted by Gesmer Updegrove LLP</strong><br />40 Broad Street, Third Floor<br />Boston, MA 02109<br />617-350-6800</p>
			<p class="center"><strong>June 20, 2007, 8:30 am</strong> &ndash; <strong>4:00 pm</strong></p>
			<p>On June 20, the third in a series of annual events focused on bringing together leaders of both accredited and non-accredited standards developers will be held, sponsored by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  </p>
			<p>ANSI represents U.S. interests in a number of important global standards organizations, and accredits those traditional standards development organizations (SDOs) that are formed to primarily benefit U.S. interests. Consortia, on the other hand, are not accredited by any national or international authority, and seek to set global standards, and many are headquartered in the United States.  Since SDOs are formed to represent national interests, while consortia are created to serve the interests of an international membership, the paths of these two communities cross constantly in the trenches, but almost never in a formal fashion, except through the many one-on-one liaison relationships established between SDOs and consortia that address the same or adjacent technical areas. </p>
			<p>Despite these differences, SDOs and consortia have far much in common, including the fact that their memberships characteristically overlap heavily.  They also share common concerns relating to intellectual property rights management, governance, member recruitment and retention, and promotion of their work product.  At the same time, each has competencies that the other usually lacks, and experience that its peers of both types could benefit from sharing.  The goal of this year's event will be to not only gain from another exchange of ideas, but also to explore avenues for ongoing communication in a more structured and frequent basis.</p>
			<p>This year's event has been designed to be highly interactive, and will feature brief panel presentations analyzing problems faced by all types of standard setting organizations (SSOs), followed by lengthier, facilitated discussions involving all attendees.  A final discussion period has been set aside to discuss ways in which consortia and accredited organizations can engage more frequently and productively to address matters of common concern.</p>
			<p><strong>Attendance: </strong> Participation is limited to senior management, Board members and other qualified representatives of both accredited and non-accredited SSOs, to ensure a high-level peer-to-peer exchange of issues and ideas.  There is no charge to attend, but space is limited and will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
			<p><strong>Invitations:</strong> If you would like to attend this meeting, please register at <a href="https://eseries.ansi.org/source/Events/Event.cfm?EVENT=OPEN_F_07&Section=Meetings">this address</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Location:</strong> 40 Broad Street, Boston (ten minutes from Logan Airport and South Station). </p>
			<p><strong>Agenda:</strong> The agenda for the event is under continuing development and subject to changes.</p>
