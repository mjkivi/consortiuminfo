                      <br>
                      STANDARDS INFRASTRUCTURE  -  SUCCEED?
</strong></p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Each year, more and more  consortia are created to develop and support standards, with formations  outpacing dissolutions and mergers.&nbsp;  Some of the new organizations become significant contributors to the  standard setting ecosystem, while others are intended to play only a minor  part.&nbsp; Others never succeed at all.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Last month I focused on how  to select the most effective consortium to join out of the many that are  available.&nbsp; This month, I've written  about how to create a successful consortium, and what the continuing proliferation  of such organizations means for the overall effectiveness of the standard  setting infrastructure.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">I begin this issue in my <strong><em>Editorial</em></strong> from a different perspective, however, focusing not on what consortia do well,  but on what they do not: cooperate in a comprehensive, well-considered fashion  with other consortia, and with the accredited standards development  organizations that are part of a more integrated and hierarchical global  infrastructure.&nbsp; That system has its own  disadvantages, but also its virtues.&nbsp; It  is my belief that the members of each type of organization would benefit if  there were greater communication and coordination among all types of standards  development and standards supporting organizations, both consortia and  accredited alike.&nbsp; A new American  National Standards Institute (ANSI) working group that I'm chairing is  exploring how that might be brought about.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">In the <strong><em>Feature Article</em></strong> this month, I provide the first of a two-part series on how to form a  successful consortium to develop and/or promote standards.&nbsp; In this first installment, I talk about  practical matters such as scope, membership structure and process.&nbsp; In the next issue, I'll describe how to best  create and support such a consortium from the legal perspective.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Of course, there's more to maximizing the system than simply improving communications, and non-profit organizations can be as competitive as their for-profit analogues.&nbsp;  As a result, the <strong><em>Standards Blog</em></strong> entry that  I've selected for this month focuses on what happens when different players in  the standards ecosystem push and pull rather than collaborate, fueled in this  case by political tensions between the United States and other countries  relating to Internet governance.&nbsp; In a  better-coordinated system, SSOs would spend their time addressing and resolving the  underlying issues, rather than  seeking to take advantage of them, as may be  the case in this &quot;Internet Case of Cat and Mouse.&quot;</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">As usual, I take a less  serious approach in my <strong><em>Consider This</em></strong> essay, which illustrates how  the world of sports mimics the world of standards.&nbsp; Sports?&nbsp; As you'll see, sports  of all types relie heavily on developing, utilizing and enforcing compliance  with their own versions of standards in order to enable competitive play, and  sometimes ongoing innovation as well.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">You'll notice that this  month, as last month, I have omitted the <strong><em>Rest of the News</em></strong> feature.&nbsp; Doing so significantly reduces  the time spent in producing each issue, and the same news (and much more) is  posted on a daily basis at both the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/">Standards News Portal</a> section of  the ConsortiumInfo.org Website as well as in the right hand column of the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/">Standards Blog</a>.&nbsp; If you miss this feature in the Consortium  Standards Bulletin, please let me know, and I'll consider restoring it.</p>
                  <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, since December is  one of the two months that I turn my writing attention to other projects, look  for your next issue in January of the New Year.</p>

              <p align="center" class="style10"><strong> <strong> </strong>CONSORTIUM PROLIFERATION  -  TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?</strong></p>
              <p align="center" class="style10"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a></strong></font></p>
              <p align="center" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">By my  count, no fewer than 45 new consortia have been formed to date in 2006.&nbsp; To my knowledge, only a much smaller number  of standard setting and promotional consortia have dissolved, ceased active  operations or merged into other organizations.&nbsp;  The result is that the ranks of the many hundreds of consortia already in  existence continue to swell.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">That's a  good thing, in that each of these new organizations was obviously formed to do  what its founders deemed to be important work.&nbsp;  And it's also good news, because it indicates that the technology sector  continues to innovate and move aggressively into new areas of endeavor that  require standards.&nbsp; I see multiple new  organizations, for example, in each of the following categories:&nbsp; RFID, security (in many contexts), payment  and credit card technology, wireless,&nbsp;  mobile services, digital television and radio, Ethernet, and more. </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Its also  good news that the very flexible consortium concept has proved to be so  adaptable and durable, allowing new initiatives to be rapidly deployed when  needed to accomplish what needs to be done.&nbsp;  After all, that's one of the reasons that consortia first began to  multiply in the IT sector some twenty years ago, breaking out of the  traditional system of nationally-based, accredited standards development  organizations (SDOs) that had evolved over the preceding hundred years.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">But there's  an unfortunate side to the proliferation of consortia as well, because the same  light-weight approach that permits consortia to be created and launched cheaply  and quickly does not provide well for the types of communication and  collaboration that the accredited world of standard setting was designed to  provide, and up a point achieves.&nbsp; Nor  do the strategic plans of most consortia include all of the activities that  their accredited brethren often pursue, such as public advocacy, and support in  international trade matters.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Instead,  the ties among consortia, and among consortia and SDOs, are more ad hoc than  systemically conceived.&nbsp; Individual  consortia and SDOs form liaison relationships as needed that form single points  of contact on a one-on-one basis, but these networks of contacts work only as  well as the individuals deployed to maintain them, and each  network operates largely in isolation from every other network, with each  overlaying, rather than supplementing, the other.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Consortia  are also ill-equipped to assist their members in more peripheral, but still  important challenges in successfully selling standards-based products.&nbsp; Consortia are typically low budget and  lightly staffed, and their managements are usually more than fully occupied  executing on their core missions of standard setting, recruitment and  promotion.&nbsp; Adding certification and  branding to the mix is often necessary and adds additional burdens to the mix.&nbsp; As a result, becoming knowledgeable about  international conformity testing requirements on a country by country basis  goes well beyond the time and competency resources of almost all consortia,  although many SDOs would provide assistance in these and other international  trade areas to their members.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">And  while  standards can, and increasingly are, submitted by consortia to ISO/IEC for adoption, many consortia are unfamiliar with the process or methodology for  such consideration.&nbsp; When a consortium's members  suggest for the first time that a given standard should be offered to ISO through the PAS process,  management must embark on a venture into what is often alien territory.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In some  ways, the coexistence of consortia and SDOs resembles two different cultures  living side by side in the same country, each maintaining a polite distance from the other  and rarely intermingling, even though each could gain much from coordinating  more closely with the other.&nbsp; In both  cases, such a state of artificial separation breeds misunderstanding and counter  productive behavior, rather than cooperation.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">One  reason for this state of affairs is that the majority of information and  technology consortia have been organized, and continue to be headquartered, in  the United States.&nbsp; Most also have more  U.S.-headquartered members than members from any other nation or region.&nbsp; As a result, consortia take pains not to appear to be too U.S.-centric, given that their goal is to set  global standards.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">Still,  the U.S. remains (at least for now) the largest market for IT products and  services, and what Congress does, and does not- do, can have a major impact on  the businesses of all consortium members, wherever they may be.&nbsp; But few consortia (unlike many of their accredited  peers) have the related resources or staff competency to be active in informing  Congress about the standards-related needs of their industries.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">In the  accredited world, many of the issues mentioned above would be met or  facilitated by the national organizations that accredit their domestic standard  setting organizations (in the United States, the American National Standards  Institute, or ANSI (of which I am a director), fulfills this role).&nbsp;&nbsp; These organizations, and many individual  SDOs, participate internationally in activities organized by ISO and the IEC,  and nations participate together in the ITU.&nbsp;  Consortia, no matter how large and influential they may become, remain  largely outside these processes, and in any event are relegated to spectator  status.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">It seems  odd that no better ways have been found to coordinate appropriate activities  among consortia, and to optimize the interaction of the accredited and  non-accredited worlds of standard setting.&nbsp;  Certainly there must be something of potential value that is being left  on the table as a result of this historical, but unnecessary separation.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">If I am  right in believing that there is a need that is going unmet, then the question  becomes how that need should be addressed?&nbsp;  Should some sort of new coordinating and facilitating organization be  formed by and among consortia to better coordinate and leverage their  activities?&nbsp; In the United States and  elsewhere, should a formal interface be created between the national standards  body and consortia, whereby consortia could engage with SDOs to better  coordinate their standard setting activities (e.g., by seeking to reduce  duplication of efforts), and whereby consortia could draw upon some of the  resources already serving SDOs (e.g., conformity testing information, public  advocacy and assistance with ISO/IEC submission mechanics and adoption strategy)?</p>
              <p align="left" class="style2">These  are some of the questions that are being asked within ANSI right now, and I've  been asked to lead a working group that is exploring what some of the  possibilities might be for the accredited and non-accredited standard setting  worlds to work together more productively, to mutual advantage.&nbsp; If you have any thoughts or suggestions, I'd  love to hear them.&nbsp; And if you have an interest  in actively participating in the dialogue as the working group moves forward,  be sure to let me know.</p>

Their efforts are informed by the example of existing organizations, but there is no "how to" manual that sets forth the type of best practices in formation, structure and governance that are likely to lead to success.  In this first of two articles, I review the key areas to be considered, and approaches to be taken, in forming a successful consortium to develop, promote and/or support standards.  These areas and methods relate to defining scope, determining necessary deliverables, identifying and segmenting target membership groups, creating member value propositions, developing budgets and determining appropriate dues structures, designing a staffing model, and adopting key policies.  In the next installment of this series, I will discuss legal issues relating to the creation and support of such organizations.</em></td>

              <p class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Introduction: </em></strong>More than two millennia ago, Archimedes contended that, given a place to stand and a lever long enough, he could move the world.  While theoretically feasible, Archimedes' boast was impossible to achieve in real life.  Had he used the word "standard," however, his contention would have had both practical as well as theoretical validity.</p>
              <p class="style2">For  proof of that statement, one need look no farther than the World Wide Web and  the many activities that can be accomplished through its use, all of which have  been made possible by consortia such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),  the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Organization for the  Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).&nbsp; The total annual budgets of these  organizations combined is less than the operating budget of a town of modest size, and  yet  their work is transforming the world.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">Given  the enormous leverage that these inexpensive efforts have exerted, it is worth  asking: <em>How did they do it?</em>&nbsp; And  also this:&nbsp; To what extent did elements  such as their structure, member composition, specific activities  and policies make such successful results more likely?</p>
              <p class="style2">If  we can answer these questions with precision,  we can do a better job of  forming the  standard setting and standard-supporting organizations  that we hope may achieve similarly important goals in the future.&nbsp; Avoiding the failure of a new consortium is  also important,  because there can be huge direct costs of  failure:&nbsp; thousands of corporations  commit hundreds of millions of dollars to supporting standards-related  organizations, both in dues as well as in human-resource and travel costs, and  make strategic bets based on anticipated standards-related outcomes that can run  into the billions of dollars.&nbsp; And  finally, the fortunes of nations  in international trade are  increasingly affected by the success or failure of the standard setting efforts  launched or supported by domestic corporations.&nbsp; Taken all together, there is  much to be gained by determining  best practices in forming and operating both standard setting organizations, as  well as the other non-profit promotional, certification, advocacy, and other  entities that support standards (collectively, &quot;consortia&quot;).</p>
              <p class="style2">Today there are many hundreds of accredited and  unaccredited standard setting organizations (SSOs) and supporting consortia of  other types serving the technology sector, and more of these organizations are  being formed all the time. <a href="#1">1</a> Some flourish, while others  enjoy only middling success, and some fail to gain traction at all.&nbsp; The reasons for success or failure can vary,  but as with any other type of organization, there are practices that associate  highly with success, and others that are frequently to be observed in  connection with the opposite result.&nbsp;  Surprisingly, in light of the importance and prevalence of such  organizations, the literature on such practices is almost non-existent.</p>
              <p class="style2">Happily, there are so many  SSOs in existence today that the technical process of standard setting is well  understood by large numbers of participants.&nbsp;  But while certainly the proper design and operation of a technical  process is at the core of the success or failure of an SSO, that process must  first be peopled with participants that are skilled and representative of the  target marketplace for the standards to be developed.&nbsp; And if the standards, once drafted, are to become widely adopted,  the membership should also include (at least) a critical mass of early adopters.&nbsp; And finally, the process must be sufficiently  market-aware that the standards, once released, are sufficiently useful and  timely that non-members will adopt them as well.&nbsp; To accomplish this result, the participation of end-users and  others in the distribution chain besides vendors can be invaluable.</p>
              <p class="style2">Achieving this type of  comprehensive membership is far from the automatic result of announcing the launch of a new  standard setting effort.&nbsp; In fact, a  wide variety of critical decisions must be made, and then implemented, in order  to persuade target members that are already likely to be overburdened with  participation in up to hundreds of existing SSOs that they should join yet  another initiative.&nbsp; Once formed, a  consortium must have the right business plan in order to succeed, lest it  become the latest of the many SSOs that have had to confront the question,  &quot;What if you gave a standard and nobody came?&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">Curiously, most standard  setting organizations created today are formed in a more or less ad hoc fashion  by persons that have typically never been associated with such an endeavor in  the past, although they may have been active participants in already  established SSOs in a marketing or technical capacity.&nbsp; As a result, absent the advice of more  experienced advisors, the the founders of a new consortium frequently simply copy another organization with which they are familiar, rather than design an organization that is crafted to address the unique exigencies of  the challenge at hand.</p>
              <p class="style2">Achieving the wide adoption  of standards and accomplishing standards-related goals increasingly requires  addressing additional collaborative activities beyond the process of creating  the standards themselves.&nbsp; Some of these  activities can be performed by the SSO, while others may at times be best  performed by independent or affiliated organizations formed for the task.&nbsp; Such organizations may promote the standards  set by either accredited standards development organizations (SDOs) or  non-accredited consortia, or may create profiles of standards to meet &quot;use  cases&quot; that are broader than the scope of any single SSO, or may engage in  public advocacy in support of standards or standards-related business  objectives.</p>
              <p class="style2">This article will outline  the key factors to be taken into account and the best practices to follow in  designing a successful consortium to pursue any one (or more) of these  objectives, based upon my anecdotal experience in helping create more than 50  consortia over the past 18 years, as well as my experience in advising many  established SSOs in how to restructure themselves mid-career in order to  address evolving market situations and member needs.&nbsp; A full list can be found at this <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/practice_areas/consortium.php#CLIENTLIST">Web page</a> <a href="#2a">2</a> </p>
              <p class="style2">Next month, I will describe  in Part II of this article the legal, tax and more detailed structural issues  that must be addressed in order to create the type of new consortium that is  most likely to achieve the goals of its founders.</p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>I  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mission, Scope and Deliverables</strong></p>
              <p class="style2"><br>
                <span class="style10"><strong><em>Mission:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> The first  question that anyone disposed to create a new SSO should ask is this:&nbsp; &quot;Is this consortium really  necessary?&quot;&nbsp; After all, with so  many existing consortia and SDOs available, it may be that an existing SSO  might be both appropriate as well as willing to undertake the work to be  accomplished.&nbsp;But despite this profusion of alternatives,  it will often be necessary to create a new organization nevertheless.</p>
              <p class="style2">The  most frequent reasons to launch a new SSO are the following, ranked , from  best (e.g., all will benefit from the  existence of a new organization) to worst (e.g., the motives for forming the  new SSO are purely proprietary on the part of the founders):</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>New technology:</em></strong>&nbsp; The area needing standardization does not fall within the  competency of any existing SSO.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Interest:</em></strong>&nbsp;  SSOs have limited staff and budgets, and cannot commission an infinite  number of new working groups.&nbsp; As a  result, a nominally qualified SSO (or SSOs) may not be willing to commit the  necessary resources to the project at hand.</li>
                <li class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>Narrow focus:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> An otherwise logical SSO only addresses standard setting, and the  commercial goals at hand require collaboration in other areas as well (e.g.,  promotion or certification and branding).</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Poor reputation:&nbsp; </em></strong>An otherwise logical SSO to choose has a poorly run or slow  technical process.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Blocking:</em></strong>&nbsp;  Some SSOs are disproportionately controlled by groups of companies, or  in a given case a subset of members may be able to block the formation of a new  working group that could benefit their competitors, or which could erode their  favorable market position through the introduction of a new standard.</li>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Competition:</em></strong>&nbsp; Competing  factions often found multiple SSOs to support opposing standards, each more or less  targeted at the same commercial need.&nbsp;  This typically occurs in an area of new technology, and can be  productive as well as destructive, depending on the situation. <a href="#2">3</a></li>
                <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>Challenge:</em></strong>&nbsp;  SSOs are frequently formed to challenge an incumbent.&nbsp; When the incumbent is a perfectly useful,  adopted standard, the challenge can be anticompetitive (as when a dominant  industry player and its allies seek to gain disproportionate influence over the  marketplace), or procompetitive, as when the reverse is the goal: to displace a  dominant incumbent that is serving the marketplace poorly, either through  stagnation in technology, high prices or overly restrictive or abusive  licensing terms.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>Scope:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> Assuming that  the need for a new organization is real, the next question is one of  scope.&nbsp; SSOs can be short lived or long,  and broadly chartered or narrowly focused.&nbsp;  The following are typical, but not exclusive market situations and  needs that a new consortium may be formed to address:</p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Single standard situations:</span></em></strong><span class="style10">&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">There is often a need for a  single standard to enable a new market or address an isolated need.&nbsp; SSOs that overlap with existing SSOs are  frequently formed for such a purpose, where a limited number of vendors  perceive a need that is both discrete as well as urgent, and where they  believe that a more successful result can be achieved more quickly through a  tightly focused effort.&nbsp; If this is the  only motivation, then the SSO will often dissolve at the end of the effort, if  it is able to find a well-established SSO to take over the completed specification  for long-term maintenance.</span></p>
              <p class="style2"> Single  standard SSOs typically remain in operation for longer periods of time when  part of the original motivation is to limit participation to a small set of  companies, rather than to create a legitimately open standard.&nbsp; At times, such an SSO will create additional  specifications.&nbsp; </p>
              <span class="style2">Where the role of the SSO is to be transitory, a  more lightweight organization and infrastructure is obviously preferable.&nbsp; Often most or all of the active, as well as  the financial, support for such an organization will be provided by the members  and/or contracted for from a third party service provider. </span>
              <p class="style2"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Ecosystem SSOs:</span></em></strong>&nbsp; While some  SSOs evolve from narrowly focused organizations to become much broader in focus, <a href="#3">4</a> others are formed to  address much broader  missions from the  outset.&nbsp; Examples of such   organizations include the <a href="http://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group</a> (OMG) and the <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/">Web Services Interoperability Organization</a> (WS-I), each of which was formed to pursue an ambitious goal requiring broad  industry buy-in.&nbsp; In the case of OMG, it  was to enable and promote a new type of &quot;object oriented&quot; programming  that was intended to lower long-term costs of programming through the development and reuse of  software &quot;objects.&quot;&nbsp; In the  case of WS-I, the goal was to enable and promote Web Services as a useful  computing model.&nbsp; Accomplishing such ambitious  goals in each case required the commitment by major market players and large  operating budgets, in contrast to SSOs launched with more modest objectives. <a href="#4">5</a> </p>
              <p><strong class="style10"><em>Deliverables:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">As noted,  not all organizations that support standards actually create them.&nbsp; A better perspective to take when creating a  new consortium is therefore not to focus on standards as such, but on the  business objective that suggests the need for a standard.&nbsp; Sometimes simply creating a standard is  sufficient, as when the perceived need for that standard is universal and the  path to be taken is  non-controversial. &nbsp;In such a case, the consortium formed need only address standard  setting activities.</span></p>
              <p class="style2">                At  other times, however, the challenge of creating a standard is secondary to the  difficulty of making it become widely adopted, and a consortium that was formed  to set a standard and no more would be inadequate to the need.&nbsp; In this case, a high degree of marketing  collaboration among members may be needed to condition the market, or to  achieve confidence in the new standard.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                New  SSOs will typically accomplish marketing objectives through the same entity  that was formed to create standards.&nbsp; In  other cases, however, a new organization may be needed to support adoption of a  standard created by another organization (typically an SDO) that has no  interest in organizing or supporting marketing activities.</p>
              <span class="style2">A third example of deliverables relates to  branding, and comprises certification test suites, distinctive trademarks, and  testing programs.&nbsp; Again, these  requirements may be developed through the new organization, or, as with various  wireless standards created and under development by the Institute of Electrical  and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), through new consortia formed expressly for  that task. <a href="#5">6</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">In  summary of this point, in order to launch a successful standards-based organization,  a comprehensive effort should be made to identify all links in the chain of  activities that will be needed to achieve the ultimate goal of broad  adoption.&nbsp; A means of supplying each  link must then be devised, either through individual member efforts  coordinated through the new consortium, or by funding and staffing the  consortium to address that discrete need.&nbsp;  Failing to identify and address any of these links may lead to the  partial or complete failure of the standards-based effort.</p>
              <p class="style2">Looked at from another  perspective, the total ultimate cost of a collaborative standards effort cannot  be estimated until all needs are identified and budgeted.&nbsp; As a generality, it is easier to launch a  new consortium with a full, convincing, well-documented business plan than to  form one that is focused purely on standard setting, and then realize soon  after that dues must be increased dramatically in order to achieve a successful  result.</p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members and Value Propositions</strong><br>
              </p>
              <p class="style2">Consortia are  purposefully lightweight operations, with the very largest examples  approximating the budget and staff of a modest business. <a href="#6">7</a> The  great majority of consortia have annual budgets of less than $1,000,000, and  only a few (if any) dedicated staff.&nbsp; In  consequence, they are crucially dependent upon leveraging the efforts of their  members, since no meaningful amount of direct marketing of their standards is  feasible.&nbsp; While it would be misleading  to state that a consortium that has attracted a membership comprising what an  antitrust lawyer would call &quot;market power&quot; will automatically  succeed, it's likelihood of success is certainly dramatically enhanced by  virtue of attracting such a membership.&nbsp;  In contrast, a consortium that fails to attract a significant proportion  of the major vendors in its target area as actively participating members will  have to try harder and execute more skillfully in order to achieve its  objectives.</p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>Determining target member types:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> Attracting the right types as well as adequate numbers of members  is therefore a vital objective for any consortium, but identifying what the  &quot;right&quot; overall membership may be in a given case must still be determined.&nbsp; Most succinctly, the  &quot;right membership&quot; comprises a significant portion of <em>each class  of stakeholder</em> whose active support is needed to achieve broad  adoption.&nbsp; Identifying who these  stakeholders may be is based upon understanding the sales cycle and  sales-gating factors for a given standards-compliant product or service.&nbsp; If it is sold only in connection with other  goods, will those goods need to be compliant as well?&nbsp; Will there be expensive switching costs for end-users associated  with buying the standards-compliant products?&nbsp;  If so, will analysts and integrators be urging end-users to incur these  costs?&nbsp; Will active participation by end  users themselves be needed in order to raise enthusiasm for such compliant  products?</p>
              <p class="style2">                Depending  on the domain of standardization, the classes of core stakeholders may  vary.&nbsp; They include the following,  ranked in the order in which they are generally most important to an SSO:</p>
              <p><span class="style10"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendors:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span>  <span class="style2">Vendors occupy the top position, because they are the proximate  consumers of standards (end-users being the ultimate consumers).&nbsp; To state the obvious, it is vendors that either  do, or do not, decide to adopt a given standard, and therefore the food chain must  begin here, or not at all.&nbsp; As  importantly, a vendor that does not adopt a standard under development by one  SSO may instead back the competing standard being developed by another.&nbsp; Hands down, the best way to get a vendor to  adopt a standard is to secure its participation in developing that standard at  the outset.&nbsp; And the best way to get  more vendors to become members is to announce the names of those vendors that have  already joined, as momentum in membership growth is the strongest indicator of  ultimate adoption, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp; In particular, having a convincing number of vendors among  the founding group can often make the difference between a new consortium being  taken seriously or being ignored, and ultimately to its success or failure.&nbsp; Because of this reality,  successful pre-public announcement recruiting is essential.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Market partners:</span></em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">The success or failure of the  standards-compliant products of some types of vendors (&quot;primary  adopters&quot;) is often dependent upon whether certain downstream, or related,  vendors adopt the same standards (&quot;secondary adopters&quot;).&nbsp; Not uncommonly, the commercial motivations  of the primary adopters may be significantly greater than those of secondary  adopters, who may be indifferent, or even negatively disposed, to implement the  same standards.&nbsp; This is particularly  true where secondary adopters are best served by a single standard rather than  by multiple standards, even if that single standard is a de facto standard (e.g.,  Windows) rather than an open standard (Linux), because it is cheaper to operate  with one standard instead of two (e.g., if an independent software vendor (ISV)  is forced to port new versions of its own software to multiple operating  systems, and to port its software to each new release of the same operating  systems, it will see its development costs multiply rapidly).&nbsp; Examples abound, adding costs to everything  from cameras, to printers to audio and digital formats.</span></p>
              <p class="style2"> Unfortunately,  the support of secondary adopters is often crucial to the success of a  standard, even where adoption is not attractive to such vendors (to continue  the example, what good is an operating system without applications to run on  it?)&nbsp; As a result, recruiting secondary  adopters can be challenging as well  as essential.</p>
              <p class="style2"><span class="style10"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> Governments  (federal, state and local) are huge consumers of technology and other  standardized products.&nbsp; Where government  employees participate in the creation of a standard, they are more likely to  specify the purchase of products that are compliant with that standard.&nbsp; Under the National Technology  Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, <a href="#7">7</a> the United States federal agencies are required  not only to use public standards, rather than &quot;government unique&quot;  standards, but to participate in their development as well.&nbsp; While budgetary constraints have limited such  participation to a degree, it is nonetheless significant.<a href="#8">8</a></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">End users:</span></em></strong><span class="style10">&nbsp;</span><span class="style2"> End users  that participate in standards development, whether in a voting or non-voting  capacity, are more likely to buy products that comply with the standards  developed by the SSOs in which they participate.&nbsp; Attracting end users as members, while usually challenging, is  often also rewarding.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Universities:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Academic members do not represent a very  large market segment for most standardized products, but they do represent  thought leadership in some cases, as well as skilled technical participants,  and (at times) can provide government or grant funding for supporting activities.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Integrators:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Similarly, integrators are more likely to  recommend and work with technology with which they are familiar.&nbsp; </span></p>
              <p><strong class="style10"><em>Value propositions:</em></strong>&nbsp;  <span class="style2">The single most important skill in designing a successful consortium is  to create a value proposition that accomplishes two crucial objectives:&nbsp; attracting a critical mass of  representatives from every important stakeholder class, and (stated baldly)  extracting the maximum revenue from each individual member of each such class  to the extent necessary to pay the bills of the new consortium.&nbsp; The first objective makes ultimate success  more likely, while the second funds the operations needed to make such success  possible.</span></p>
              <p class="style2">                Achieving  these dual objectives involves an analysis and application of the following  criteria in light of the specific circumstances at hand:</p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Value identification:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Consortia can provide value of various  types, not all of which are attractive, or attractive to the same degree, to  each class of stakeholders.&nbsp; From a  programmatic perspective, the following principal categories stand out:</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>The shape of standards:&nbsp; </em></strong><span class="style2">Why &quot;the shape of standards&quot; instead of  simply &quot;standards?&quot;&nbsp; Because  one of the principle benefits of being a participant is to have a say on which  standards are developed, with which features, and in what order.&nbsp; Without this element (as well as related  advantages, such as early access and familiarity with new standards), there is  no reason to be a paying participant, as compared to a free-rider that simply  accepts and uses the standards that are created by others.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Other Deliverables:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Not only standards, but other deliverables  may be important to specific types of members.&nbsp;  Integrators and analysts as well as vendors may find white papers to be  useful, and vendors will often find common marketing collateral to be  useful.&nbsp; In some cases, public advocacy  materials may be produced and shared, and in others consortium-staffed and  organized trade show programming can provide important marketing visibility.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Certification and  branding:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Market awareness and confidence can be  significantly augmented through coordinated certification and branding  campaigns.&nbsp; While most of the expenses of such activities will be  borne by individual members, it is the SSO that owns the test suite and   the brands that members then utilize to identify and promote their products.&nbsp; Including such a program in the mission of a  consortium can provide an essential service of high value to vendor members. <a href="#9">10</a> </span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Activities:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="style2"> In addition  to participation in standards creation, end users may value opportunities to  train their employees.&nbsp; Individual  representatives may look forward to networking opportunities at meetings, and  augment resumes with chair positions.&nbsp;  Public advocacy messaging can be harmonized, and expenses can be shared  to promote matters of common concern.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Since  resources will be limited, the business plan for a new consortium should  include a determination of which types of activities and deliverables will be  most important to achieving success, as well as most appealing to potential  members.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some activities, such as  certification and branding, can be included in the plan for purposes of  recruitment, but will obviously not need to be staffed or funded until the  standards themselves have been developed.</p>
              <p class="style2"> There  are other types of value relating to governance and participation that should  be noted, because they can be apportioned among different classes of members in  order to provide the best match of value to cost (and, as a result, the highest  yield in overall membership dues).&nbsp; The  process of determining these points is not unlike any other exercise in  &quot;yield management,&quot; a concept that recognizes that the same product  or service can have different values to different types of customers.</p>
              <span class="style2">Since consortia cannot usually go as far as  airlines do with their yield management techniques (selling equivalent seats on  the same flight at different prices to different classes of purchasers at  different times), they must therefore &quot;unbundle&quot; the total number of  rights and services that they may offer, and then &quot;rebundle&quot; subsets  of those rights and privileges to match the objectives of different classes of  potential members.&nbsp; The result of this  exercise is to provide multiple value propositions (represented by these  bundles of rights) at ascending prices, such that there is a bundle that is right  for each class. <a href="#10">10</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">The  types of rights that bundle well can be identified and grouped into several  categories:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Strategic direction:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Rights under this category include  determining the scope of operations and  which standards or other  efforts are to be launched, and granting final  approval to the standards developed.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Operational control:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">This includes hiring and firing management,  setting dues, approving liaison relationships, and supervising programming.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Technical influence:</em></strong>&nbsp; </span><span class="style2">Once the overall strategic direction has  been determined, there are still many rights that remain to be apportioned that  provide a measure of influence over the outcome of consortium projects,  including the right to propose new working groups, to offer technology for  adoption in working groups, the right to provide a chair for a working group or  committee, and the right to vote on adoption of standards and other  deliverables.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Technical experience:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Many consortium members do not have a stake  in specific outcomes, but do have a need to become experienced in utilizing the  standards or other deliverables that a consortium may develop.&nbsp; In this case, early access and training  provide significant value, and merely being able to participate in technical  and marketing processes in a non-voting capacity provides an adequate incentive  to participate.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Information:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">At the bottom of the value stack is simple information, which may  include early access to that information.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <span class="style2">Aggregating all of this data, it is possible to  create a matrix of member classes and member rights that are likely to appeal  to the largest number of potential members.&nbsp;  Such a matrix should be unique to the needs of each new organization,  but frequently looks something like the matrix set forth below (excluding minor rights in order to  more clearly demonstrate significant value points).&nbsp; Prices noted would be typical for an information technology  consortium whose mission is deemed to be important to the industry. <a href="#11">12</a>              </span>

              <p class="style10"><strong>III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Income Projections and Budgets</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Setting  a budget and projecting income present something of a chicken and egg dilemma  for new consortia: what will it cost to provide the programs, services and  deliverables needed to attract the members that are willing to pay enough to  fund those same line items?</p>
              <p><strong class="style10"><em>Income projections:</em></strong>&nbsp;  <span class="style2">Assuming that the mission for a new organization is sound, projecting  its potential income  requires estimating three principal  variables: the size of the potential target population of members <em>by class</em> (on which more later); the percentage of representatives of each class that is  likely to join over the first several years; and the appropriate and feasible  price point for each membership class.&nbsp;  Each is worth examining in some detail.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Target population:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Not surprisingly, different consortia will  have target markets of potential members that will vary in size.&nbsp; For example, the number of operating system  vendors is far smaller than the number of business software developers.&nbsp; Consortia that can appeal to multiple types  of potential members (e.g., vendors, integrators, end users, government and so  on) are also more likely to be able to attract sufficient active and economic  participation to achieve their goals.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Percentage participation:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Different domains have different levels of  typical participation.&nbsp; It is easy to  review the Websites of other organizations that are active in the same domain  to determine what level of participation to expect from those that are doing  business or are otherwise active in the sector(s) in question.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong class="style10"><em>Price points:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">From a dues point of view, the census of  potential members will also vary. Some domains will include many large  vendors that are used to paying significant amounts for high level memberships,  while others will be populated only by small vendors that would not be willing to  pay more than a few thousand dollars each, even to gain a board seat in the  new organization.&nbsp; Different classes of  members also have different dues expectations.&nbsp;  For example, government and academic members are typically willing (and able) to  pay far  less  to participate in an  SSO than commercial members.&nbsp; Finally, different missions have different  levels of strategic importance to potential members, with the result that some  large vendors would be wiling to pay as much as a $1million a year to achieve  objectives that are vital to their own strategic plans.</span></p>
              <p class="style2">                Some  of these variations are commonly addressed by charging different amounts for  the same rights, much as the airline does with the price of an otherwise  fungible airline seat.&nbsp; Most typically,  this is addressed by charging less by class of member, and also by charging  less within a single class of member, based upon revenues.&nbsp; The reason why such practices are deemed to  be acceptable by those that pay more is because it is recognized that broad  participation by certain types of members that  cannot afford expensive memberships or that may not be highly motivated to  participate, may be instrumental to success.&nbsp;  As a result, the larger commercial entities (who often also have the  greatest stake in a favorable outcome),  often  subsidize the  participation of these other types of members.</p>
              <p class="style2">                The  following are examples of such differential pricing:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Revenue based differentiation:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">Where large vendors need the participation  of small vendors, dues may be apportioned by ability to pay, with the exact  price breaks depending on the target census of the industry in question.&nbsp; The following differentiation would be typical for the top  level of participation of a consortium (Strategic membership, in the matrix  used above) that wishes to attract the smallest to the largest companies in a  market sector with target companies of all sizes:</span></li>

              <p class="style2">  Since  new consortia are rarely announced unless and until a credible group of founding members  has been assembled on a confidential basis, all of the assumptions made in the  course of framing out a membership structure can be tested during the initial  recruitment process.&nbsp; Usually the   decisions made at this stage, if carefully considered, prove to  be durable in practice.</p>
              <p><span class="style10"><strong><em>Budgets:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">A surprising  number of consortia operate on very small budgets, with the majority operating  on income of less than $500,000 a year, and the great majority on less than  $1,000,000.&nbsp; In fact, the process of  standard setting is not expensive, and has become less so since conference calls and  Web based platforms have become available.&nbsp; Principal costs include the following:</span></p>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">Staff:</span></em></strong><span class="style10">&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">There are four principal models for staffing a consortium, in increasing  order of cost:</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>All volunteer:</em></strong>&nbsp; </span><span class="style2">In this model, virtually all required services are provided by  members on a volunteer basis, with some members providing administrative  services, others hosting meetings, and one member or another taking terms hosting  conference calls and the like.&nbsp; Only  limited services are purchased in the market place, such as accounting, design  and printing of marketing collateral, and legal services.&nbsp; For consortia that set or maintain only one  standard that is not in competition with another standard or with a dominant de  facto standard, this model can be quite adequate, and there are many such  organizations with total annual budgets in the $25,000 to $50,000  range.&nbsp; Where the program is more ambitious or  urgent, however, this model usually falls short.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Secretariat:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">A few consortia have adopted a model borrowed from the world of  accredited standard setting.&nbsp; In this  model, one member (as compared to one national standard setting organization,  in the accredited model) volunteers to function as the &quot;Secretariat,&quot;  providing most or all administrative and other services, either without charge,  or for payments derived from the fees of other members.&nbsp; In some organizations, the Secretariat role  rotates among members.&nbsp; Dues costs of  organizations operating under this model can be relatively low, if the  Secretariat is not reimbursed.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Outsourced:</em></strong>&nbsp; </span><span class="style2">Many  consortia outsource all of their needs to a management company.&nbsp; Depending on the service provider, nearly  all services are provided by a single vendor, including marketing,  administration, bookkeeping, call and meeting hosting and much more.&nbsp; Such full service providers frequently  provide a mix of full-time, dedicated staff to serve large individual clients,  supplemented by the shared services of other employees where full-time services  are not required. <a href="#12">13</a> Other management companies provide only core services, and then  sub-contract for those services that they do not provide themselves.&nbsp; The range of costs for this model can range  from very low (e.g., $25,000 a year) to very large, since virtually all costs  may flow through the management company.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Dedicated:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span>  <span class="style2">The largest consortia often choose to lease their own offices (sometimes  on multiple continents) and hire their own dedicated staff, purchasing only the  same types of services externally (e.g., legal and audit) that any other  staffed business of comparable size would normally purchase in the market.&nbsp; Except where dedicated staff are seconded by  a member (often in lieu of dues), the base line budget for a consortium with  dedicated staff is likely to begin at $250,000, since it is unlikely that a  full-time staff person would be hired unless significant additional costs would  be incurred as well, and the first hire is usually an Executive Director rather  than a low level administrative person.&nbsp;  Organizations with multiple, full time employees typically have budgets  that range from $500,000 on up.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">In  fact, most consortia incorporate two or more of these approaches.&nbsp; As with other businesses, fully burdened  staff costs for non-volunteer or seconded staff include taxes and benefits.</p>
              <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10"></span></em></strong><strong><em><span class="style10">Communications:</span></em></strong><span class="style10">&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">Communications include a variety of  expenses, some or all of which can be provided by members or by others for a  fee:
              </span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              <ul>
                <li><span class="style10"><em>Website development  and hosting:</em>&nbsp; </span><span class="style2">The core platform for most technology  consortia today is the organization's Website, and accordingly the proper design,  hosting and maintenance of that resource should be a priority.&nbsp; For a small consortium maintaining a single  standard, the site can be modest, but for an active consortium with multiple  activities that wishes to have an archive, on line voting, multiple simultaneous password  protected sections, and more, the complexity and cost of the Website can  become a significant expense. <a href="#13">14</a> </span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Conference call and Webex hosting:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">Some consortia have many working group calls per  week.&nbsp; If not hosted by members, this  can become a significant expense.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Member communications:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">Most active consortia have electronic  newsletters and other ways to maintain touch with their members.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><em><strong>T</strong></em><strong><em>radeshows:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">Larger  consortia sometimes have their own tradeshow booths, with all of the resulting design,  shipping and storage costs.&nbsp; Others will  simply encourage their members to display a consortium logo in their own  booths, and keep a stack of consortium marketing collateral on their countertops. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing and Public relations:</span></em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">While consortia do not have the budgets to  do significant marketing, they do typically undertake at least the following  activities:</span></p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong class="style10"><em>Press releases:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">A typical consortium will issue from a few to dozens of press  releases a year.&nbsp; Consortia often also  post member news relating to their standards compliant products  and services at the consortium site as well.</span></li>
                  <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Marketing collateral:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="style2"> For use by members and the consortium at  trade shows and in other situations.</span></li>
                  <li class="style2"><strong class="style10"><em>White papers:</em></strong>&nbsp; Sometimes issued in connection with trade shows or special issues of  trade journals.</li>
                  <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Marketing studies:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">These are more cheaply purchased jointly  than individually, although it is not always easy to negotiate shared use with  the research firm.</span></li>
                  <li><strong class="style10"><em>Speaking engagements:</em></strong> <span class="style2">One role  of dedicated staff is to speak regularly at trade shows.&nbsp; Consortia  also often volunteer to propose  topics and put together panels at trade shows in order to highlight their areas of  activity.</span></li>
                  <li><strong class="style10"><em>Article placements and interviews:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">For all the usual reasons.</span></li>
                </ul>
              <span class="style2">A  good management company will often provide or contract out for many of these  services, often at a lower cost than a PR firm would charge.

              <p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other:</span></em></strong>&nbsp;  <span class="style2">Other principal line items include the following:</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Hardware, software and Internet access:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">IT costs in equipment and maintenance  obviously scale with staff.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Accounting and legal:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Most consortia of a certain size will  commission an annual audit (and if they are registered with the IRS as a public  charity rather than a trade association, will be required to do so).&nbsp; Legal services can range from modest to  significant, depending on such factors as antitrust risk, number of staff,  frequency of entering into significant contracts, need to create and revise  intellectual property rights policies, and other activities of legal  sensitivity.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Insurance:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span class="style2"> Most consortia should plan on obtaining Directors and Officers  insurance, as it is quite inexpensive for non-profits (e.g., $3,000 - $5,000  for $1 to $2 million in coverage), but the policy needs to be reviewed and  negotiated carefully so that the risks of greatest concern are not excluded by  the insurer.&nbsp; Consortia with staff  should also plan on obtaining normal business coverages as well.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Travel:</em></strong>&nbsp;  <span class="style2">Member travel is invariably at the cost of the member, but staff travel can become a  significant budget item.&nbsp; Staff travel principally  relates to speaking support at in-person  member meetings, and member recruitment and retention.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="style2">Despite  this lengthy series of line items, most consortia are able to accomplish their missions within the resources available.&nbsp; That being said, those that can afford  dedicated staff (whether direct hired, or retained through a management  company) are more likely to achieve their missions in competitive, fast moving  settings.</p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policies and Procedures</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">SSOs  succeed or fail with the credibility of their standards.&nbsp; As a result, the policies that an SSO adopts  can have a major influence on whether its standards are adopted readily or not  at all.</p>
              <p><span class="style10"><strong><em>Openness:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">Except in  the case where the founding members of a new SSO control the majority of the  marketplace, making adoption by all others a given, an SSO can do itself  irreparable harm by being insufficiently open in its policies.&nbsp; Absent such a policy, non-members may be  loath to adopt what they perceive to be standards over which they have no  control, and which may be manipulated to their disadvantage.&nbsp; For current purposes, &quot;openness&quot;  is the product of the following policies <a href="#15a">15</a>:</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Membership criteria:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Membership criteria should be no more  restrictive than necessary to ensure an efficient process.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Costs of participation:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">To the extent possible while still spreading  costs fairly and accomplishing objectives, dues required to participate in all  meaningful activities should be made acceptable to all classes of stakeholders.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Member acceptance:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">All applicants that meet the established  criteria should be automatically admitted in any category to which they choose  to apply.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Governance:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">The Board or other governing body should not be controlled in the  long term by the founders, although founding members will typically hold the  initial seats.&nbsp; The board should also  represent all classes of stakeholders, regardless of whether each class can  afford a top-level membership.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Technical Participation:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">All members of eligible classes should be  entitled to participate equally in technical and other activities.</span></li>
                <li><strong class="style10"><em>Transparency:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">At minimum, all standards should be posted for public comment prior  to adoption. Some consortia make all of the minutes and other proceedings of  their working groups public from the beginning of a technical process.</span></li>
                <li><span class="style10"><strong><em>Adoption:</em></strong>&nbsp;  </span><span class="style2">All standards should be available for implementation by non-members as  well as members on a non-discriminatory basis.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <strong class="style10"><em>Intellectual property rights:</em></strong>&nbsp; <span class="style2">Technology  standards increasingly exist under a cloud of contention involving patent  claims, usually referred to under the generic phrase &quot;intellectual  property rights&quot;, or simply &quot;IPR.&quot;&nbsp; Members have two competing concerns when they join an SSO: that  they will accidentally become bound to license a patent through failure to  disclose it in timely fashion, and that some other member will deliberately  cause a standard to infringe upon their undisclosed patent.&nbsp; The result is that members (especially those  with very large patent portfolios) on the one hand want to make an IPR policy  lax enough to permit them to avoid accidental commitments, while tough enough  to prevent others from embedding IPR in a standard, only to assert their  &quot;submarine patent&quot; against adopters at a later date and demand  extortionate licensing fees.&nbsp; The  unhappy result is that IPR policies today are not as tough as they could be,  although the trend is to make them more demanding. <a href="#14">16</a></span> 
              <p class="style2">Regardless  of the lack of perfection of current IPR policies, it is a fact today that most  large vendors will not join a new consortium until an IPR policy has been  negotiated and adapted to that they find to be acceptable.&nbsp; This truism applies even to a new SSO's  founders, providing the major impediment to speedily forming a new  consortium.&nbsp; Given that different  companies have strongly held opinions on even minor language variations in IPR  policies, the rather perverse mark of a successful effort to draft an IPR  policy for a new SSO today is whether everyone is equally unhappy with the  final result. <a href="#17a">17</a> </p>
              <span class="style10"><strong><em>Technical process:</em></strong>&nbsp;</span> <span class="style2">As the  technical process is at the core of an SSO, the proper design of the supporting  structure for standard setting in a new consortium is crucial.&nbsp; There are, of course, countless examples to  choose from, and they are not all the same.&nbsp;  Some processes, as can be expected, have proven to be more effective and  efficient than others, and some will prove to be better suited to certain types  of standards or situations than others.&nbsp;  Accordingly, designing and documenting the process for a new SSO should  not be a haphazard matter of cloning the documentation and rules of another randomly  selected organization, regardless of whether some of the founders are familiar  with that process. <a href="#15">18</a>              </span>
              <p class="style2">The staffing of a  technical process is equally important, as good results are crucially dependent  upon the neutral, effective leadership of the chairs of each committee and  working group.</p>
              <p class="style10"><strong>V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Consortia  have now enjoyed a successful existence in significant numbers of nearly twenty  years.&nbsp; With approximately 500 in  operation in the information and communications technology industry at any  point in time, there is therefore a wide range of examples and experience upon  which to draw in forming a new organization.&nbsp;  Examining the collective successes and failures of these organizations  can provide clear guidance on how to structure a consortium that is biased  towards achieving its objectives.</p>
              <span class="style2">The information in this article has rarely, if  ever, been collected in one convenient place, but is still summary in  nature.&nbsp; As a result, those charged with  creating a new organization would be well advised to seek the guidance of those  that have created successful organizations in the past, and to review the  Websites of those successful consortia that already exist in their targeted  domain space.&nbsp;If these tools are used, there is every reason to assume that a new  standards-related organization that is otherwise based upon a sound business  case can be designed to be well-poised to meet its  objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

An example of productive competition can be  found in the emergence and competition of multiple standards and SSOs in the  wireless networking space.&nbsp; The most  successful competitors proved to be Bluetooth and WiFi, each of which found  significant commercial followings for the uses to which each was best suited,  although both standards (and at least one other that was supported by its own  SSO, called HomeRF) initially competed head to head for use in the same  applications.&nbsp; For more on this and  other standards wars, both good and bad, <em>see</em> Updegrove, Andrew, <em>Standards  Wars:&nbsp; Situations, Strategies and  Outcomes<em>.</em></em>&nbsp; ConsortiumInfo.org, Consortium Standards Bulletin,  Vol. V, No. 3 (March 2006), <em>at</em> <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar06.php#feature">http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar06.php#feature</a>&gt;.</p>

                  <strong>of Cat and Mouse</strong></p>
              <p align="left" class="style56"><strong>Saturday, November 11, 2006 @ 02:18 PM EDT</strong></p>
              <p class="style2">Once upon a time, there was something new called &quot;the  Internet,&quot;&nbsp;and it was an unknown quantity.&nbsp;&nbsp;While some  guessed what it could become, most did not.&nbsp; Famously, Mark Andreessen -  of Mosaic, and later Netscape fame - and Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the W3C,  did, while Bill Gates did not.&nbsp; At a deeper technical level and less  publicly, those that helped create the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names  and&nbsp;Numbers - or <a href="http://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a> - did, and the standards analogue of Bill Gates - the  International Telecommunications Union - or <a href="http://www.itu.int/home/index.html">ITU</a> - did not.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="style2">                The result was that ICANN came to control a small but vital piece  of the Internet, called the name domain root directories, while the ITU, a  venerable global telecommunications standards organization existing under the  aegis of the United Nations, and tracing its origins to 1865, did not, although  perhaps it could have laid claim to those essential elements had it appreciated  their future importance at the time.</p>
              <p class="style2">                And that road not taken, as Robert Frost once said, has made all  the difference.</p>
              <p class="style2">                The  way in which the future control of the root directories of the Internet was  decided has become almost the stuff of legends (some accounts claim that the  assignment to ICANN was almost haphazard, while other versions, such as <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_8-1/internet_governance.html">this  one</a>, see more deliberation in the process).&nbsp;&nbsp; By some lights,  the ITU would have been the logical home for the directories to reside, but  regardless of your favorite interpretation of the actual events, the ITU did  not seem terribly interested in the root directories at the time.&nbsp; In any case, the ITU lost out.<br>
                              <br>
                In recent years, the ITU has seemed determined to reclaim what it may regard to  be its wayward child, and allegations of such an intent were particularly rife  in the run up last November to the second global meeting of the World Summit on  the Information Society (WSIS).&nbsp; Then, it seemed, the ITU was making a  play to scoop the directories from ICANN's grasp, under cover of championing  the cause of internationalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="style2">                That  cause was being championed by&nbsp;a number of countries that  resented&nbsp;the&nbsp;rights retained by the United States Department of  Commerce to influence the management of the root directories.&nbsp; Those  rights derived  from the fact that the Internet itself had&nbsp;been  created under the auspices of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  (DARPA).&nbsp; But the ITU's challenge passed, and its effort was in any event  obscured by the firestorm of protest over the insistence of the Bush  administration that the US maintain its&nbsp;attenuated - but symbolically  important - control over ICANN.&nbsp;&nbsp; (You  can read much more about the issues and events in <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov05.php">this issue</a> of the  CSB.)</p>
              <p class="style2">                Now, it seems, the ITU is testing the waters again, as suggested  by a <a href="http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2006/20.html">press release</a> issued by the ITU on  the occasion of the 17th ITU Plenipotentiary Conference, an event that is  &quot;expected to attract some 2,000 participants, including 80 ministers, from  over 150 countries representing both government and the private sector as well  as regional and international organizations.&quot;</p>
              <p class="style2">                See if you agree, based upon the following outtake from that press  release.&nbsp; I've emphasized the lines that support this interpretation most  obviously:</p>

                <p class="style2">&nbsp;The Tunis  phase of the World Summit on the Information Society recognized that the  internet has evolved into a global public facility, and that its governance  should constitute a core issue of the Information Society agenda. Moreover, it  called for a multilateral, transparent and democratic international management  of the internet, with the full involvement of governments, the private sector,  civil society and international organizations.</p>
                <p class="style2">                Proposals on the  table underline the fact that the internet has spawned new challenges that  could <strong><em>threaten the security and stability</em></strong> of telecommunication  networks. For this reason, <strong><em>a number of countries</em></strong> call for <strong><em>ITU  to contribute constructively to the work on internet governance and advocate a  stronger ITU role</em></strong> in enhancing network security and stability, in  countering spam and in the smooth management of critical internet resources <em><strong>including  Internet Domain Names and addresses.</strong></em> <strong><em>Proposals have also been  made for the increased internationalization of the internet</em></strong>, in  particular the ability of developing countries to participate fully in  internet-related technical and policy processes.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style2"><strong><em>Others call  for the creation of a specific group (I2G: ITU Internet Group),</em></strong> win <em>[sic]</em> the Telecommunication  Standardization Sector to coordinate the technical aspects of Telecommunication  Networks that support the internet and to deal with all other technical matters  related to internet governance.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="style2">                Hmmm.&nbsp; One wonders which nations can  be counted in this <strong><em>number of countries</em></strong> that are <strong><em>calling on</em></strong> (specifically) the ITU?&nbsp; And who has made these <strong><em>proposals</em></strong>?&nbsp;  Finally, what are the names and identities of these <strong><em>others</em></strong>?&nbsp;  I find all of this ambiguity to be very intriguing, and look forward to  learning who each of these mysterious parties may be.&nbsp; Certainly energy  continues to be exhibited to wrest the root directories from the grip of ICANN  in the <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=200611111718565">Internet  Governance Forum</a> that was commissioned as a result of WSIS, and which just  held its <a href="http://www.igfgreece2006.gr/">first meeting</a> in  Athens.&nbsp; But I wonder whether there is really a crowd clamoring for the  ITU to lead the charge to reclaim the root directories.</p>
              <p class="style2">                In truth, many feel that ICANN has not  demonstrated  a sterling record of stewardship, independent  of whether the United States has an untoward level of control over the root  directories.&nbsp; And in fact, from an historical perspective, the ITU would  be a logical place for the root directories to be administered.</p>
              <p class="style2">                But that does not automatically equate  to&nbsp;a conclusion that&nbsp;the ITU should be the heir apparent to take  control, assuming that there is a need to transfer the directories to a third  party at all.&nbsp; ICANN, after all, is already custom-made for the purpose of  hosting the root directories, and the more straightforward approach could be to  reform its governance structure.&nbsp; Or  perhaps a new custom-made host would be a better choice, one that would lack  ICANN's baggage, and which would hopefully avoid the ITU's reputation for  bureaucracy.</p>
              <p class="style2">                What I do know is that the role of the  Internet is far too important in the modern world to be a pawn in anyone's  political game, whether it be the US Department of Commerce, ICANN, the United  Nations or the ITU.&nbsp; The root directories are a creature and a requirement  of technology, not politics, and need to be treated with the degree of care and  neutrality that such essential technical services demand.&nbsp; </p>

                <p><span class="style56"><em>#44 </em></span><strong class="style38"><em> A Level Playing Field</em></strong></p>
                <p class="style2">It is often said that a  benefit of standardization is to ensure a &quot;level playing field&quot; among  competitors, and so, for the most part, it is.&nbsp;  True, a contender with a large war chest will always be able to field a  more expensive and forbidding marketing team than a small competitor.&nbsp; But by fixing some of the parameters of the  game, each side is both enabled as well as forced to focus on providing more  excitement, service, or other differentiators in order to attract more paying  fans than its opponents. </p>
                <p class="style2">OK, maybe my introduction was a little  heavy on  sports metaphors.&nbsp; After  all, sports have nothing at all to do with standards, do they?</p>
                <p class="style2">Or do they?&nbsp; In fact, every sport you can think of is  based firmly on its own standards, without which that sport could not exist as  we know it.&nbsp; And many of the same  challenges (how rigid should a standard be?&nbsp;  How to avoid forking in how a game is played?) and mechanisms (standards  bodies) can be found in the world of sports as well.&nbsp; So this month, let's consider just a few examples of the role of <em>standards  in sports</em>.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2"><img src="nov06/cowboys.jpg" width="249" height="243" hspace="4" border="0" align="left" usemap="#Map">How about we start with football.&nbsp; It's played with a fixed number of players,  using rules that are uniform across a league.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every field is identical to every other field, subject to  certain limited, prescribed exceptions.&nbsp;  For example, like a technical standard, every field has the mandatory  element <em>grass surface</em>, but  two alternative implementations of  that single element are permitted: <em>natura</em>l and <em>Astroturf</em>.</p>
                <p class="style2">And, of course, every football playing field  must implement the mandatory specification element identified as <em>level  surface</em>.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style2">Why so much  regimentation?&nbsp; One reason is in order  to provide as close to constant competitive conditions as possible, so that  rankings are meaningful for playoff purposes, and statistics are relevant over  time.&nbsp; Rules also give rise to the  classic &quot;network effect&quot; of standardization, since with set rules, a  distinct sport can become better identified and more widely played, leagues can  form and flourish, a huge crop of youngsters can begin training for the careers  that only the very best will achieve, and greater adoption (by fans) can  occur.&nbsp; Am I straining the example?&nbsp; Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football">Wikipedia entry</a> on football,  and see the many different branches of the game that never achieved the  popularity of European football, American football, or rugby.</p>
                <p class="style2">At the same time, vendors  (franchise owners) compete on value added features (star players and innovative  plays) and make additional profits on non-standardized, but related products  and services (beer, logo-bearing merchandise, programs, and so on).&nbsp; And, of course, there are standards bodies  that set the rules, do compliance testing of fields (as well as players' bodily  fluids.<img src="nov06/sox.jpg" width="249" height="263" hspace="4" vspace="2" border="0" align="left" usemap="#Map2"></p>
                <p class="style2">How about baseball?&nbsp; The same reality obtains here, with a few important  differences:&nbsp; not every stadium is  identical (I live in Boston, home of the Green Monster).&nbsp; As it happens in many other standard setting  circumstances, those who created the stadium standard didn't succeed in setting such a tight  standard.&nbsp; It would appear that certain vested interests were able to allow for  some elements of the physical specification (e.g., the height and distance of  the walls that a line drive must top in order to become a home run), to escape the standard, despite many good reasons why they  should have been fixed.&nbsp; Sound like any technical standard results  you've witnessed? </p>
                <p class="style2">Rigidity of standardization  in competition is not always susceptible to the same  precision of compliance testing that a linesman's chain (or an Underwriters  Lab test) can provide, however.&nbsp; For example,  few fields of competition use specifications that are at once as rigid and as  subjective as&hellip;dog shows.<br>
                  </p>
                <p class="style2">Consider, for example, the  Australian Terrier.&nbsp; The standard  for the Australian Terrier may be found at the Website of the appropriate standards  body, which in this country is, of course, the American Kennel Club.&nbsp; According to the long and detailed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=australian+terrier&page=3">specification</a> for Australian Terriers posted at the AKC Website, &quot;[a]ny deviation  from this description must be penalized to the extent of the  deviation.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad dog!<br>  
                    <img src="nov06/dog.jpg" width="249" height="261" border="0" align="left" usemap="#Map3"></p>
                <span class="style2">
                <p>How rigid (and subjective)  is the standard to which little Meg would be held to if she is entered into  competition?&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are extracts from the  c. 1,000-word AKC standard:</p>
                </span>
                <p class="style2"><em><strong>Skull</strong></em><strong> -</strong> Viewed from  the front or side is long and flat, slightly longer than it is wide and full  between the eyes, with slight but definite stop. <em><strong>Muzzle</strong></em><strong> -</strong> Strong and powerful with slight fill under the eyes. The jaws are powerful. <em><strong>Body</strong></em><strong> -</strong> The body is of sturdy structure with ribs well-sprung but not rounded,  forming a chest reaching slightly below the elbows with a distinct keel. The  loin is strong and fairly short with slight tuck-up. <em><strong>Tail</strong></em><strong> -</strong> Set on high and carried erect at a twelve to one o'clock position, docked in  balance with the overall dog leaving slightly less than one half, a good  hand-hold when mature. <em><strong>Feet</strong></em><strong> -</strong> Small, clean, catlike;  toes arched and compact, nicely padded turning neither inward nor outward. </p>
                <p class="style2">Pity the judge that must  look into those eyes and pronounce little Meg's stop to be too indefinite, fill  too full, or tail out of balance with the overall dog.&nbsp; Could you?</p>
                <p class="style2">If that feels like too much  pressure, let's turn back to active sports.&nbsp;  Sailing, for example.&nbsp; Over a  hundred years ago, yachtsman realized that the state of competition would be  greater on a race by race basis if everyone used a boat with those design  features locked down that are most closely associated with speed.&nbsp; The result was the creation of the many  classes of boats that are competitively raced around the world today.&nbsp; In the case of boats actually used in the  Olympics, not only are the dimensions fixed, but even the materials (and the  builders) are prescribed as well.</p>
                <p class="style2"><img src="nov06/boats.jpg" width="249" height="288" hspace="4" border="0" align="left" usemap="#Map4">Of course, standards that are enforced this  rigidly are as rare in sports as they are in commerce, and stifle design  innovation in the name of pure performance competition (or interoperability).&nbsp; In order to provide for competition in  design as well as crew performance, other yacht class rules use complex  formulae instead, which allow the designer to adjust each variable as she  wishes, so long as the mathematical output equals the magic number specified in the design class rules in order to qualify.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style2">Hence, 12 meter boats, the  algorithm for which is as follows:</p>
                <div align="center" class="style2"><img src="nov06/equation.jpg" width="278" height="49">                </div>
                <p class="style2">where <em>L </em>equals length  of waterline, <em>S</em> equals sail area, <em>F </em>equals freeboard , <em>d</em> equals the difference between girth and chain, <em>freeboard</em> means the  altitude of the deck above the waterline, <em>girth</em> means the measurement around  the boat from one sideboard, under the keel and then back over the top on the  opposite side back to the original side, and <em>chain</em> means,&hellip;oh, never  mind. </p>
                <p class="style2">If that bit of mathematica  gives you (like me) a headache, you might prefer the nine Square Meter classes,  which are rigid in one element only, and open in all others.&nbsp; For these boats, only the total sail area of  the boat is fixed, leaving all other parameters to the whim of the designer, as  in:</p>
                <p align="center" class="style2">15 sqm = total sail area</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                  Feel  more comfortable with that standard?&nbsp;  Me too.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                  These  disparate sailing examples provide a particularly interesting juxtaposition to  technical standards, as the range of approaches taken varies from the most fixed  to the most rigid, with each choice serving a specific, logical and useful  purpose.&nbsp; Among interoperability  standards, one could compare (for example) the square meter standard with the  physical interoperability standards that control light sockets, each of which  involves only a few parameters (e.g., diameter, screw threads, depth), leaving  many other attributes of the bulb to the designer (e.g., frosted vs. clear,  large bulb vs. small, round vs. candle flame shape, constant vs. flickering).</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                  In  short, sports and technical standards have a great deal in common, and why  should it be otherwise?&nbsp; Both commerce  and sports present the very essence of competition, and that competition can  have very high stakes.&nbsp; Increasingly,  business and sports are  merging into one &ndash; sports having become very big  business indeed.</p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                  In  fact, standards, and all of the mechanisms and norms that attend  can be observed fractally in many different situations throughout modern  life.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; </p>
                <p align="left" class="style2">                  They  work.</p>
