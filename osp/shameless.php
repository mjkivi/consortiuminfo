			<h1>Shameless Linking Requests</h1>
			<p><strong>Dept. of "What were they thinking":</strong> On this page, we reproduce, in their entirety and without alteration (well, maybe we added the introductions) some of the more inexplicable linking requests received by ConsortiumInfo.org.</p>

			<p class="OspSectionHeader">Hair-Brushes.Com</p>
			<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <em>The good folks at Hair-Brushes.com have been looking around the web for places to establish logical links to their web site. And can you think of a more relevant site than ConsortiumInfo.org? We don't think so, either. In fact,. a recent study by Forrester Research reveals that the consortium community buys 38% of all hair brushes worldwide. Now that is a huge number, isn't it? The next highest percentage category of hair brush users trailed far behind, with only an 11% market share (as reported by the Hair Replacement Commercial Actors Union (HRCAU), a trade association representing actors that have appeared in hair replacement commercials.)</em></p>

			<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <em>One of the most pervasive standards known to man is the shoe size standard. Whether you are looking for sneakers or, like our friend ravi offers, dance shoes, you can be confident that your size will be the same no matter what brand you decide on. Ravi was so eager to be the exclusive dance shoe distributor to the standards community that he misspelled the name of the site. No problem, buddy. We took care of it for you. And we could watch the animated dance image all day.</em></p>
