			<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>CONSORTIUMINFO.ORG ANNOUNCES SECOND<br />ANNUAL NEWS SOURCES AWARDS</strong></p>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Awards recognize the news sources that best conveyed<br />the role of standards and open source in 2005</em></p>
			<p><strong>Boston, MA (January 5, 2006)</strong> &mdash; ConsortiumInfo.org, the most comprehensive resource on the Internet for news and information on technology and communication standards, announced the winners of its second annual News Sources Awards.  The Awards are made to the news services and journalists that best report on ITC standards and open source software news, and to the standards development organizations that were considered to be most newsworthy in 2005.</p>
			<p>The Awards are made in two categories: statistical and special recognition. The former are based on the number of articles per individual source selected for linking at the ConsortiumInfo.org <a href="/news/">Standards News Portal</a> from the thousands that were reviewed during the course of the year for that purpose, while the latter are based on the perceived value of the news and analysis that individual journalists provided to, and about, the open standards and open source communities.</p>
