			<p><strong><a href="http://www.ansi.org/">American National Standards Institute</a></strong><br />ANSI administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization and conformity assessment system. Its website regularly includes materials and links to other online resources relating to standards development and antitrust law.</p>
			<div class="hr"></div><hr />
			<p><strong><a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/">Cover Pages, an Online Resource for Markup Languages Technologies</a></strong><br />The Cover Pages, a constantly updated Internet based resource, describes its mission as to provide: "A comprehensive Web-accessible reference collection supporting the SGML/XML family of (meta) markup language standards and their application. The principal objective in this public access knowledgebase is to promote and enable the use of open, interoperable standards-based solutions that protect digital information and enhance the integrity of communication. A secondary objective in The Cover Pages is to provide reference material on enabling technologies compatible with descriptive markup language standards and applications: object modeling, semantic nets, ontologies, authority lists, document production systems, and conceptual modeling. NB. This statement and the resource itself are works in progress, subject to continuous revision." The site itself is even broader and more content rich than this summary suggests, with sections on Technology and Society, historical documents, a bibliography, FAQs on the various markup languages, and many other useful resources compiled by Editor Robin Cover. The site is hosted by OASIS Open, and underwritten by corporate sponsors.</p>
