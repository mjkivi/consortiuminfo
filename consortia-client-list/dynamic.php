			<h2>Gesmer Updegrove LLP Services to Consortia and Open Source Foundations</h2>

			<p class="story">Since 1988, <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/firm.php">Gesmer Updegrove LLP</a> has represented 
			over <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/consortia-client-list/#CLIENTLIST"><?php echo $numrows; ?> consortia</a>, open source development
			foundations, and accredited standards development organizations
			(collectively, "consortia"), in most cases from before their formal date of
			formation. We also advise major corporations, universities, government
			agencies, and others in connection with consortium participation
			strategies, and provide standards-related litigation, expert witness, and
			dispute resolution services.</p>

			<p class="story">Quite simply, we believe that we are the most experienced law firm in this
			area of practice. A complete list of our consortium clients 
			<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/consortia-client-list/#CLIENTLIST">appears below</a>. 
			For further information, contact <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bio/index.php">Andrew Updegrove</a> at
			andrew.updegrove@gesmer.com, or by telephone at 617-350-6800 </p>

			<ol start="I" style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
			<li>
				<b>I. Areas of Expertise.</b> Our full service firm provides all of the areas
				of legal and advisory services that consortia and foundations need to
				succeed.
				<ol style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; padding: 0; margin: 20px 0 0 5px;">
					<li>
						1. Consulting: We provide strategic and business, as well as legal
						advice, to help our clients structure and manage organizations that are
						designed to succeed. <br/>
						Examples:
					
						<ul>
							<li>Designing appropriate membership classes and defining
							industry-appropriate membership fees to attract all necessary categories
							of participants</li>

							<li>Developing appropriate budgets, staffing models, and Board and
							management structures</li>

							<li>Designing and deploying certification and branding programs to build
							public awareness and end user confidence in consortium standards</li>

							<li>Facilitating retreats to restructure or retarget existing consortia
							to address new market challenges and opportunities</li>

							<li>Acting as "best practices" resource in all areas of consortium
							formation and operation (see, e.g., the ConsortiumInfo.org Essential
							Guide to Standards)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						2. Intellectual Property Rights ("IPR"): We provide a wide variety of
						services in the IPR area, addressing all of the needs of our consortium
						clients.
						
						<ul>
							<li>IPR Policies: All consortia need clear IPR rules and procedures
							suitable for their activities, as well as ongoing attention to the
							application of these rules in the trenches. We assist in all aspects of
							this process, including:</li>

							<li>Creating practical and effective IPR policies that reflect the norms
							of the industries in which our consortium clients operate, from
							RAND-Fee to RAND-Free</li>

							<li>Drafting technical process documents to ensure effective IPR
							management and smooth operations</li>

							<li>Helping resolve IPR-related disputes among members, and between
							members and third parties, as they arise</li>

							<li>In all of these activities, we help our clients balance member concerns
							relating to their IPR with the common goal of avoiding downstream IPR
							"surprises."</li>

							<li>Trademark: All of our consortium clients require some level of
							trademark assistance, including some or all of the following:</li>

							<li>Designing cost-effective, global trademark, service mark and/or
							certification registration programs</li>

							<li>Registering and managing global portfolios of marks, and defending
							marks against infringers</li>

							<li>Designing and implementing certification and branding programs</li>

							<li>Patent: While it almost never makes sense for consortia to register
							patents, patent issues often arise that require legal review. We help our
							consortium clients by:</li>

							<li>Advising how to deal with infringement allegations involving
							in-process and already adopted standards</li>

							<li>Securing and using patent opinions when needed on a defensive basis</li>

							<li>Acting as expert witnesses in standards-related patent litigation</li>

							<li>Licensing: Active consortia receive technology and make it available
							on a regular basis. We cover all aspects of such technology transfers,
							including:</li>

							<li>Providing user-friendly "clickwrap" licenses for all normal usages of
							consortium work product (e.g., standards, test suites, trademarks and
							certification marks)</li>

							<li>Documenting contributions of technology by members and third parties
							in such a way as to ensure easy of use and absence of potential
							liabilities</li>

							<li>For our open source clients, selecting appropriate licenses for work
							product, and drafting matching contribution and other agreements</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						3. Tax: We provide ongoing tax services, including:
						<ul style="list-style-image: url(/images/icons/icon_li_list.gif);">
							<li>Qualifying our clients as tax-exempt trade associations, charities
							and foundations, as best suits their business goals</li>

							<li>Monitoring and advising our clients on an ongoing basis to protect
							their tax status</li>

							<li>Creating tax-exempt and taxable subsidiaries and affiliates as needed
							to achieve evolving goals</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						4. Antitrust: By their nature, consortia bring competitors together to
						achieve common purposes. While regulators respect the "pro-competitive"
						effects that consortia can have, we provide real-time advice to our clients
						to ensure that they do not inadvertently violate applicable laws.<br/>
						Examples:
						<ul>
							<li>Assisting in the filing of registrations and updates under the
							National Cooperative Research and Production Act</li>

							<li>Attending Board meetings, either in-person or by telephone, or (where
							budgets are more limited) reviewing board minutes before they are
							distributed</li>

							<li>Providing appropriate Board and Member antitrust policies and
							advisory memoranda</li>

							<li>Coaching management and chairpersons on activities and topics to
							avoid</li>

							<li>We also follow emerging antitrust law and trends on an ongoing basis, and
							meet with regulators to exchange current industry information in support of
							standards development.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						5. External relationships: Consortia frequently enter into variously
						formal and informal relationships with other organizations. We assist them
						by drafting appropriate agreements including:
						<ul>
							<li>Memoranda of Understanding with other standards organizations</li>

							<li>Agreements to submit standards for endorsement or adoption by ISO,
							IEC, etc.</li>

							<li>Trade conference, hotel, and other third party commercial agreements</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						6. Staffing: Whether our clients have dedicated staff or use service
						companies, we assist by:
						<ul>
							<li>Determining market salary and benefit packages, and drafting
							employment offers and separation agreements</li>

							<li>Negotiating service agreements with service companies for the
							provision of administrative and other services</li>

							<li>Documenting appropriate benefits packages</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						7. International: Almost all of our consortium clients operate on a
						global basis. Common ways in which we assist our clients abroad include:
						
						<ul>
							<li>Avoiding appearances of "US Centricity" in order to ensure global
							participation and credibility</li>

							<li>Managing trademark portfolios through trusted partners around the
							world</li>

							<li>Creating international subsidiaries and offices as needed to meet
							national and regional needs</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						8. Coordination and Networking: Over the more than two decades we have
						been representing our consortium clients, we have developed a global
						network of persons of influence and ability. We share these contacts with
						our clients in many ways, including by:

						<ul>
							<li>Introducing our clients to certification labs, test suite developers,
							hosting companies, merger partners, and others</li>

							<li>Locating suitable candidates to fill management positions</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						9. Transactional: We have represented our consortium clients in many
						mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures with other standards and
						promotional bodies. At any time, we are typically involved in one or more
						consortium mergers, or the evaluation of merger opportunities. Our
						services in this area include:

						<ul>
							<li>Evaluating when it is time to discontinue independent existence and
							seek a merger partner</li>

							<li>Structuring transfers of assets to successor organizations in a
							cost-effective manner to minimize time and cash expenditures</li>

							<li>Negotiating favorable terms for members to participate in successor
							organizations</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>II. Costs.</b> The great depth and breadth of our experience allows us to
				provide our services on a highly cost-effective basis. Our high value to
				cost service model is made possible in part by:
				<ul>
					<li>Using the many easily customized templates that we have developed
					over time to serve all common consortium needs, from formation,
					through operations, to eventual dissolution and/or merger</li>

					<li>Maintaining hourly rates below those of other law firms with
					comparable sophistication</li>

					<li>The familiarity that the legal departments of virtually all major
					technology corporations have developed over the years with our
					document templates by becoming members of the many consortia we
					represent</li>

					<li>Our pragmatic approach to legal representation, which is intended to
					give the client what it wants and needs at a cost it can afford</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>III. Industry Involvement and Commitment.</b> Our commitment to best
				practices and the vitality of the standard setting infrastructure is
				unmatched, as demonstrated by the thousands of hours of efforts expended by
				the head of our consortium practice, Andrew Updegrove, including:

				<ul>
					<li>Drafting and filing pro bono "friend of the court" (amicus curiae)
					briefs in important standards litigation in the federal District,
					Circuit, and Supreme Court and before the Federal Trade Commission on
					behalf of dozens of consortia</li>

					<li>Providing invited testimony at joint Department of Justice and
					Federal Trade Commission hearings on intellectual property and
					standard setting</li>

					<li>Testifying before a Congressional subcommittee in support of the role
					of NIST in standards development</li>

					<li>Participating as the sole representative of the consortium community
					on the committee chartered to revise the United States Standards
					Strategy</li>

					<li>Serving on the Boards of Directors of the American National Standards
					Institute (ANSI), Free Standards Group and Linux Foundation, and on
					the Boards of Advisors of HL7 and Open Software for America</li>

					<li>Creating ConsortiumInfo.org, a free, public resource that serves over
					1 million page views per month with multiple features, including the
					largest on-line: library of standards literature, archive of
					standards related news articles, and directory of consortia</li>

					<li>Publishing Standards Today, a free eJournal of standards-related
					news, ideas and analysis received by over 7,000 subscribers, now in
					its 60th issue (Updegrove received the 2005 President's Award for
					Journalism from ANSI in recognition of his writing)</li>

					<li>We invite you to learn more about our consortium, standards and open source
					practice by visiting the consortium practice page at our firm website, or
					by contacting Andrew Updegrove at 617/350-6800, or
					andrew.updegrove@gesmer.com</li>
