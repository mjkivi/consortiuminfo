			<img border="0" style="float: left; width: 155px; margin: 5px 10px 8px 0;" alt="Andy Updegrove" src="../images/andy.jpg">Andrew Updegrove is a founding partner of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, a Boston-based technology law firm.  He has a broad range of experience in 
			representing both mature and emerging high technology companies of all types in all aspects of their legal affairs. Since 1988, he has also 
			represented and helped structure more than 115 worldwide standard setting, open source, research and development, promotional and advocacy 
			consortia, including some of the largest standard setting organizations in the world.  He spends a significant part of his time giving strategic 
			advice to clients of the firm. 
		</p>
		<p class="story">
			His leadership in standards related matters is widely recognized. In 2005 he was elected to the Boards of Directors of the American National 
			Standards Institute (ANSI) and in 2005 to the Free Standards Group (FSG), and in 2007 to the Board of Directors of the Linux Foundation.  He 
			is also a past member of the Board of Advisors of HL7, an ANSI accredited developer of electronic health standards for clinical and administrative 
			data, a current Board of Advisors member of Open Source for America, a group promoting the use of open source software by government, and a charter 
			Fellow of the OpenForum Academy, a sister organization to OpenForum Europe, an organization promoting the use of open standards throughout Europe.  
			In 2004, he was the sole representative of the consortium community to be appointed as a member of the United States National Standards Strategy Committee. 
		</p>
		<p class="story">
			He has been retained by many of the largest corporations in the world to assist in setting up international consortia, and by both multinational 
			companies as well as government agencies to advise them in setting their standards-related policies and goals.  He has also provided testimony to 
			the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission on standard setting and intellectual property rights, and written and filed pro bono “friend of the court” 
			briefs in major standards-related litigation before the Federal Circuit Court, the Supreme Court, and the Federal Trade Commission.  In 2010, he provided 
			testimony on the future of the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) to the House Committee on Science and Technology's Subcommittee on Technology 
			and Innovation.
		</p>
		<p class="story">
			In May of 2002, he conceived and launched ConsortiumInfo.org, an extensive website intended to provide the most comprehensive and detailed source of news and 
			information on the Internet on standard-setting, open source software project development, and forming and maintaining consortia.  The site serves up to a million 
			page views a month to a global audience, including up to 50,000 visitors a month from China.  In December of 2002, he conceived and launched the Consortium Standards 
			Bulletin (now Standards Today), a bi-monthly eJournal of news, ideas and analysis on standard setting. Standards Today is sent to a large and rapidly growing list 
			of standards professionals and other subscribers at major corporations, government agencies and universities throughout the world. Other sections of the site include
			the Standards MetaLibrary, with over 1,800 categorized and abstracted articles, and the Standards Blog, which attracts up to 100,000 visitors a month. Besides his 
			efforts at the ConsortiumInfo.org Website, he writes and speaks frequently both domestically and internationally on topics involving standards, open source software 
			and consortia.  In 2005 he was selected to receive the ANSI President’s Award for Journalism for his work at ConsortiumInfo.org and Standards Today.

			Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council.
