In that case, a building code referenced a standard, and the plaintiff objected to the practical necessity of purchasing a copy of a standard to which he was legally bound to conform.  Since most accredited standard setting bodies have low membership fees, they derive a significant amount of their operating budgets from the sale of copies of standards.  Hence, any requirement to give away their standards would force them to adjust their business model.  Although the holding in the Veeck case would not impact all standards, even if it was applied nation-wide, the potential for expanding the doctrine beyond its facts and legal rationale has helped place the case in the limelight.  \r\n\r\nRecently, the Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal from the lower court hearing in Veeck, and therefore its holding remains binding in the Fifth Circuit - as well as a precedent which courts in other circuits may decide to follow, even if they are not bound to do so.  As a result of the Supreme Court deciding not to hear the appeal, uncertainty will reign for the indefinite future.  As noted in the brief filed by the defending standards body in the case, "Does the government’s decision to make the copyrighted proposals binding place the copyrighted material in the public domain? The First Circuit said maybe. The Second and Ninth Circuits said no. And nine of fifteen Fifth Circuit judges said yes.” \r\n\r\nThe following article from the ANSI site provides a review of this last stage in the progress of the Veeck case up the judicial ladder. \r\n\r\n', 'U.S. Supreme Court Decides Not to Adjudicate Appeal in SBCCI v.

In the final development of the case, the United States Supreme Court has decided not to hear an appeal from the Fifth Circuit’s decision, thereby leaving it intact as legal precedent with regard to this issue.

In doing so, it is playing catch-up to Windows, which has offered add-on features available for the disabled since the mid-1990s. The non-profit group will encourage Linux developers to make their software work with a standard version of Linux. That standard version in turn will be compatible with software and hardware developed for disabled people.\r\n', '', 'http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1620&ncid=1817&e=1&u=/sv/20040121/tc_sv/disabledtogetgreateraccesstolinux', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'No', 0);

TTTech formed a consortium, and Motorola''s semiconductor products sector and others were early members.  Later, the major automotive companies formed the FlexRay consortium, partly out of intellectual property concerns with TTTech. FlexRay has become the dominant standard, with early silicon already on the market.', '', 'http://www.eet.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=159900247', '', '', '', 11, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'No', 0);

GPL 3 is likely to include\r\nchanges that take into account international copyright law and patent\r\nthreats, according to Moglen. It is not surprising that the next \r\nversion\r\nof the GPL has attracted a lot of interest as it is the basis for a\r\n''multibillion-dollar industry,'' according to Moglen. He was unable to\r\nsay when GPL 3 would be released, though he suggested that it would be\r\navailable in the next year or two. He is confident that when GPL 3 is\r\nreleased, people will be pleased with the outcome.', '', 'http://news.com.com/2100-7344_3-5637496.html', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'No', 0);

Actually, it should ring several bells.  Here''s why.', 'If the following story rings a bell, it should.  Actually, it should ring several bells.  Here''s why.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nAccording to InfoWorld in a story titled <a href=''http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/08/HNwssecurityapache_1.html''>\r\n  Apache faces Web services security spec roadblock</a>, the Apache Foundation wants to include WS-Security, an OASIS standard, in its open source Axis SOAP stack, and Microsoft wants to preclude relicensing of products that implement WS-Security (although it is willing to license its patents relating to WS-Security on a royalty-free basis directly to both end-users as well as the initial developers).  IBM reserved similar rights relating to its own patents that would be infringed by implementations of the standard. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe first reason this should sound familiar is that in September of last year the IETF shut down its MARID (MTA Authorization Records In DNS) working group, which was intending to include another security feature in a specification it was working on.  That specification was Sender ID, of which Microsoft was a co-developer.  Unfortunately, Microsoft was asserting a similar licensing restriction, to which Apache (among many other open source groups) objected.  Much <i>sturm und drang</i>  followed, with more stops, starts, skirmishes and concessions transpiring than it makes sense to cover here.  Suffice it to say that neither side was having much fun.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe second controversy this story should call to mind is the simmering dispute over the convergence between open source licensing terms and those that have been historically tolerable in the world of open standards.  That clash reached a high (or low) point earlier this year with the sending of an open <a href=''http://perens.com/Articles/OASIS.html''>Call to Action</a> letter from 29 prominent open source advocates to OASIS at the time that OASIS adopted a revised intellectual property rights (IPR) policy that was intended to be more open source friendly (see the March issue of our Consortium Standards Bulletin, <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/mar05.php''>What Does "Open" Mean?</a>).   The action called for was a boycott of OASIS standards and process until OASIS amended its IPR policy to the signatoriesâ€™ satisfaction. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhat each of these stories highlights is the fact that there are two consensus systems in use today that end users like you and me wish need to work together productively and efficiently, but which haven''t yet fully worked out how to do so.  On the one hand, the open source community has a dynamite development and licensing model, and on the other hand, the open standards community has a venerable and useful model of its own that has enabled the modern technology world that in turn gave birth to the open source model.  That traditional model (which applies to every possible product and service domain) permits licensing terms that are non-problematic in other domains, but which are not simpatico with the open source model, which (to date) applies almost exclusively to software.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nAll would be fine, were it not for the fact that it would be unthinkably inefficient for open source software to have nothing to do with open standards.  And, in truth, traditional open standards users would be delighted if open standards required neither licenses nor royalties â€“ but those that develop open standards simply have not been asked in the past by their constituencies to require the same degree of IPR sacrifice in the vast majority of standard setting situations as their brethren in the open source world require in all projects.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe big divide is between ideology and market forces.  Among open source advocates, licensing terms are a matter of principle, while in the open standards community, licensing terms are matters of pure dollars and cents.  If market forces lead towards royalty free GNU licensing, then those terms will become staples in open software standards.  Personally, I believe that itâ€™s only a matter of time before this happens, at least in some software areas (and eventually, perhaps, in most).  Another way of saying it is that when open source software becomes more important than proprietary software, then a tipping point will be passed at which the vendors themselves will be the ones that demand GNU terms even before they are asked to offer them.  Many major vendors are already at, or approaching that point.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo what do those at Apache do while they await the proverbial tipping point?  One can expect that IBM, which has placed huge strategic bets on open source, will work things out speedily and amicably with Apache.  But what of Microsoft, which, at least superficially, has little reason to do anything to encourage the spread of open source software?<br/><p/>\r\n\r\nWell, we can still hope for progress there.  Why?  Here are a few reasons.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nFirst, the world already overwhelmingly relies on Apache servers, and Microsoft isn''t likely to spend its resources trying to reverse that reality.  Second, Microsoft has had enough bad press over the years regarding security issues, so it will be better off if WS-Security is broadly implemented.  Third, there are doubtless numerous benefits that Microsoft must expect from WS-Security becoming ubiquitous (with or without the licensing term in question) that should offset the concession of dropping the offending term.  Also, Microsoft doesn''t need any more headaches in open-source bullish Europe, which continues to press Microsoft on antitrust grounds whenever it can.  And finally, Microsoft is spending more and more time setting up joint strategies with historically strange bedfellows such as IBM and Sun â€“ both of which are firmly on the open source bandwagon.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nI can''t predict the specifics of what will happen next, but I do think that a lot of water has flowed over the dam since this time last year, when the IETF threw up its hands and shut down MARID.  If this new situation resolves itself quickly, it will be a sign that the initially clashing open source/open standards gears are starting to grind themselves into an alignment that may, perhaps sooner rather than later, begin to hum.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhen that happens, we all win.  I''m looking forward to it.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

In that piece, he was doing a good job of demonstrating how much more economically (in this case) government agencies could deploy their IT budgets on highly skilled software engineers instead of highly expensive software that would still require expensive maintenance.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut then Hall said something that brought the whole effect down, and inevitably reminded me of an <a href=''http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/arts/design/10RWilson.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1121122274-xr2CDjydNoJwnAn89dTIdg''>obituary</a> that I''d read the same morning.  That obituary recounted the passing of a familiar cartoonist, one Rowland B. Wilson, and if you are (how to say diplomatically) of a certain age, you''ll remember him by his most famous series of work.  That series was a run of ads some thirty-odd years ago for the New England Life Insurance Company, and always featured two characters.  The first would be standing or seated comfortably, with a self-satisfied look on his face.  The second would have a horrified look on his face as he watched a wrecking ball, enormous safe, or perhaps a run-away train rushing to annihilate his smug friend, who was always uttering the punch line.  Which was, "My insurance company?  Why New England Life, of course." (badda-boom!)<br/><p>\r\n\r\nSo what could that possibly have to do with an interview where a prominent open source proponent is trying to reach across the divide to address the concerns of commercial customers that are used to buying software from large and (seemingly) secure IT companies?  Well, you tell me.  Here''s the line that was supposed to demonstrate the advantages of open source software:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nOpen-source code gives you control. If a project leader of a particular open-source project dies, you can make a business decision to switch to something else or hire someone to maintain that package until youâ€™re finished with it. With closed-source software, that business decision is taken away from you.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAh.  Got it.  If the project manager dies, and the project team evaporates, I''ll just hire someone off the street to run my mission critical software for me, which I''ll still want to migrate off of eventually anyway.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe point, of course, is that making open source software ubiquitous, like (sadly) anything and everything else in the world, is a matter of marketing.  And the first principle of marketing is Know Thy Customer.  So yes, it''s true that having a back door to a legacy system dead end issue is reassuring (in a way), but it''s a bit like telling the guy who''s about to be annihilated by the wrecking ball, safe or train: "Good news!  You won''t be dead, just a paraplegic!"  To switch metaphors, the customer really doesn''t want what''s behind either Door A or Door B.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nInstead, what Hall''s quote really does is expose one of the things that open source still needs (and certainly can) work out, which is its willingness to follow Benevolent Dictators.  All may indeed be well while the dictator is busy being actively benevolent, but when he or she is busy being retired or dead, its not a great system from the customer''s point of view.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nHopefully, those who don''t like open source won''t think to revive the old Howland Wilson ad formula to dis open source.  But open source should spend some time refining the open source model to give customers more of a warm and fuzzy feeling about the long-term viability of the development projects upon which they are being asked to bet their businesses.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Two reactions:...', 'David Berlind over at <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1597''>ZDNet Blogs<a/> has picked up on my \r\n<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1379''>Apache/WS-Security post</a> of a few days ago and quoted me extensively on why I think that Microsoft will play ball with Apache.  David also reiterates his contention that, where a consortium has more than one track (e.g., RAND as well as royalty free), itâ€™s misleading for people to be able to say "We''re an X standard," possibly giving the impression that they are royalty free when in fact they took the RAND option.  David goes on to suggest a color-coded rating system that would offer a rainbow ranking of "openness."<br/></p>\r\n\r\nTwo reactions:  First, the idea of having greater clarity in what a given imprimatur means is a good one, particularly since the details can vary so widely.  In fact, you could take it even farther than David has, because the commitments that a participant in standard setting is required to make can have a lot of trapdoors (e.g., "we pledge to license all patents that our representative knows about," which is pretty thin gruel in the guarantee department when a big company is the member).  One could imagine a "truth in standards" checklist where the organization would be encouraged to indicate which terms it did and did not include in its IPR policy.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nMy second reaction, though, is that anyone who has knocked around in the standards area at all knows that policies are different enough that if it''s important enough to care, you''d better go look at the policy.  So whether a given standard setting organization had one IPR option or three, youâ€™d still better find out what the rules are before you take your product to the market.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nMy <a href=''http://www.zdnet.com/5208-10532-0.html?forumID=1&threadID=11822&messageID=235193&start=-1''>response</a> at the ZDNet site addresses the question from a different perspective, providing some historical context for why I think it will take the market a while to get to where David is anxious to see it go.  I''ll skip the long stage-setting, but here are the conclusions I ended with:<br/></p>\r\n\r\nFirst, and most importantly, it just takes time to teach old dogs new tricks. To some people, the kind of licensing terms open source wants seem like lunacy, because they are so different from what they grew up with. So a lot of the urgency in your comments may be understandable from the "we need this now!" perspective, but it isn''t really too realistic when many people just can''t see it yet. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo second, there''s an educational question. People have to understand it and get comfortable with it before they can support it. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThird, there''s that convergence thing. Your idea about labeling "how open" a standard is may seem obvious, but bear in mind that until recently standards people lived in stovepipes. People who needed to know which organizations put out standards of multiple flavors did know, and they didn''t need labels. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhich takes me to my fourth and final point: The reason that people are talking about standards today is because the damn things actually work now. When I started working with consortia 18 years ago, standards were something that lots of people talked about, and nobody really believed in. Today, with the Internet and the Web, standards are things that *have* to work in order for us to do anything at all. So people have no choice but to believe in them and make them work. They even get advertised to boost the appeal of consumer products now(like WiFi and Bluetooth enabled devices). <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo today, standards are more strategic than ever, and more important than ever. So guess what? People are going to start hyping and exaggerating them just like they do about every technical aspect of a product. One might say it''s an indication that standards have finally "made it." <br/></p>\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The latest is that David Berlind pinged Larry Rosen to get his thoughts (or vice-versa), and David stitched a blog entry together around my responses (and post title) there and here and Larry''s reaction called <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1607''> Larry Rosen:  ''Good Time'' not fast enough for open source/standards</a>  Part of Larry''s email quoted by David goes as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is not about convincing companies and standards organizations that open source is right or humane or a profitable business model. It is about demanding that our programmers and our customers be allowed to implement and use software standards without having to pay our friends (e.g., currently IBM) or our enemies (e.g., currently Microsoft) for the pleasure of doing so. "Open standards" is a corollary to "open source." Ultimately we can''t have the latter without the former. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nMy response (<a ref=''http://www.zdnet.com/5208-10532-0.html?forumID=1&threadID=11847&messageID=235869&start=-1''>"Realism is often useful")</a> tries to point out that it not only matters where you get, but how you get there.  Open standards have a century-long history of consensus process based on the concept that everybody wins if everyone agrees.  I''d rather live, I conclude, in a consensus system than a "take no prisoners" system where you try and roll the opposition.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhich is not, of course, to say that in traditional standard setting people don''t play hard, sometimes cheat, and always (if they''re smart) keep an eye on the other guys that have a reputation for pushing the envelope.  But still, the system *works*, and works a lot better than a lot of other political systems (which of course it is), such as in Washington, the U.N., or most other examples you can think of.  The reason?  Because ultimately everyone is better off when the system works, and they know it.<br/></p>\r\n	\r\nSo I''ll stick with a consensus system with a track record.  I''m perfectly happy to allow the momentum that''s building behind open source to continue to find its manifest destiny at its own speed.  People aren''t starving or dying because open source isn''t spreading more quickly (heavens knows they are for enough other reasons).  I''d rather honor process values and go for a win/win that''s durable, then a win/lose that sets dangerous precedents and may be less stable. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAs David quoted from my email to him: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nActually, what I was talking about in the post (although it may not have been clear) was also the people involved in setting standards, and standards strategy.  First they have to believe it, then they have to learn about it, then they have to plan strategy around it, then they have to execute.  I wouldn''t be surprised if 10 years from now someone is writing business case studies examining how something so radical happened so fast.  Things may seem slow in the moment that, from a historical and a human nature perspective, are actually moving at warp speed.  It takes a long time to turn a fleet of battleships around.  In this case, many of them are making amazingly tight turns.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOr, as I concluded in my response to the Larry Rosen post (referring to an open  letter that Larry had written to the other 28 OASIS letter authors, in which he rather unrealistically claimed credit for them for IBM''s announcement that it would not assert 500 patents against open source): <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Larry, achieving consensus through an honorable process does take a little time. As I wrote in an email to you awhile back, there are a lot of changes taking place in the marketplace. But when big changes occur in the marketplace (like pitching patents into the common pool), itâ€™s not because OASIS got a letter from 29 people. Itâ€™s because IBM and other companies figured they wanted to bet on open source. So ultimately, educating companies on why they should want open source is going to get you where you want to go much faster than calling boycotts. And yes, education does take time.<br/><p>\r\n\r\nOne has to be careful with causes and effects. What moves the world on a long-term basis isnâ€™t threats. Its reason. Sometimes effects coincide with events â€“ like letters â€“ but that doesnâ€™t make a letter a cause. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIâ€™d like to not only get to an open source world, but I''d like to get there the right way.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<i>Note:  this blog is home-built, and we went live before all features were added.

My real concern here, though, comes from the fact that political processes need to work, and it''s not easy to get political systems to work, as the papers daily show. The standards process does work, even though (unlike an open source project) it brings together people with much more divergent viewpoints.  That''s important, and difficult to do.  It involves more compromises than does reaching agreement among only like-minded individuals.<br/><p>       \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother way that it''s hard not to use words like "hijack" if you need an accurate descriptor is where I started here yesterday, which is that every definition of "open standards" world-wide has always included "consensus" as the first and foremost attribute - it may be the only attribute that everyone has always agreed on.<br/><p>       \r\n\r\n\r\nSo how is a demand consistent with the concept of "open standards?"

Those who argue most strongly for open source have no great love for big companies, who obviously hold a lot of power.

This model is a complete overhaul of the existing system with both existing overseers ICANN and the US government relegated to supporting roles. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<b>Model 2:</b>  An "enhanced role" for ICANN''s Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). ICANN would stay in its current role and even be significantly strengthened thanks to the general world consensus. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<b>Model 3:</b>  An International Internet Council (IIC) to be set up that would take over the US government''s role but not be an explicit part of the UN.

Divorcing patent claim interpretation from traditional factual inquiry meant two things. First, it meant that judges, not juries, were responsible for deciding what the terminology used in a patent claim actually meant. Second, it meant that a court hearing an appeal of that determination (i.e., the Federal Circuit) need not\r\ngive any deference to the trial courtâ€™s conclusions.

Does a company like Google have to commit to semantic browsing before the Semantic Web takes off? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nTBL: I think that for many companies it may be that the killer app is an intranet. Many of the early WWW servers were inside the firewalls. The valuable data is company-confidential, and it is much safer to experiment with new technology in private! One computer company had, I think, 100 web servers internally before it had a public one. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, guess what?  It looks like Fujitsu thinks so too.

Called the Business Information Navigator, Fujitsu''s (Profile, Products, Articles) tool seeks to use this metadata to spot relationships between documents spread throughout an organization and deliver search results that are more focused than is currently possible with a simple text search. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe idea is that with better tagging and more metadata, such as XML (extensible markup language) and RDF (resource description framework), an enterprise could derive much more value from its data. Fujitsu''s Navigator will both run through the documents and attempt to automatically tag them and works as a search engine for this tagged data.  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs previously promised, I''ll continue to cover evidence of the roll out of the Semantic Web.

Will it be union and management (I hope not)?  Amateur and pro athelete (Marc Fleury thinks so)? [more]', 'A week ago I noted an article at the Techworld site that I wanted to come back to, because it highlights an imbalance that can resolve in a number of ways in the future.  The article is called <a href=''http://www.techworld.com/opsys/features/index.cfm?featureid=1588''>An open letter to the open source community</a>. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a typical "here''s what we need from you guys" type article from the end-user perspective, directed at the open source development community.  Try a Google search using the same title and you''ll find several others from the same perspective and making the same points.  All of which gets me thinking about where things may head for the open source community and the end-user in the future. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nHere are a few musings on that question, based on some historical examples of different types of power relationships that are in one way or the other relevant, although none of them is totally on point.  Still, a more-or-less-accurate augury of the future might theoretically be assembled by using these (and certainly other) analogues, using these as a starting point:  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i><b>Will it be like unions and management? </i></b>  Throughout the Industrial Revolution, management acquired near-total control of the production process and reaped nearly all of the benefits on the backs of the workers that typically worked long hours in unsafe conditions.  Eventually, the union movement came about to redress the balance of power.  Today, over a hundred years later, the relationship between management and labor is still highly charged and distrustful, with far more of a â€œwin/loseâ€ rather than a â€œwin/winâ€ dynamic.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThis doesnâ€™t seem to be where things will end up for developers and end-users, because itâ€™s not where things began.  So far, the end-users, and more and more vendors, are looking at open source as an opportunity and not a threat, and the atmosphere has been highly collaborative.  But thereâ€™s always the possibility that things could diverge in the future as the stakes and the dependencies grow higher. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i><b>Will it be like amateur and pro sports? </i></b>  Until recent decades, anyway, amateurs were really amateurs, and really went for the gold medal, rather than the golden endorsement contract, while pro players had similar, but in important ways also different,  goals, including filling the stands so that owners could fill playersâ€™ pockets as well as their own. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIf the open source community does not provide what the end-users want (and what vendors, like pro team owners, therefore want to provide), thereâ€™s the possibility that there may be one licensing model, but two developer communities.  One could be the pure developer community (â€œhereâ€™s what we want to buildâ€) and the other could be the more hard-core commercial community of vendors and end-users (â€œhereâ€™s what we want to buy and sellâ€).  Or, as Marc Fleury of JBoss would not very diplomatically have it, an â€œamateurâ€ and a â€œprofessionalâ€ community.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIâ€™d be surprised if there is not some of this reality in the future.  After all, there already is today (certainly Marc thinks so), if you look at the most economically important open source projects.  True, there may be hundreds of people that are technically part of a particular development community, but most of the actual work is often done by a much smaller group of individuals, the majority of whom are employees of large companies that want to influence the results and have the biggest headstart.  And then thereâ€™s SourceForge, where just the opposite is true.  So will things continue in this fashion, or go farther?  My bet is on farther. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i><b>Will it be like architects and owners? </i></b>  When I left for college, I thought I was going to be an architect (the bricks and mortar kind).  One reason I switched majors was that I was turned off by the â€œartisteâ€ hubris of many of the architects of the day, who thought that their birthright to design Great Art Buildings (which were often also uncomfortable, inefficient and impractical buildings), and it was their clients obligation to pay the bills and live and work in what they were given.  Thereâ€™s certainly something of that today, where an open source community decides what it wants to work on, and can (and often does) care more about what they think the end-user should want, rather than what the end-user actually does want. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i><b> Will it be like libertarians and conservatives? </i></b>  Libertarians want maximum freedom from government restrictions.  Conservatives generally want government off their backs in some cases, but want government at their backs in others (such as making recreational drugs illegal, even though that means that government will be telling people what they can and canâ€™t do).  That means that libertarians come out the same way as conservatives some times (as in believing that less government means better government), and not in others (as in objecting to drug control).  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOpen source advocates have a core set of beliefs that often does coincide with the desires of end-users (avoid lock in and the risk of abandonment) but not in others (consistency and reliability is desirable to end-users in many respects, even if it restricts freedom of design). <br/></p>\r\n\r\nDoes any of this matter?  I think so.  The march of open source into the commercial world has been one of the most fascinating and hopeful intellectual revolutions in my lifetime.  But revolutions have a nasty history of coming out the wrong way when the glorydays of the barricades is followed up by the tedious process of actually governing disparate interest groups.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nItâ€™s worth looking back to learn from the past, and looking ahead to plan for the future.  Understanding the relationships between developers and end-users, and planning ways to satisfy both, is a good way to make sure that that future is a happy one for all concerned.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Our temporal destination for today:  October, 1991! <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAs we emerge into the past, we see the presidents of Apple Computer, Motorola, and IBM high-fiving each other on stage as they announce that they have signed a landmark technology sharing accord.  Under that agreement, IBM and Apple will jointly develop the PowerOpen Specification, based on IBM''s AIX operating system and the â€œPowerPCâ€ RISC chip designed by IBM.  Motorola will fab the chip, Apple will use it in its Macintosh line, and Big Blue will base its RS/6000 workstation on the same chip as well.  With everyone on the same platform, ISVs should (they hope) find it worth their while to rapidly port software to the new platform, and end-users will have something to run on their shiny new boxes.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThus, in one fell swoop, the three partners hope that they will finally be able to break the WinTel industry stranglehold, outflank Sunâ€™s own RISC based SPARC Station initiative, revive Motorolaâ€™s and Appleâ€™s fortunes by replacing the Motorola 6800 silicon line with a hot new processor, and leapfrog Motorolaâ€™s sputtering 88000 RISC chip effort, which Apple had never bought into.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThey also form the PowerOpen Consortium (modeled on the 88open Consortium, which I helped form in February of 1988).  PowerOpen would create standards to make it even easier for platform vendors to design computers based on (and therefore commit to) the PowerPC chip line, and for ISVs to port software to the PowerPC architecture. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOK, back briefly into our trusty time travel pod, and fast-forward a year.  The presidents of all three companies are now gone, and (to a greater or lesser extent) all three companies are now backpedaling away from the alliance (and from Taligent, the licensing company that they had also formed).  By then, 88open had petered out, and I was now representing the PowerOpen Consortium, which I continued to do until it, too, died quietly in the dark. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAll right, enough of that.  Letâ€™s head back to the future/today, and what do we see? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that there are supposed to be no second acts in America, we seeâ€¦a new PowerPC consortium, this time called <a href=''http://www.power.org/home''>Power.org</a>  And this time, the organization isnâ€™t about creating standards on top of a proprietary architecture.  This time, itâ€™s about â€œopen hardware.â€ <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOpen hardware??  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nYes, open hardware.  What a difference a decade, and an open source software movement, can make. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe new PowerPC organizationâ€™s mission has the same basic business goals as before (bring the industry away from one architecture and onto another), but the strategy now is not to get end users to switch from one proprietary platform to another, but to switch off a proprietary platform entirely to one thatâ€™s commonly controlled.

Well, it has a start, with Power.org.  Or perhaps a stop and start, given that Power.org entered the game not long before the Open Source Programmable Logic initiative went down.  (And speaking of down, the Open Cores site <http://www.opencores.org> is either down (or gone) tonight as I write this.)  But the early signs are that Power.org is off to a vigorous start, with Novell, Red Hat, Sony, Cadence and many others (besides IBM) as members. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo what does â€œopenâ€ mean when weâ€™re talking about hardware?  That may still be evolving, even within IBM.  Notwithstanding the Power.org effort, Juan-Antonio Carballo, partner in IBM''s venture capital group, is quoted in an <a href='' http://www.eetasia.com/ARTICLES/2005JUL/C/2005JUL_ART_WK4.HTM''>article in Electronic Engineering Times</a> as making â€œan eloquent pitch for open hardwareâ€ at the Electronic Design Processes workshop last month.  In that pitch, he is quoted as saying: "The open-source model is quickly extending from software to hardware, and it will provide a similar swell of collaborative innovation.â€  But the article goes on to say: <blockquote> \r\nThe word "open" has various meanings, Carballo explained. It includes but is not limited to open source, where specifications or source code are freely available and can be modified by a community of users. It could also mean that the hardware details can be viewed, but not modified. And it does not necessarily mean that open hardware, or designs that contain it, are free of charge. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, I guess if people ever get tired of their polite exchange of ideas about what â€œopenâ€ means in the software arena, theyâ€™ll have plenty of opportunity to engage in some friendly debate over in hardware land. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nStay tuned.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

First, just about everyone agrees that they are <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov03.php#newscluster''>too easy to get, and too hard to challenge</a>.  And second, because recently they have begun to cause more and more problems in important collaborative processes.  Those processes, of course, are open source software development, which has only recently captured sufficient commercial importance to attract the negative notice of some patent holders, and open standards, because of the increasing number of patents that have been awarded that can be cited against software standards. <br></p>\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been around for longer than we like to admit will remember that even after software patents became available, few pure software companies bothered to get them (hardware companies that already had strong patent cultures pursued them far sooner).  Startup companies, for example, were rarely encouraged to get patents by their venture capital backers until the Internet Bubble years, when finding enough uses for the huge investment rounds that bloated VC funds wanted to cram into startups became an actual problem (remember startup company Super Bowl ads?)  Prior to that era, copyright and trade secret protection were deemed to be more than adequate to protect an investorâ€™s interests, and even a successful startup wouldnâ€™t be able to fund a broad program of patent infringement litigation, anyway. <br></p>\r\n\r\nOf course, anyone who doesn''t already have a large patent portfolio can''t play the game as effectively.  If you hear echoes of an arms race (only this time with patents), you''re on the right track. <br></p>\r\n\r\nToday, of course, we are well past a tipping point in this regard.  Even though VC investment rounds are back to more historical dimensions, IPO opportunities remain elusive.  As a result, VCs must increasingly look to acquisitions by larger players to find liquidity, and they know that strategic patents can boost the value of a portfolio company on sale.  And for large companies, patents are deemed to be more and more important â€“ not always (or even primarily) for offensive purposes, but for defensive purposes.  In other words, if you have enough patents, you have â€œfreedom of movement,â€ because anyone who says that you are infringing one of their patents is likely to be infringing one of yours as well. <br></p>\r\n\r\nSo should software patents be swept away entirely, or should the system be reformed, by making software patents harder to get, easier to challenge, and perhaps of shorter duration as well?  On a net basis, getting rid of them is probably the better result.  <br></p>\r\n\r\nBut when imagining new worlds, itâ€™s important to imagine all consequences of a change, both unintended as well as intended.  In that respect, consider this:  if Apple hadnâ€™t slipped up in a license with Microsoft, Microsoft could never have launched windows with a graphical user interface that mimicked Appleâ€™s breakthrough GUI.  And if Dan Bricklin had been able to patent Visicalc, Microsoft would never have been able to launch Excel.  <br></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn each case, the assertion of patent rights could (at least theoretically) have prevented the successful exercise of brute force that monopoly power can enable to the detriment of other types of creativity in the marketplace. <br></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSo -- would we be better off today if patents had been used to block each of these strategic moves by Microsoft?  And might we be better off in the future with a reformed patent law, and patent owners that are willing to contribute needed rights to a â€œpatent commonsâ€ for open source and open standards purposes (probably a more feasible objective, at least in the short term)?  <br></p>\r\n\r\nInteresting questions.\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

My, but it does get tedious living in a world filled with experts.', 'The New York Times is once again a source of metaphorical inspiration for me on the topic of open standards, and this time it''s negative inspiration.  Another source of such head-shaking for me today is a jeremiad focused on the same Sunday NYT article that served as the jumping off point for my last Blog entry, entitled <a href='' http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/business/yourmoney/31digi.html?''>Why Bill Gates Wants 3,000 Patents</a>   This one comes from Greg Aharonian, a commentator on patent issues, in his free <i>Internet Patent News Service</i> which, besides presenting information from a wide variety of sources regarding patents, includes â€œbiting commentary if I happen to be in a lousy mood that morning.â€ (Access is by <a href='' http://www.ibiblio.org/patents/ipnsinfo.html''>free subscription</a>) <br></p> \r\n\r\nLetâ€™s start with the fun one, a brief piece in Tuesdayâ€™s <i>Science Times</i> section called <i>Caterpillars that Could Use Herb Butter </i> (there is no current working link).  The main point here is not that there are caterpillars on Maui that trap and eat snails, but the reaction of a scientist as described in the article when confronted with the reality of the voracious, 1/3 inch nemesis of gastropods.  The following is quoted from the short Times item: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Rubinoffâ€¦first heard about these caterpillars <i>from naturalists on Maui</i>, he didnâ€™t imagine that they were actually eating snails.  He took some caterpillars to his lab and tried feeding them carrots, algae and lichens, but they refused everything.  Then he gave one a small land snail. <i>[emphasis added]</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, you can figure out what happened next.  But not the good Dr. Rubinoff, who of course had only been told that this would happen by naturalists that were familiar with the creature.  Instead, he â€œknewâ€ that the caterpillar would not actually eat the snail.  The article continues: â€œAt first he didnâ€™t believe what he was seeing.  â€™I thought it was a freak individual,â€™ he said.â€ <br></p>\r\n\r\nWell, that would be the most likely explanation -- a freak event that conforms to a  description from a knowledgeable and reputable source.  What a coincidence! <br></p>\r\n\r\nAfter watching other caterpillars weave cocoons around snails and then eat their captives alive (one caterpillar ate five snails in five days), Dr. Rubinoff and his co-author finally accepted reality, shouted Eureka! and wrote their â€œdiscoveryâ€ up for the prestigious journal <i>Science </i>. <br></p>\r\n\r\nNow letâ€™s look to the more mundane â€œbiting commentaryâ€ (read: screed) by Gregory Aharonian, who obviously did not jump out of bed Sunday morning yelling â€œHuzzah!â€   Instead, he refers to the â€œ3,000 Patentsâ€ piece as a â€œparody of historical journalismâ€ written, as he repeatedly notes, by â€œRandall Stross (who ?????)â€  True, Aharonian out-scores Stross at Google by more than two to one, but Stross still pulls a respectable 4, 850 hits.  Regardless, suffice it to say that Mr. Aharonian takes exception with Strossâ€™ opinion that software shouldnâ€™t be patented, and presents detailed historical support for his position, showing why events are transpiring in what he believes is a predicitable and appropriate fashion. <br></p>\r\n\r\nJust to round out the picture, Iâ€™ll reference David Berlindâ€™s series of posts on the relation of open standards to open source.  In his <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1668''> most recent post in this series</a> he refers to one standards group (OASIS) with 85 active technical committees as a â€œso-called standards consortiumâ€ because its intellectual property rights policy does not mandate that all of its standards meet open source requirements (never mind that many of its standards are not of interest for open source applications). <br></p>\r\n\r\nAll right, so whatâ€™s my point? <br></p>\r\n\r\nOnly this:  if there are two widely held positions, each side is probably aware of facts, needs and insights that have some validity and value to stakeholders that need to be understood and accommodated to some appropriate extent, lest more harm than good be achieved (I obviously exclude racism and other bias-based beliefs from this proposition).  Sometimes, that harm can even be to yourself (e.g., if you are a snail and refuse to believe that caterpillars can eat snails, I would suggest that you drop Maui from your vacation plans). <br></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing that every law student was taught from day one of law school when I was there was not to assume anything until you know as much as possible, and not to bring pre-conceived notions to the table.  First, you deconstruct the situation, then you analyze it, then you come up with appropriate conclusions.  In the case of legal holdings, these conclusions are expected to evolve over time.  <br></p>\r\n\r\nThis is something that has not been done in any of the situations described above.  To review:  <ul>\r\n\r\n<li> Our entomologist friend â€œknewâ€ that caterpillars canâ€™t be carnivorous (never mind what other professionals already familiar with the species told him) <br></p>\r\n\r\n<li>  Our patent professional â€œknowsâ€ that patents must be the way to go with software, because he has a deep knowledge of patent history and lives in a world where patents are how you manage things, and always will <br></p>\r\n\r\n<li>  Our NYT journalist â€œknowsâ€ that patents must not be awarded for software inventions, because he''s decided that this is a good thing without (as contended by Aharonian) looking into whether that conclusion is supported by history <br></p>\r\n\r\n<li>  Our ZDNet journalist â€œknowsâ€ that the thousands of standards development organizations, some of which have been around for over 100 years, must throw away their definitions of open standards and conform to what the new open source orthodoxy requires, because he believes that anything that is necessary to facilitate the emergence of open source must be done </ul>\r\n\r\nAll of these individuals, by the way, are extremely bright people that make excellent points to support their arguments. <br></p>\r\n  \r\nPersonally, Iâ€™m an avid open source fan; I agree that open standards and open source need to be brought into alignment (where necessary, and not where they don''t intersect); Iâ€™m not a fan of software patents as they are today (and perhaps software patents at all); Iâ€™m trying to encourage both camps to listen to each other and understand each others'' positions (and valid concerns); and Iâ€™m interested in finding the best solution, rather than a specific solution. <br></p>\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Iâ€™m committed to understanding the situation before I think I â€œknowâ€ what the answer should be. <br></p>\r\n\r\nMy, but it does get tedious living in a world filled with experts.<br></p>\r\n<center> * * * * *</center>\r\n\r\nP.S.:  You can now add comments to these posts, so please help me along the road in my quest for perfect enlightenment.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

[Added Wednesday AM:  An <a href=''http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/10/technology/10tags.html?''>article in the New York Times</a> today contradicts this headline, stating that Intermec Technologies -- which claims that it owns 145 RFID technology patents and is already in litigation involving some of them -- was not asked to join the new group.]<br/></p>\r\n\r\n The press release tries to put the best face on the announcement that such a large group of patent owners will be charging a fee for the use of readers, and (more significantly) the billions of RFID tags that a mature industry could be expected to purchase per year.  For example, the words "patent pool" are never used in the release (it speaks of the formation of a "patent consortium" instead).  Similarly, the release states in part: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis consortium will be modeled after the successful patent licensing consortium formed and implemented around essential technologies in the MPEG-2 and DVD industries. As with those successful models, the RFID consortium is intended to provide a structured approach for holders of essential RFID patents to receive fair compensation for those patents, at a reasonable cost to the end-user, thus promoting rapid adoption of RFID. This approach offers competitive benefits by integrating complementary technologies and reducing transaction costs. It offers an effective alternative to time-consuming and expensive individual licensing agreements. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIs this all just self-serving spin, following on the failure of EPC Global to achieve a royalty free result?  The answer will depend on whether you look at the world ideologically or pragmatically.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIf you are in the former camp, and especially if you favor the open source model, then this is a great disaster, and the Dark Side has triumphed, because a new technology will be taxed.  But let''s look at the other side for a moment and see if the future is really all that bleak. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nFirst, let''s look at how a patent pool operates, when all owners of relevant patent claims agree to participate.  When that happens, the following results can follow: <ul><li>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants decide on what royalty the market can bear without slowing adoption.  Let''s say that amount is one cent per RFID tag.\r\n\r\n<li> The participants then agree on a formula for dividing that one-cent among them.\r\n\r\n<li> They also agree on one licensing agreement, and appoint one licensing agent to administer the program.  Implementers thus can have "one stop shopping" rather than having to negotiate agreements with multiple vendors.\r\n\r\n<li>  Because there is a single point of licensing, the terms really are RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory), because there are no one-on-one negotiations and private deals between vendors and implementers.\r\n\r\n<li>  When other companies are awarded patents, they simply join the pool, and the royalty that implementers are charged doesn''t go up.  Thus, there are still rewards for continuing innovation, while the price remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n<li>  Because everyone is on the bus, the patent landscape is cleared, and all of the patent owners have an incentive to get behind the effort.  \r\n\r\n<li>  Most significantly, there is less likelihood of a destructive battle between two competing standards, because everyone can get a piece of the action (possibly on different parts of the technology chain, with one company making their profit on tags, and another on readers), even though there is only one standard.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe result, therefore, can be rapid adoption of inexpensive technology, with no threat of a standards war, but with continuing R&D and ongoing upgrading of the initial architecture.  In other words, a new technology can enter the marketplace more quickly, more pervasively, and even more cheaply due to greater volume sales and price competition, and end-users can adopt that new technology with less risk. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOf course, in the best of all possible worlds, patent owners would make their patents available for free to achieve exactly the same result, and content themselves with a vast new market, competing with each other to offer valuable features and superior quality and service. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut we live in a different world, and it''s not likely that we''ll be able to do anything about that in the near future.  Until that happens, maybe a penny a tag for the Guy is a small price to pay to know that you''re buying a VHS video player, and not a Betamax.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

We flew to Denver, and then roamed around Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California, stopping to camp and hike wherever we pleased. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPartway through the trip, we were crossing the panhandle of Idaho, driving across the Sawtooth Mountains, and following the Clearwater River to the Pacific (as Lewis and Clark had done long before, although we didnâ€™t know it at the time).

Of course, we stopped for the night. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe next day, we took a dirt road up into the mountains that the Clearwater divided, coming out eventually above the tree line, and stopped when we reached the ridge top.  Everywhere we looked, the mountains rose and fell into the infinite distance.  Around us,  it was like a Japanese garden: glacier-scoured granite; moss and wild flowers; spectral, wind and snow-sculpted trunks of twisted trees, bleached to a clean, pure white by decades of winter ice and wind following the forest fire that had wiped the mountain tops clean.  That was when it hit me that I could take my pack and walk for a week if I wished, anywhere I wanted to go, each direction as eligible as the next. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI promised myself that I would come back there one day, and thirty years later I did.

Who should be able to decide how it is maintained?  One man''s wilderness may be another man''s folly.', 'John McPhee (one of my favorite authors) once wrote a book called <i>The Control of Nature</i>.  His theme was manâ€™s hubris in attempting to contain the power of nature, and his propensity for forgetting how limited his ability to do so really is.  One of three examples that McPhee describes highlights the heroic nature of the quest, as the inhabitants of a small town on an Icelandic island try and save their homes and harbor by turning fire hoses against the lava flow that is about to overwhelm them.  In another, he demonstrates the foolhardiness of those that build houses in California canyons that periodically are the site of flashfloods that hurl bus-sized boulders through anything that stands in their path. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately (depending on your point of view), nature isnâ€™t always that powerful, and submits with a whimper.  All too often, it can be tamed with a tool as simple as a cow. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThis comes home all to forcefully wherever you travel in the lower forty-eight states, and increasingly so even in Alaska.  Consider the following:  I am currently in what may be the least inhabited part of those forty-eight states.  In an area roughly 160 by 120 miles, there are a total of 12 ranches.  Period.  No towns, not even a crossroads with a gas station, and almost no crossroads, for that matter (and where roads do cross, theyâ€™re both dirt or gravel).  Surely this must be, by some definition wilderness, right? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately (again, depending on your point of new), not in any classic sense, nor even in a consistent sense within this same area.  To the west and east are a few ranches.  In the middle is the 575,000-acre Sheldon Antelope refuge.  And all of the land is intensely managed, stark and beautiful though it may be. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAlthough dry, this land lies at 5 to 8,000 in altitude, and when Charles Freemont traveled through on his journey of (white) discovery the grass grew up to his knees â€“ when he was on horseback.  Now, it is an arid expanse of sagebrush and cheat grass, with juniper at the higher elevations.  Itâ€™s still rich in wildlife (on which more later) in current, if not in historical terms, and it is actually more empty today than it was when the native inhabitants greeted him.  But as with virtually every acre of land west of the Mississippi that doesnâ€™t have crops or houses on it, it has cattle, on a percentage basis.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nImpossible?  Consider this also:  I once wound my way up from the desert to cross a mountain range in eastern Colorado, finally crossing to the other side in a heavily wooded pass at over 10,500 feet.  At the very apex of the pass, after climbing through trees for over 2,000 feet, there wasâ€¦a cattle grate. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIn fact, the very great majority of all of the unfarmed, non urban or suburban land in the entire western half of the country bears only such vegetation as cattle cannot eradicate.  It therefore also means that the American west can only support such types of wildlife, and in such numbers, as can survive on a diet of what cattle wonâ€™t eat (or whatâ€™s left of what they do eat), or on a diet of the animals that can survive on such vegetation.  Even the climate has been altered over the last hundred and fifty years, given the altered evaporative quotient for such a landscape and the higher temperatures that an arid landscape produces. So also has the carrying capacity of the land, as a result of the loss of topsoil through erosion and dust storms, and the reduction of  water tables as â€œfossilâ€ water supplies deposited during the last ice age are tapped more quickly than they are replenished. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nEven where cattle do not graze the land, it is sometimes (as with the Sheldon refuge) managed to maximize the number of â€œdesirableâ€ animals (e.g., antelope and sage hen, for hunting) and minimize the number of â€œundesirableâ€ animals (e.g., wild horses, which are culled annually).  As I hiked through the Sheldon terrain, I could see juniper trees that had been cut so as not to lose the sagebrush that antelope and sage grouse rely upon for cover.  Similarly, even though there are no dwellings to protect, I met a fire crew pre-positioned in the center of the refuge because a thunderstorm was on the way.  Sagebrush takes a long time to recover, once burned.  Without such fire management, the land might eventually revert to its earlier, natural state, of high grass (which retains water and soil). <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo if wilderness means â€œlandscape unaltered by manâ€, then there is about as much wilderness left in the western half of the country as there is virgin forest in the east. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhat of all of the public land?  By far and away the largest amount is owned by the Bureau of Land Management, the Forestry Service, and other government agencies, each of which officially or analogously operates under the slogan â€œLand of Many Usesâ€ (and it is, after all, public land).  Only National Parks, by law, are immune from grazing.  Virtually all of the rest is leased for ranching, mining, and/or logging.  The percentage of National Park land, augmented by any Nature Conservancy, state, local or private land that does not allow grazing, is woefully small. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOf course, let he who is a vegetarian cast the first stone (I can throw a modest stone â€“ I virtually never eat beef).  But even if I donâ€™t eat beef, I still live in a nation of meat eaters, and if we bar all grazing from public lands, it would only mean that we would be despoiling some other countryâ€™s landscape.  All of which leaves us with choices to make, and very difficult ones, when easterners (like me) want to walk in wilderness that others (like the people who actually live here) donâ€™t want to give up their ranches, or let anyone else tell them how to manage them, either. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSadly, like so many things today, it''s turned into a red state/blue state issue, with each successive administrations pushing the laws in the direction it favors, and sometimes reversing the initiatives of it''s predecessor.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Water and nutrients are scarce, so plants are typically at a distance from each other (some even have natural poisons to prevent other plants from establishing themselves within the reach of their roots).  Hence, it is very easy to see each tree (or flower, or shrub) as it stands proud of other distractions.  And without a thick covering of vegetation, rocks and other aspects of the terrain can also command attention.<br/></p>       \r\n\r\nI once designed and built quite a large stained glass window of a Japanese garden when making stained glass was what I was doing for a living.  Before going to work on the design, I spent the better part of a week in the library learning about the aesthetics of Japanese gardens.  Iâ€™ve forgotten most of it now, but recall that there were a limited number of stone shapes, miniature stone pagodas, plants, and sand and stone patterns, each of which had its own symbolism.  Thus, for one wise in the ways of Japanese gardens, deeper meanings could be appreciated when meditating in such a place beyond the mere visual appeal of the garden, which in itself is considerable.  Happily, anyone can appreciate the exquisite beauty of each element of a Japanese garden, as well as the serenity and appeal of the whole, even if they are ignorant of the symbolic meanings that lie behind the design. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nI find the comparison to a Japanese garden to be inescapable wherever I travel in the Southwest.  The landscape is a kaleidoscope of settings of similar charm and beauty not only in the broad sweep, but also in the finest details.  I am camping as I write this at about 7000 feet, in one of the juniper/pinyon pine â€œpygmy forestsâ€ that are common at that altitude.  Each tree stands at a respectful distance from its neighbors, and gnarled, twisted trunks lie on the ground amid outcroppings of volcanic rock, pocked and contorted from erosion, and displaying a perfect camouflage pattern of gray and gray-green lichen patches.  Occasionally, the rocks are electrified with splashes of orange-red fire dot lichens.  Some species of lichens can live for 4,000 years â€“ how old are these? <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nMy campsite is on one of the innumerable sloping lifts, both small and enormous, that comprise the Basin and Range.  This small example terminates in a sheer rock face a half a mile away that is gradually breaking away in great chunks that form a boulder garden below.  The top of the lift is deeply split by fissures for a hundred yards from its edge, and weirdly eroded everywhere, where the weaker elements of the volcanic flow have been dissolved by rain.  <br/></p> \r\n\r\nOn this irregular platform of rock, not only are water and nutrients almost non-existent, but the winds of winter impact with full, unbroken force as well.  In the shallowest depressions and fissures of the sloping rock grow tiny ferns and flowers; in those that are slightly larger, pinyon pines grow to a height of only five or six feet, but each has a trunk ten inches thick or more at the base.  Farther back, where there is some soil, an ancient juniper is a tangle of bleached-white, dead trunks, but still bears a single vividly alive branch, covered with green-blue, berry-like cones, connected to the roots by a narrow remaining band of living bark.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nNighthawks, working overtime, curvet overhead in sharp, jaggy flights as they hunt insects.  They are the terns of arid places.  Nighthawks make a frequent call that is something between a squeak and a beep! (The Audubon guide, trying its best, describes it as peet!  We have no alphabet or pronunciation guide for animal sounds).  Small flocks of pinyon jays play tag, flying from pine top to pine top, keeping in constant touch with their own indescribable call.  Higher up, ravens fly and vultures spiral in the warm updrafts spawned by the dark, volcanic rock. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nPlaces like there are a photographerâ€™s paradise, as are millions of acres of desert, crag, canyon and alpine meadow throughout the Southwest.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nTo me, the deeper meaning of these natural Japanese gardens is, of course, that they are precious, and cry out to be preserved.  If I were a writer of inspirational literature, there would be metaphors aplenty to be found in the determined struggle of these ancient trees and lichens in the face of the mighty forces of nature, and against all odds.

And each time, I have invariably put the book down in my lap, and simply watched and listened as the colors of the setting sun took control of the sky and metamorphosed through infinite changes, the birds flew and called, the breeze faded, the insects hummed and buzzed, the light faded, the planets and then the stars emerged, and finally the moon asserted its cool, white dominance over sky and earth alike.  It is a performance that cannot be equaled by anything else in the world, until the same time the next day. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nOne night, I camped by a small lake in the Sheldon Antelope Range.  Although all was arid and dry, it had been an unusually wet spring, and water was still draining out of the vast highlands into the small handful of streams that remained.  All was dry and brown to within inches of the water of the lake, but at intervals in the shallows were beds of tall, vividly green rushes.  Waterfowl of many types splashed and called across the lake â€“ moor hens, ruddy ducks, willets, yellow eyes, and others too far off to identify as they moved in fleets across the water.  Nighthawks dived and called overhead, the moor hens grunted in the rushes and huge thunderheads rose in the distance, catching the fire of the sunset, far enough away for me to appreciate their towering majesty, but not close enough for me to hear their thunder. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nAnother night, I camped by a tiny stream in a high meadow in one of the scores of mountain ranges that divide the broad valleys of Nevada from North to South like the folds of a rumpled tablecloth.  The stream was barely more than a foot wide at the riffles that separated its pools, which themselves were never broader than  five feet, but the music of moving water in arid terrain has a magnified charm all its own.

At higher elevations, it is a wispy occasional presence, while in the wide valleys between the mountain ranges it predominates, either filling in between the sagebrush, or forming wide homogenous meadows, often commanding all available space as far as the eye can see.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nYesterday, I drove the 118 miles from Battle Mountain south to Austin, which prides itself on being the most isolated town in the lower forty-eight, with 100 miles, more or less, separating it from the closest towns at each of the cardinal points of the compass.  Most of the time, I saw an endless carpet of golden cheatgrass, sweeping up to, and over, the mountains to either side.  From the inside of a car, it looked attractive.  But in fact, cheatgrass sucks the moisture from the soil, wiping out all other species, and forming vast, sterile monocultural deserts where little native wildlife can thrive.  These vast savannahs of dried grass also become a fire hazard that ignites like a match upon any random lighting strike.  Today, I drove through a modest thunderstorm that touched off five fires within sight that spewed huge clouds of opalescent smoke into the sky. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nUp close, cheatgrass is best understood in religious terms.  If you are a Christian, think of hair shirts and the mortification of the flesh.  If you a Shiite, recall self-flagellation to commemorate the martyrdom of Husayn, the first leader of the Shiites.  If you are a Hindu, then cheatgrass is the very personification of Kharma at work, since cheatgrass is an introduced species of little value to livestock, but one that it has taken advantage of the over-grazing of traditional grasses by livestock to take over the range throughout the Southwest. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nCheatgrass does not overtly resemble an infernal invention of the devil, but if there is a Satan, then cheatgrass is certainly an example of his work at its diabolical best.  The design of cheatgrass is disarmingly simple, but its execution is devilish, and inspires the use of words that would certainly bring a smile to the dark lordâ€™s lips. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nTo be more specific, the wheat-like, drooping head of a cheatgrass plant looks not unlike that of many other grasses, and culminates in a number of seeds, each with a fine strand at its end.  If you look more closely, you will see that each seed incorporates a barbed structure.  Of course, so do the seeds of various other plants, for the purpose of attaching themselves to a passing animal (such as you) in order to hitch a ride to a likely place to germinate and perpetuate the species. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nCheatgrass, however, possesses several unique characteristics not displayed by other similar plants, such as the cocklebur.  True, cockleburs seem to have a magnetic attraction to the ears of my cocker spaniel, and seemingly possess a dervish like power to twirl themselves into a cocoon of dog hair.  But while most plant seeds that rely on the hitchhiking strategy also have an affinity for wool socks, they generally travel peacefully and surrender gracefully when detected. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nNot so with cheatgrass.  Cheatgrass should perhaps be classified as a parasite, rather than a plant, since upon contact, its seeds immediately begin burrowing, not unlike a shipworm, in parallel fashion between the inner and the outer layer of a sock, with the exception of an exquisitely sharp and painful tip, which propels itself immediately into the ankle. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nCheatgrass is not only diabolical, but also insidious: if you look at your sock and see a fuzz of cheatgrass seeds, you can be sure that if you pluck out every single one that you can see, that you will have picked out every seed other than the one that is torturing you.  Moreover, it will have taken you ten minutes to remove the decoy seeds, since the only way to remove many seeds (due to the barb) is to remove your shoe and your sock, and then pull the seeds through from the inside. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nEven after you return home, there will be other cheatgrass seeds, not unlike the members of an Al Qaeda terror sleeper cell, that will quietly hide within those same socks.  Even after you have worn them many times, periodically some mysterious signal, perhaps on the evening news, will activate another seed, which will gleefully implant itself in your ankle with religious zeal.  Burning your socks after a trip to the Southwest is not an unreasonable practice, and may perhaps provide you with a certain catharsis, particularly if you are an animist that believes that all living things have souls, and that (hopefully) cheatgrass seeds can feel agony equal to your own as they are consumed by the flames. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nSo it is that cowboy boots have a very serious purpose.  If you donâ€™t happen to own a pair of this manly footwear, then a cheaper alternative is to purchase a pair of gaiters.  Outfitters sell them for cross-country skiing, but the same products will work just as well to foil cheatgrass.  Basically, gaiters are an ankle wrap, with Velcro and/or snaps to attach them around your calf, and a bit of bungee cord that goes under your boot ahead of the heel, to prevent the gaiter from hiking upwards and leaving your ankle defenseless.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nI highly recommend that you purchase a pair of gaiters if you plan to hike in the Southwest and donâ€™t own a pair of cowboy boots.  That is, unless you have ever had anything to do with introducing an invasive, foreign species.  If thatâ€™s the case, youâ€™ve got some serious atonement to do, and cheatgrass should serve that purpose nicely. <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

In some areas, obsidian will predominate, and in others yellow jasper, but most often you will see a beautiful mix of red and yellow jasper, various colors of chalcedony and quartzite, light colored cherts, black obsidian and red petrified wood.  What you are looking at are the remains of prehistoric tool manufacture. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nNative Americans roamed the entire Southwest for at least 12,000 years, and perhaps longer.  They were skillful at utilizing the materials at hand, superbly talented at creating flaked implements, and had a love for using the most attractive materials available in the process.  One assumes that as they roamed throughout the landscape, they not only went out of their way to visit those places where suitable material was abundant, but also kept an eye out at all times for good quality material when it appeared wherever they went. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nThe number of lithic scatters (the name used by archaeologists) in the Southwest is in the many tens of thousands, and perhaps millions.  Similar scatters exist throughout the country, probably in similar numbers.  But only in the Southwest are so many in plain view, because there are so many areas with little or no vegetation, or where plants and trees are separated by areas of bare dirt.  If you know where and how to look, finding such scatters is not difficult. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nThat there are so many such scatters should not be too surprising.  After all, Native Americans had no beasts of burden until the re-introduction of the horse by the Spanish.  Suitable materials for knapping (fabrication by flaking) typically occur as cobbles the size of your fist or larger, and therefore are too heavy to carry in volume in their raw form.  As a result, when a piece of material was found, it would be reduced to much smaller sizes and shapes that could later be turned into atlatl (spear thrower) darts, knives, and (in later times) arrowheads.  This not only allowed the heavy core of a cobble to be left behind (the part that could not be further split in such a way as to yield a useful piece of material) along with other unusable bits and pieces, but also meant that cobbles and pieces of cobbles with fatal flaws could be discarded out of hand when the flaws became apparent as they were reduced to smaller sizes. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nConsider also that at first hundreds, and eventually millions, of individuals roamed North America over a period of at least 120 centuries.  Since all were hunter-gatherers until relatively recent times, this meant that Native Americans rarely stayed in one place for very long, or necessarily returned to exactly the same location in their annual cycle of travel.  Each time a band camped, new tools might be made out of the blanks (called performs) that had been shaped at quarry sites, and old tools would need to be repaired or turned into smaller tools when they broke in their original form.  If you do the math, you can see that the number of places where flakes would have been deposited would be very large indeed.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nI suspect that there was a third factor as well that would have led to even more scatter locations:  call it the â€œknitting effect.â€ <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nMany times you will find only a handful of small flakes on the ground, with nothing else to indicate that anyone had ever been anywhere else in the immediate area.  My supposition is that many who made stone tools worked like those that have knitting as a hobby.  That is, in this case, if a Native American stopped for a rest or chatted with friends, out would come his leather pouch of performs and antler tips (for pressure flaking), and he would create a point or two to help while away the time.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nThe small scatter is one common type of deposit of flakes (or debittage, as rock waste is more properly called).  Often you will find large areas, sometimes many acres in size, where a layer of cobbles has become exposed, perhaps on the bottom of a long-evaporated lakebed.  In these areas, the ground will be covered with large, multicolored pieces of material, most from one to four inches in length.  These are quarry sites, and if you were to look for hours, you would not be likely to find a single completed artifact, because the task at hand was to create pieces of raw material that could be carried away and be turned into any of a variety of tools at a later date.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nAt other times, you may find a mix of large and medium size flakes.  These are reduction flakes: those that were removed from a larger piece to turn it into a preform, or to turn a large perform into a small tool.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nWhere tiny flakes are found, they mark a place where tools were being finished or repaired.  These are pressure flakes, and often indicate the location of a campsite.  While small flakes can be created by percussion (i.e., by striking the nearly completed tool with something more forgiving than stone, such as a billet made out of the base of an elk antler), the final edgework of a tool was more often accomplished by pressing small flakes off the edge of the tool using the tip of an antler.  If you look at a finely created artifact edge-on, you will see a flat zigzag created as a flake was removed from first one side, and then the other.  If you look down on the broad face of the finest and oldest artifacts, you will see that these tiny flake scars form an exquisite pattern that evidences very fine and meticulous work indeed.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nFiguring out where to look for quarry and habitation sites, for me, adds an interesting focus to choosing hiking routes.  But before you become too interested in taking up arrowhead collecting as a hobby, know that almost all of the Southwest is â€œcatch and releaseâ€ territory: itâ€™s illegal to keep artifacts found on any federal land, and the same rule applies in state parks as well.  If you violate the rules, you may be caught (and not released).   <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nSo unless youâ€™re willing to take only pictures of artifacts, and leave them where you found them along with your tracks, itâ€™s best to take up bird watching instead.   <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nWhich, by the way, is also great out here.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The plateau is riddled with horse trails, so I decided to walk down to the spring early the next morning to see if I could find them drinking at the break of day. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nThere are tens of thousands of wild horses in Nevada (not to mention a smaller number of wild burros), the descendants of stock that escaped from Spanish explorers and settlers in the 1600s.  Like antelope and deer, they compete for the grass that cattle eat.  But unlike antelope and deer, they are not game animals, and thus are seen by many as a nuisance that competes with more desirable animals for available forage.  Others, both local and from away, admire their beauty and spirit.  <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nAccording to a guidebook I have with me (but no Internet access â€“ the wilderness does require a few sacrifices), there were about 23,000 wild horses in Nevada in 2001, a number that the BLM has decided is about 5,000 to high.  As a result, the BLM culls the herd from time to time, setting traps around water holes to catch some, and using helicopters to chase others into confined areas where they can be caught. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nUnder this plan, 52,000 horses have been taken since 1971.  Under the management plan, the younger horses are to be put out for adoption, and the older ones sent to refuges in Texas and South Dakota.  However, according to an AP report published in 1997, the BLM had â€œlost trackâ€ of 32,000 wild horses, many or most of which may have been sold to slaughter by pet food companies, confirming the long-standing allegations of animal rights activists (the BLM vigorously denied the claims of the report).  In a court settlement ending a case brought by two such groups following this report, the BLM agreed to clean up its act. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nDespite these efforts to limit their numbers, wild horses are prolific breeders, and hence still a proud part of the Southwestern experience.  But they are also reclusive, and will therefore likely only see them at a distance of a mile or more, grazing on a hillside, unless you make a deliberate effort to see them at closer range. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nMy trip to the spring was not successful, so I continued my walk up country,looking at this and that along the way. Ten minutes later, I heard an abrupt snort, and saw a tall roan with a white blaze on its forehead come to an abrupt halt about 25 yards away, standing at attention between two pinyon pines, and looking straight at me.  After a few moments, it trotted to one side, and then another, stopping at each turn and staring at me as I in turn looked at it, watching without moving.  Each time the stallion turned, it let out a single explosive snort that carried clearly across the distance.  At last, it had had enough of me, turned on its heels, and galloped away in a cloud of dust.  I could feel its hoof beats reverberate through the dry ground as it traveled off, hidden by the trees. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nAfter the hoofbeats died down, I began to walk again, and soon glimpsed a half dozen or so horses though gaps in the trees, trotting parallel to my path.  They stopped and started, their muffled hoof beats floating through the air, just behind a low, forested rise. <br/></p>       \r\n\r\nI walked as quietly and quickly as I could to where I thought the sound of hoofs had last ended, but there was nothing more to be seen. <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

In that piece, I note how simple definitions become powerful legal standards when incorporated into law, and the NYT article provides excellent examples of how the slightest changes in the wording of definitions can have a profound and sweeping impact. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the <i>Times</i> notes that Hoffman suggested adding the word â€œirreversiblyâ€ into the definition of â€œillegal usesâ€.  The result would be that an action in a national park would only be an illegal use if the harm that it might cause were â€œirreversible,â€ which would mean, for example, that clear cutting huge tracts would not automatically be illegal.  Or, as Bill Wade, a former park superintendent and now the executive council director of the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, is quoted as observing, â€œtaken to its extreme, I suppose you could do anything to a wildlife population as long as you preserved the last breeding pair.â€ <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAs noted in my August 20 entry <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1506''>Whose Wilderness is This?</a>, national parks and monuments are the only public lands that are currently off limits for grazing â€“ a use that also arguably causes changes that are not â€œirreversible.â€  If so deemed, it would mean that all public land of every type could now potentially become profoundly altered in this fashion, leaving no land where you and I could see the American wilds in its truly natural form. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThis morning, the <i>Times</i> returned to the topic with its lead editorial, entitled <a href=''http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/opinion/29mon1.html''>Destroying the National Parks</a>.  The <i>Times</i> makes some of the same points that I have been making, saying: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere is no question that we go to national parks to use and enjoy them.  But part of the enjoyment of being in a place like Yosemite or the Grand Canyon is knowing that no matter how much it changes in the natural processes of time, it will continue to exist substantially unchanged....In short, this is not a policy for protecting the parks.  It is a policy for destroying them. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nCould the Grand Canyon ever actually be in danger?  Recall that but for the strenuous efforts of environmentalists (derided by many at the time), the Grand Canyon would be a lake today, held back  by a hydroelectric dam, as was the of Glen Canyon (today, Lake Powell), which the Sierra Club and others were unable to save.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nConsider this as well: another editorial in the <i> Times</i> several weeks ago also reported that an interest group in the West was challenging transactions between land trusts and ranchers, whereby the land trusts would buy the grazing rights from ranchers for less desirable land, which the land trusts would then allow to return to their natural state, and the ranchers could use the proceeds to buy grazing rights to more desirable land.  A win-win?  Apparently not to those that wished to be sure that public land would always be available for grazing. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe article also notes that other changes were proposed that would make it more difficult to create new national parks, or for park officials to seek aid from the EPA to mitigate pollution sources external to parks that have an impact on air or water quality within parks. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAnd, the article notes, the suggested changes would also remove â€œvirtually every reference to the theory of evolution.â€ <br/></p>\r\n\r\n16 senior park service employees met to discuss the suggested changes, and voted to reject them entirely, although they indicated that they would embark upon recommending their own, less radical revisions to the policy document.  A spokesman for the group said that Hoffman (who is senior to those in the review group) was very comfortable with their wishing to start with a clean slate, and characterized his suggested changes as representing a devilâ€™s advocate challenge to current policy. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe reason I find this article to be an apt final chapter to this series is that it illustrates perfectly the tension that exists between two philosophies regarding how national parks in particular, and wilderness areas in general, should be managed, as well as how that tension is manifested in the governmental system. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe group that rejected the suggested changes is defending the position that National Parks should be not only places to enjoy nature, but also as places that represent safe havens for nature, so that the natural world can be enjoyed in as pristine a condition as possible.  Hoffman, on the other hand, is promoting the view that parks should be about access and enjoyment, such as wintertime snowmobiling, which is currently limited in Yellowstone to 760 vehicles a day, in order to limit noise and pollution. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWho is â€œrightâ€ and who is â€œwrongâ€?  It may be that those are not the most useful words to use in asking the question. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nFor example, if you define a national park to be a wilderness area, and define wilderness to be something that has been allowed to revert to, and be maintained in, its pre-1492 condition, then national park policy would be to allow foot access only.  Period.  But if you include making national parks accessible to all (including those with disabilities, as would naturally follow), then you are automatically deciding that you will permit some number of roads, parking areas, sanitary facilities, and so on.  And if you then add education and interpretation to the mission of the national park system, then guides, interpretive displays, nature trails, and so on naturally follow as well. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo the issue once again revolves around definitions, the question of what should go into the definition, and then what types of uses and policies those uses suggest.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIn principle, there is nothing wrong with testing existing definitions periodically to determine whether they reflect current scientific thought, other laws (such as the Americans With Disabilities Act) and other dynamic factors.  The danger comes when those tests are dictated by agendas that would go beyond that purpose, something of which advocacy groups on each side of this question have been guilty.  (An editorial in Fridayâ€™s issue of the <i>Times </i> also notes that the administration is commissioning a <i>fourth</i> study of the impact of snowmobiling in national parks.  Last week''s <i>Times</i> editorial voices the opinion that the administration keeps changing the test parameters each time, hoping that the next time the findings will support its desired outcome.) Today''s editorial goes much farther in assigning a political agenda to the proposed policy changes. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would not wish to see the current policy change, and I would like to see the existing wilderness policy tightened to exclude grazing.  And while I hold that position strongly, I must acknowledge that it''s a viewpoint, and not something that I can contend is manifestly â€œrightâ€, as it presupposes what the goals of national parks should be.  Still, one must wonder why Hoffman thinks that it is necessary to change park policy to explicitly permit the sale of religious items.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nI will close with what I think is an interesting suggestion. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPublic lands logically are subject to some type of balancing of views and interests.  But private lands are not.  Already, there are millions of acres that are owned outright, or controlled through easements, by â€œblue stateâ€ philosophy conservation organizations, such as the Nature Conservancy.  Each property has its own management plan, which can range from liberal public access, to no public access at all, depending upon the nature of the site and the reason that it was conserved (e.g., scenic beauty as compared to endangered species habitat), and even local views of public access and the like (Iâ€™m speaking from personal experience, having been on the board of such an organization for over ten years). <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhich suggests the following:  Why cannot there be â€œred stateâ€ organizations that buy land and subject it to such restrictions â€“ and such liberal use rules â€“ as they may choose (such as hunting, unlimited snowmobiling, use of all terrain vehicles (ATVs) and so on).  As I recall, Ted Turner has already set aside millions of acres of his own land in this fashion expressly for the purpose of preserving the character of ranchlands, providing an existing example of such an effort.  There could also be federal funds available, as there already are at the state level in many states, to assist both types of organizations in purchasing land for their respective purposes. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe results should be â€œwin/winâ€ on all sides, as there would then be three flavors of conserved land, and presumably a higher total acreage under permanent protection from development: heavy (â€œredâ€) use, medium (â€œpublicâ€) use, and site-specific (â€œblueâ€) variable use.  In effect, not unlike the traditional range of K through 12 schools, which range from Waldorf Schools to public schools to military academies, and where public funding is now available for charter schools as well.  Hopefully, it would also take some of the tension out of the debate over how to manage national parks, since there could soon be (for example) numerous tracts of conserved land that would permit liberal use of snow mobile. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWe shall see.  In the meantime, Iâ€™ll look forward to my next wilderness vacation. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nUntil then, this blog returns to standards topics.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

This one comes from the National Science Foundation, would cost $300 million (not yet obtained), and would â€œfocus on security, â€˜pervasive computingâ€™ environments populated by mobile, wireless and sensor networks, control of critical infrastructure and the ability to handle new services that can be used by millions of people.â€ <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAll of which sound like good and necessary goals.  But there are other initiatives in operation as well (the article mentions Internet2, LambdaRail and PlanetLab, or example), each with its own goals. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe existence of so many initiatives raises important questions, such as: Who will decide which ones happen?  Who should be entitled to have a say?  What are the criteria for making those decisions? Who will resolve any architectural conflicts?  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA simple answer to these questions would be â€œWhy is this different from any other set of standards that someone chooses to create, and the market decides whether or not to adopt?â€  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThere are at least a few ways in which it is different.  The first time around, these issues simply did not exist.  But now, the Internet is heavily used and the world is increasingly dependent upon it â€“ itâ€™s become more like a utility than a commercial product or service, more akin to a telecommunications service (which, of course, in many ways it is).  And telecommunications services have for many years been regulated by governments, in part because of their importance to society. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSecond, the United Nations has already identified the Internet as a global resource as part of the WSIS initiative.  Similarly, the venerable International Telecommunication Union, the global, government-participation arbiter of telecommunications that missed out on the party when the Internet got off the ground, is interested in asserting its influence.  Itâ€™s not likely that this trend will end here. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThird, while there is plenty of precedent for standards organizations working things out among themselves when compatibility and similar issues arise, society and governments may not be content to leave this task to such organizations. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nHistorically, in situations like these, government tends to step in, for better or worse.  Will it happen here? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nMy guess is that itâ€™s not a case of if, but when.

That post was titled  <a href='' http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html''>Ontology is Overrated: Categories, Links, and Tags''</a>, and I linked to it yesterday.  Shirky takes the position that a Semantic Web is a throwback to archaic efforts to force the world into hierarchical organizational schema that become out of date almost immediately.  Not only is this too rigid to work, he thinks, but it misses the point: the world is what we think it is, and we should try and suss the collective consciousness, not insist on forcing that consciousness into neat little categorical boxes.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nAs Shirky elegantly asks, â€œDoes the world make sense or do we make sense of the world?â€  If the former is true, then ontology can be a great approach.  But if the latter is the case (as it is), then we need a more free-form approach that allows each of us to understand the world in our own way, and be able to share information, despite the differences.  Itâ€™s a lovely piece of writing.  Well worth reading whether you ultimately come out the same way from an architectural point of view or not.\r\n\r\nThe right wing is presented in an <a href=''http://www.sapinfo.net/index.php4?ACTION=noframe&url=http://www.sapinfo.net/public/en/index.php4/article/Article-6243430d59dac8cdd/en/articleStatistic''> interview</a>  by <i>SAP Info </i>with Andreas Blumauer, a project manager at the Semantic Web School in Vienna, called<i >A Beautiful, Networked World?</i>  Blumauer takes a more strait-laced approach (both as to style and example), countering the Shirky view with statements like this:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nHuman beings store knowledge and experience as images and as networks of terms (generic terms and subordinate terms) or associated topics that can then be woven into complex concepts. And human beings remember rules like "dogs eat meat but not fruit.â€ This rule applies to all dogs and does not need to be stored extra for each breed of dog. Through the creation and externalization of knowledge networks or ontologies that have developed in this manner, a computer "learnsâ€ more about the world and the terms that occur in it. It thus limits the search and delivers precise results.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nShirky would point out that by another ontology, coyotes are dogs â€“ and they do eat fruit (as did my cocker spaniel, for that matter) proving that working by strict rules is a risky business.  Shirkyâ€™s own examples included â€œDresden is a city in East Germanyâ€ â€“ as in, â€œnot any moreâ€.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nFinally, the middle of the road is taken by Jeff Pollock, of Cerebra, in a post called <a href=''http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=11784_0_5_0_C''>Itâ€™s not Google; or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Semantic Web</a>  He debunks what he regards to be some common myths about the Semantic Web, and ultimately resolves the question by taking people out of the equation entirely.  After asking the question whether Google thinks that it can solve all search problems by â€œclever indexing,â€ he concludes:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot me. I donâ€™t worry about it anymore. Google can keep on improving on the ways that <i>people find </i>data. Meanwhile, I will continue to use Semantic Web technology to help automate how <i>machines query </i>data. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf you havenâ€™t tackled the Semantic Web yet, these three pieces make for a nice quick entry not only to the concept and mechanism, but to the controversy as well.', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Well, that depends on your audience, doesn''t it?', 'Todayâ€™s stories that are directly and tangentially related to standards include two that at first blush have nothing in common, but when taken together make an interesting point about how standards fit into the concentric spheres of the world around us. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nTo anyone whoâ€™s likely to be reading this blog entry, standards are something that you probably think of as tools to achieve specific technical objectives (if you are an engineer), or as required specification elements (if you are an end user making a purchase) or perhaps as strategic plan components (if you are a vendor).  But there is another sphere of observers that from time to time pays close attention to standards, and that is the one that is made up of securities investors, analysts, and speculators.  To them, standards are not of importance in and of themselves, but they are important to the extent that they have the potential to positively or negatively impact the price of a given stock. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nEnough investors have become sufficiently aware of the power of standards in this regard that Iâ€™m on an experts list of a service that finds answers for stock analysts, some of whom appreciate that the outcomes of standards-based litigation and the likely winner in a face-off between competing standards initiatives can move stocks, sometimes significantly.  The two stories that weâ€™ll take a look at today involve such situations. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe first story involves the very recent proposal announced by Michael Quinn, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts CTO, to permit State agencies to use only approved open formats to save documents (Quinn''s proposal concludes that only OpenDoc and pdf files would meet this test at this time).  The comment period on the proposal ends tomorrow, and the policy will then move towards mandatory implementation.  You can find several past articles on this story, and will find future articles as they come out, at the <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=5''>Open Source category page </a> of our News Portal. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nEach of the past stories takes an interesting and genuine tack, looking at the policy itself, or the motivation behind the proposal, or the unique needs of governments that are reflected in the policy.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut the first story that I want to point out tonight is one that appeared at The Motley Foolâ€™s site, fool.com.  In that story, called <a href=''http://www.fool.com/News/mft/2005/mft05090816.htm''>Microsoftâ€™s New England Nemesis</a>.  The analysis in this article, after a cursory explanation of whatâ€™s going on, goes as follows:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nFor Microsoft, this could certainly be an annoyance, but it''s hardly a deathblow. If media reports are any indication, Massachusetts has an annual IT budget of about $100 million, of which a "substantial portion" is spent on software. Even if we assume that a quarter of this "substantial portion" is spent on Microsoft products (and that''s highly unlikely, anyway), it would amount to only $25 million -- less than 0.1% of Microsoft''s fiscal 2005 revenues of $39.8 billion.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, now we know why this open source stuff really matters (or doesnâ€™t, as the case may be).  The article goes on to confuse open source and open standards.  If you want to know the real story about the OpenDoc/Microsoft/Massachusetts interplay, as well as link to all of the important pieces, take a look at the insightful analysis at <a href=''http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2005/09/massachusetts_m.html''>Steve Wallisâ€™s blog</a>.  Until not so long ago, Steve was an open source evangelist inside Microsoft (no, thatâ€™s not quite an oxymoron), so he has a unique perspective on this story. <br/></p>\r\n \r\nThe <a href=''http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/12593186.htm''>second story</a> I want to note is but the latest installment in the endless Rambus soap opera (run a search at this site on â€œRambusâ€ and youâ€™ll see what I mean by endless).  To cut to the chase, Rambus is a licensing company, a â€œpatent farm,â€ as some would call it, that develops but does not commercialize technology.  Instead, it licenses its patented technologies to memory manufacturers.  Nothing wrong with that, as such (after all, MIT and many other universities do the same thing, albeit with different motivations and far gentler economics).  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a Virginia jury decided that along the way Rambus also gamed a standard setting process in the early 1990s in order to reap the very significant (as in â€œbillions of dollarsâ€) benefits of its submarine patents, and then destroyed documents to cover its conduct up when some refused to pay up and litigation followed (and still continues today).  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe result is that Rambus is the darling of stock speculators, since it is infinitely volatile, depending upon the latest developments in its various lawsuits over the years with Infineon, Micron, the FTC, Samsung, and others.  Stay ahead of herd, and you can cash in on the bumps and the bounces.  And when thereâ€™s nothing happening in court, thereâ€™s nothing after a long value slide like a good rumor to make for some quick buy/sell opportunities, such as todayâ€™s rumor that Rambus might be acquired.  As Mike Cohen, an analyst at Pacific American Securities (and a holder of Rambus stock) noted in TheStreet.com today in <a href=''http://www.thestreet.com/_googlen/tech/semis/10241690.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA''>another article</a> on the same rumor, Rambus stock is "worth either $5 or $90," based on whether you think that Rambus will eventually come out on top or with the short end of the litigation stick.  Either way, itâ€™s quite a poker chip, if you bet smart.  Who cares what the ultimate outcome is?  Thatâ€™s what puts are for. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nStill, even some day traders forget that itâ€™s all about the moola, and start drinking their portfolio company''s Kool-aid.  Does that make them better or worse?   My writing in the past on this subject, as well as the pro bono briefs that Iâ€™ve written and filed with the Supreme Court and the FTC, are part of the mix of data that the market absorbs, leading me to have a certain negative appeal to the penny stock speculators that are True Believers in the infinite righteousness of Rambus.  Take a look at <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/blog.php?ID=16''>RMBS and (Another) Dark Side of the Internet</a> and see what you think.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo whatâ€™s the point (or points)?  I suppose that, for better or worse, standards mean different things to different people.  They can be vital enablers to some, strategic weapons to others, and just another poker chip to others who donâ€™t know or care what standards even are.  Is this a great country, or what? (You decide.) <br/></p>\r\n\r\nNot to reveal my own biases, of course, but as I read these two articles, I couldnâ€™t help recalling one of the many cleverly handled visual clichÃ©s in the 1980 movie spoof <i>Airport</i>.  In that scene, the crisis that is the focus of the movie takes long enough to play out in mid-air that it captures the attention of the entire country, to the exclusion of all else.  In time-honored fashion (assuming that you watch a lot of old movies), the camera cuts to spinning newspaper after spinning newspaper, each of which slows in turn to reveal itâ€™s take on the lead story of the day story.  The <i>Times</i> headline tells the story of the airborne drama in staid fashion, while <i>Varietyâ€™s</i> headline about the same story is smarmy and alliterative, and so on.  <br/><p>\r\n\r\nBut the last one makes my point best.  That paper is a supermarket check-out counter tabloid that, when it eventually comes to rest, holds a huge headline announcing its own lead story of the day:<br/><p>\r\n\r\n<center><B>BOY TRAPPED IN REFRIGERATOR EATS OWN FOOT</B></center>\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The eyes of all people are upon us.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nPuritan divine John Winthrop famously uttered those words (based on a scriptural passage in the Gospel of Matthew) in a sermon in Boston in 1630.  He also included them in a work entitled â€œOn Christian Charity.â€  His famous phrase has been transplanted into various settings, and employed for many purposes, ever since (Ronald Reagan was particularly prone to quote Winthrop to illustrate his own vision of the mission of America). <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to recall Winthropâ€™s cautionary words yet again in the context of the decision by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to require use of the Open Document format internally (and therefore mandating compliance by a variety of external partners as well).  While Massachusetts is not the first government to embrace the Open Document format, it is the first jurisdiction in the United States to take the plunge. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThere are more than superficial resemblances between calling for right conduct in public and right conduct in information technology.  Making IT transitions is always, to state it frankly, a pain in the neck.  One that is necessary on a frequent basis, to be sure, but what CIO enjoys procuring, installing, learning (and worst of all) training in connection with deploying a new IT resource?  Governments, therefore, can play a key role in getting a marketplace over the hump of adopting new technology, especially where businesses are not sufficiently motivated to do so for their own reasons. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIn the case of Massachusetts, there is something of the flavor of John Winthropâ€™s messianic quest as well.  The Commonwealth, after all, was one of the most spirited states in pursuing antitrust charges against Microsoft not so long ago, and one of the most unwilling to fold its tents after the Department of Justice opted to settle.  By challenging Microsoftâ€™s claim that it cannot adopt the Open Document format without causing legacy issues with older versions of Microsoft products, Peter Quinn, the Massachusetts CIO, and his department are doubtless continuing the pursuit of warfare by other means as well as making important IT decisions. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut is it over-reaching to recall Winthrop in such a context?  Perhaps not, given the fervor of the open source community.  True, the Open Document format is a standard, not an open source software product.  But it has been instantiated in the OpenOffice and other open source office suites, and the uptake of those software tools will doubtless receive a solid push from the decision of Massachusetts, and the goal - independence from proprietary lock-in - is the same in each case. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIs that enough to invoke a comparison between Peter Quinn and John Winthrop?  Perhaps it is.  Consider the following press release from Open Source Victoria (as in Victoria, Australia), titled, <a href=''http://www.linuxpr.com/releases/8128.html''>OVA to States:  Follow Massachusetts in Open Document Standards</a>  (the states being referred to, incidentally, are those Down Under, and not in North America).  In part, the press release reads as follows:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts has announced the adoption of the OpenDocument XML file format as its preferred method for storing government documents. In doing so, Massachusetts joins the Australian Federal Government in adopting this format for long-term electronic document storage. Open Source Victoria calls on all remaining Australian states and government agencies to also adopt this format, as it is the only viable approach to ensuring guaranteed access to public sector documents and data in perpetuity. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nJohn Winthrop would hardly know what to make of software, but doubtless he would be pleased to see that a decision taken on Beacon Hill can still cast a light that provides inspiration around the world. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Watch for the September issue of the Consortium Standards Bulletin, which will focus on the uptake of open source by governments, and will include a story on the Massachusetts decision, based on interviews with Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn, the OASIS Open Document TC chair, and Microsoft representatives.

In August, humans landed on the moon. </p>\r\n\r\n2.  Summer saw the invention of UNIX. </p>\r\n\r\n3.  In the autumn, those first four nodes of the ARPAnet went up. </p>\r\n\r\n4.

The issue, which focused on the Massachusetts decision to mandate archiving using the OpenDocument Format, was a bear to write, requiring many interviews and much research.  Due to the continuing unfolding of events, I also had to delay finalizing and sending it for a week.  As a matter of fact, events are continuing to unfold.  Iâ€™ll cover these at the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/''>News Portal</a>, where Iâ€™ll set up a subtopic that will aggregate Massachusetts OpenDocument news stories, and Iâ€™ll also write about these ongoing development in this blog.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut there have been some other big news stories this week that I have neglected, and one of them relates to the ongoing discussions in the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) commissioned under the UN sponsored World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).  The WSIS process began includes holding several preparatory meetings intended to set the stage for the second WSIS global meeting, which will be held in Tunis, Tunisia, in November of this year.  The latest and last of these meetings was held in Geneva from the 19th to the 30th of this month, and is reported to have been quite a roller coaster.  You can read about earlier events by clicking on the â€œWSIS/Internet Governanceâ€ subcategory archival links on the left-hand side of this blog page and of the News Portal page. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, on to this weekâ€™s news from the WGIG meeting. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have been following this story over the long term, you will recall that the last news was that the WGIG had succeeded in coming up with ...<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1403''>four proposals</a>, due to inability to achieve consensus around any single proposal.  Not surprisingly, this laid the foundation for contention the next time those involved convened, since agreement on a single proposal is needed prior to the Tunis meeting in order for the effort to prove fruitful. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAnd contentious it was.  Much to the shock of the US, the EU decided towards the end of the meeting to break ranks with the US, and presented a <a href='' www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/pc3/contributions/sca/EU-28.doc''>surprise proposal</a> that would subject aspects of the Internet to a new global body.  Until now, the EU had been supporting the US, which has been taking a firm stand on retaining supervision over ICANN.  Third world countries have been lobbying for a more neutral form of governance. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe UK/EU proposal includes a set of â€œguiding principlesâ€ for any action to be taken.  They are mainly (the first and last especially) reassuring (from a technical standpoint):  <blockquote>\r\n\r\n-  it should not replace existing mechanisms or institutions, but should build on the existing structures of Internet Governance, with a special emphasis on the complementarity between all the actors involved in this process, including governments, the private sector, civil society and international organisations each of them in its field of competence; <br/>\r\n-  this new public-private co-operation model should contribute to the sustainable stability and robustness of the Internet by addressing appropriately public policy issues related to key elements of Internet Governance; <br/>\r\n-the role of governments in the new cooperation model should be mainly focused on principle issues of public policy, excluding any involvement in the day-to-day operations; <br/>\r\n-the importance of respecting the architectural principles of the Internet, including the interoperability, openness and the end-to-end principle.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe proposal then outlines the following Essential Tasks to be performed:<blockquote>\r\n\r\na.  Provision for a global allocation system of IP number blocks, which is equitable and efficient; <br/>\r\nb.  Procedures for changing the root zone file, specifically for the insertion of new top level domains in the root system and changes of ccTLD managers; <br/>\r\nc.  Establishment of contingency plans to ensure the continuity of crucial DNS functions; <br/>\r\nd.  Establishment of an arbitration and dispute resolution mechanism based on international law in case of disputes; <br/>\r\ne.  Rules applicable to DNS system. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nFinally, the proposal calls for the creation of a new Forum for the purpose of accomplishing the listed tasks.  However, it suggests that the Forum should exist for a â€œpredefined periodâ€ rather than have a perpetual charter, and also that, â€œIt should work with existing institutions or organisations and not try to dominate issues already dealt with elsewhere. It should not perform oversight tasks.â€ <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAn official <a href='' http://www.itu.int/wsis/newsroom/press_releases/wsis/2005/30sep.html'' >press release</a> was released yesterday that covers all of the topics covered at the preparatory meeting.  The section of the press release that relates to Internet Governance reads as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>Breakthrough on Internet governance </b><br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe PrepCom-3 Internet governance debate centered around the report of the multi-stakeholder Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) set up following the Geneva Phase of WSIS to investigate and make proposals on the future governance of the Internet. The groupâ€™s final report released in Geneva on 18 July, along with comments on the report by all stakeholders, served as a source of inspiration for discussions over the two-week period. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAfter a slow start characterized by strongly polarized positions, the pace picked up substantially in Week 2 following the release of a draft document by the Chair, which saw delegates knuckle down to the task of brokering agreement and drafting new text on issues ranging from spam and cybercrime to interconnection costs and â€” most crucially â€” management of critical Internet resources such as the domain name and IP addressing systems. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhile many delegations from the developing world had been vocal on the urgent need for new management and oversight mechanisms to better reflect the global nature of the Internet, others, led by the US, had presented a relatively united front generally supportive of the status quo. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThat scenario changed, however, two days before the end of PrepCom, when the UK delegation, speaking on behalf of the European Union, tabled a new proposal that marked a clear departure from its earlier position.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal outlined a new framework for international cooperation that would see the creation of a new, multi-stakeholder forum to develop public policy, and â€” most significantly â€” international government involvement in allocation of IP addressing blocks and procedures for changing the root zone file to provide for insertion of new top-level domain names and changes of country-code top level domain name (ccTLDs) managers. <br/></p>\r\nOther countries added their suggestions, and with eight proposals now tabled, informal consultations will continue to be held from now until the back-to-back meeting in Tunis. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere have been many short articles written on this week''s events (one of which I''ve posted at the Standards News Portal), as well as some more detailed summaries, <a href=''http://www.worldsummit2005.de/en/web/796.htm''>one of which</a> was posted in English by the German <a href=''http://www.boell.de/asp/frameset_en.html''>Heinrich-Boll Foundation</a>, and provides a good sense of the horse trading thatâ€™s been going on in Geneva, as well as detail on a Canadian proposal.  <a href=''http://www.worldsummit2005.de/en/web/797.htm''>Another writeup</a> at the same site posted the following day provides perspective on how the meetings ended "in disarray," and what is likely to happen next.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n Watch the WGIG <a href=''www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/pc3/working/dt14rev1.doc''>Compilation of Comments</a> page and the ConsortiumInfo.org Standards News Portal page for further details as they become available. <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

I had thought so when I wrote the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>Feature Article</a> for the September issue of the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a>.  Among other things, Mike Pryke-Smith, Microsoft Office marketing manager, had been <a href=''http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=B768CE5D-740F-405E-ABE5-6A377EA8C5D7''>quoted</a> in June stating that Microsoft would not open its formats up to a standards body, citing backwards compatibility issues as a reason for wanting to keep formats under its control. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut apparently there is some flexibility on OpenDocument, and in truth Pryke-Smith made this point last June in the same Computer Business News Online article just mentioned, which includes the following: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nPryke-Smith said Microsoft would not be adopting OpenDocument, citing backwards compatibility concerns, but did say the company will watch to see how adoption of the standard develops. "We''ll respond to customer demand on that," he said. "Our main focus is serving our existing customer base." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nOf course, that article was written when Microsoft was still expecting its XML Reference Schema to be acceptable to Massachusetts, so it was an easy remark to make when there was no immediate crisis on the horizon. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut how about now?  If Microsoft wanted to intimidate others from following Massachusetts'' lead, one might expect that it would now be saying, "no way, never."  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut no. It seems that "wait and see" is still Microsoft''s stated policy, meaning that it is keeping a back door open to the possibility of supporting OpenDocument in the future.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhere do I get that?  Nick Tsilas, a Senior Attorney at Microsoft I know, corrected me on this, emailing me about ten days ago as follows:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAndy, this is not accurate.  I think what we have said is that features are dictated by customer demand and, until the Massachusetts-related activity occurred, Open Document was not even on our radar screens. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI later got back to Nick, and asked him whether he could confirm that this is current Microsoft policy.  In an email on which he copied Microsoft General Manager of Information Worker Business Strategy Alan Yates(I had earlier interviewed Alan in connection with the article), Nick replied: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes-- I can confirm that the [above] is the company position.  For us this has been, and will continue to be a matter of evaluating the flow of customer requirements, and this is a new issue.  For example, while the timing may be suspect to some, our pdf development was the result of evaluating customer requirements.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo there is no line drawn in the sand, nor (to put it another way) has Microsoft painted itself into a corner.  If OpenDocument picks up steam, a back door for support is ajar.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nHow far?  That I don''t know.  But Sun, IBM, and others are certainly keeping the heat on on Microsoft, trying to help the OpenDocument train gather momentum.

The feature article was called <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>Massachusetts and OpenDocument:  A Brave New World?</a>, and was based on detailed interviews with all of the main players in this ongoing saga.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nDavid Berlind, over at ZDNet, in his <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/''>Between the Lines</a> blog with Dan Farber, has also been covering this story, and has just posted an <a href=''http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5893208.html''>exhaustive piece</a>, based on extensive interviews with many of those involved.  The piece is so long (c. 9,000 words) that I''ve only had time to give it a fast read, but there''s all kinds of good data in there that deserves the type of  thorough read that I hope to give it tomorrow after a good night''s sleep.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nTrue, some of the prose is a bit over the top (the piece begins, "Warning. If you read any further, you will find yourself at ground 0.0 of the biggest battle the computer industry has ever seen."  Ahem.  Yes, indeed), but certainly this is in fact a real donnybrook that will be a good watch for many months yet to come.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nSince we are already in that phase of history where those involved (losers especially) try to recreate what has just happened to reflect best on their own roles, it should be useful for me to provide detail on what the same people were saying *before* Massachusetts announced its final decision, so here we go. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIn this entry, I''ll talk about two things:  whether Microsoft was justified in feeling surprised by the Massachusetts decision, and second, what was really going on with the Sun announcement on ODF patents. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nTo set the stage:  My interviews occurred on and between September 20 and 26 (with most occurring before the Massachusetts decision was announced the night of September 23) , and included Alan Yates and Nick Tsilas (MS), Michael Brauer(Sun), Peter Quinn (MA), Patrick Gannon, Mary McCrae and Carol Geyer (OASIS),and Jonathan Zuck and Morgan Reed of the Association for Competitive Technology (who opposed the Massachusetts proposal), among others. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<b>I.  Genuine Surprise, or Public Posture? <br/></p></b>\r\n\r\nOne question that I asked many of those that I talked to was whether Microsoft should be surprised if Massachusetts rejected the MS XML Reference Schema.  I also asked everyone whether it would in fact be difficult or impossible for Microsoft to support OpenDocument without running into backward compatibility issues.  With the exception of Alan Yates, everyone to whom I posed these questions said that Microsoft should not be surprised and that backward compatibility issues did not appear to be significant, based on everything they knew.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPeter Quinn (who I interviewed the day before the formal announcement) said that while he obviously couldn''t speak for Microsoft, he thought that Massachusetts had been sufficiently clear that the final decision should be no surprise, and that he had heard nothing during the final comment period that would justify a reversal in the Commonwealth''s position. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhen I posed the same question to Alan Yates, his response was to the effect that he simply couldn''t believe that Massachusetts would make a decision that he believed to be so wrong headed. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo was this a public stance, or an honest representation? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI won''t pretend to say that I know the answer to that question, and David goes into this much more thoroughly than I had occasion to do in any event.  I think that it is fair to say, however, that if Microsoft did sincerely believe that Massachusetts would not make the decision that it did, that it was blinding itself from taking in data that others were able to process more accurately. So it would appear that if Alan''s expressions of surprise were sincere, that Microsoft''s belief in the virtue of it''s position and technology prevented it from appreciating that Peter Quinn and Secretary Kriss might actually value other criteria sufficiently highly to lead them to a different balancing of  values.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n<b>II.  The Sun Licensing Announcement <br/></p></b>\r\n\r\nWhile I learned confidentially during my interviews that Sun intended to clarify it''s position on any patents that it owned that might be infringed by an implementation of OpenDocument, I was unfortunately not at liberty to disclose that at the time my issue was released (the Sun announcement was made at approximately the same time my issue was finalized).  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe question of whether there were "openness" problems with OpenDocument, however, had been raised in my interviews with Microsoft, and I had therefore inquired into it in many of my interviews.  In David''s piece, he wonders whether there was a conspiracy on this point.  In fact, I specifically asked Peter Quinn if he was aware of any problems with any Sun patents, and his reply was that he was unaware of any such issue.  He also stated that no one had raised that as an objection or an issue.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nTurning to the mechanics of the Sun announcement, I do need to clarify one point from David''s story:  the Sun announcement that it "would not assert" it''s patents against OpenDocument adopters is not as radical as David thinks, when he states: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat made Sun''s idea of a non-assertion covenant unique is that it''s the sort of covenant that mentions no patents in particular, but that gives developers carte blanche access to any of the issuer''s patents they need to implement a particular specification without having to agree to or sign a license. Thus, it''s sort of a license-less license.  \r\n\r\nThe idea is so progressive that some believe it could be more than just a next step towards non-proliferation of open source licenses (in other words, if no licenses are required, there''s nothing to proliferate), but also the next step towards a different attitude when it comes to the software patent issues that currently plague the industry.  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhile the exact wording of the non-assertion pledge might have taken time to niggle out, the concept is neither new nor novel (I''ve used it myself in a number of standard setting organization intellectual property policies over the years).  To give Sun credit, many patent attorneys believe that there are subtle weaknesses in a non-assertion covenant, when compared to a license, that prevent most of them from finding the alternative broadly acceptable.  Sun has a more open attitude towards this approach than any other major corporation that I''ve negotiated with, and Jonathan Nimer, a Sun attorney that works with standard setting organizations, has advocated its use previously in a number of organizations with which he and I have been involved.<br/></p>\r\n \r\nThat''s it for now.  I look forward to giving David''s post a much more thorough read tomorrow, and will try and fit in some more data and observations in the midst of a weekend trip to New York, time and opportunity providing.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

A third, formed outside the IEEE, that says "take our proposal instead, or we''ll go it alone."', 'How much is the 802.11 family of IEEE standards worth?  Well, let''s assume that it''s conservatively worth many billions of dollars in chips, routers, and services.  To paraphrase Thomas Hobbes, tell a vendor that it may miss out on that type of money and it focuses the mind wonderfully.  It can also lead it to adopt impressively hardball standards strategies as well. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it is that we learned this last week that a long building log jam in the IEEE working group that is developing the 100 Mbit/sec+ WLAN standard had broken.  But not through a compromise between WWiSE and TGn Sync, the two rival groups that have been facing off for months, although companies like Broadcom had forecast just such a resolution as recently as  <a href=''http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=171202547''>October 3</a>.  Instead, there was an announcement only a few days later of a new group of two dozen companies (including guess who -- Broadcom) called the <a href=''http://www.enhancedwirelessconsortium.org/home''>Enhanced Wireless Consortium</a>.  The new group includes many other heavyweights, such as Cisco, Intel, and Aptheros, but pointedly excludes Airgo Networks, Inc., a leading chip vendor. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nTrue, IEEE is a tough organization to get a standard out of: a 75% vote of the working group is needed to support the winning proposal.  In this case, neither of the lead groups (or a third proposal, championed by Motorola) succeeded in carrying the day.  The next step was to be the creation of a joint proposal by representatives of both contenders, that both would agree to support.  Instead, a group of IEEE members that tend towards the PC and silicon end of the membership launched the EWC initiative instead.  Predictably, each side</a> has uncomplimentary things to say about the other''s motives and specification. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally, this pursuit of standards by other means will result in a finally adopted 802.11n standards, to be maintained by the IEEE.  But according to an article in <a href=''http://www.techworld.com/mobility/features/index.cfm?FeatureID=1856''>TechWorld</a>, some EWC members are indicating that they will promote their specification whether the IEEE adopts it or not. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story seems significant to me for two reasons that transcend the question of how soon you or I will be able to enjoy reliable, certified WLAN services, and whether my next laptop supports two standards rather than just one.  The first reason is that this type of behavior is becoming more common.  Think, for example, of the formation of a <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1472''>patent pool</a> within EPCGlobal (but excluding IPR heavyweight <a href='' http://www.intermec.com/eprise/main/Intermec/Content/home''>Intermec Technologies</a>), which is interested in reaping royalties from its own patents, or the multi-year fight to the death between the Blu-ray Group and the HD-DVD camp over the next generation DVD video format, or the ongoing RFID dispute between China and the rest of the world in the same standards area. None of this augers well for the rapid development and adoption of quality standards.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second reason I find this behavior disquieting is because standards are all about consensus.  If people decide to opt out of well-respected standard processes such as those conducted by the IEEE when the going gets tough, then all hell can break lose.  There''s always enough unavoidable chaos (some of it creative)to go around in emerging areas (think wireless  before Wi-Fi bested such contenders as Home RF, and divided the landscape with Bluetooth, or recall the multiplicity of groups that sprang up in the mobile space, to coalesce eventually into OMA â€“ the Open Mobile Alliance). <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, when companies (or nations) decide to drop out of the consensus (or United Nations) process, then uncertainly and tensions build, and the ground gained through years of painstaking credibility building can be rapidly lost. In fact, these two examples are converging right now, as the United States seeks to <a href=''http://www.cbronline.com/blog.asp?show=cbr/2005/10/who_really_runs.html''>defend it''s suzerainty</a> over the Internet root directory from challenge in the WSIS process. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere will this adventure in 802.11 land end up?  Hopefully, with a grand compromise that brings the two-dozen companies, and their new, <a href='' http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,123045,00.asp ''>just announced specification</a>, back into the IEEE, and not to a permanent split between an 801.11 working group standard and a rival specification promoted and maintained by EWC. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBut who knows?  We''ll just have to wait and see.  Because a consensus process is based on, well, consensus.  And if those involved can''t agree, then it''s two steps forward, but three steps back.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that''s a lot more likely to happen when you''ve got three groups all working in their own self-interest, rather than one group working to provide the best solution to end users.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nLike you and me.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Added October 18:  <a href=''http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20051018A5024.html''>"Atheros Communications and Marvell Technology reportedly will begin volume production of their respective WLAN chips compliant with the Enhanced Wireless Consortiumâ€™s (EWC) proposed 802.11n standard in the first quarter of next year, according to sources at Taiwan WLAN device makers."</a>  ', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

For several reasons:  first, Corel was a founding member of the OpenDocument Working Group at OASIS.  Second, Corel''s office suite continues to have a meaningful beachhead in government (one of its only remaining loyal markets).  And finally, I remember WordPerfect with nostalgia, and continue to miss many of the wonderful and easy to use features that Microsoft never bothered to replicate after it ceased to have any meaningful competition in the marketplace.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhile I was not successful in getting a clear answer to this question in my interviews, a story by Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols  in eWeek on September 28 indicated that Corel would support OpenDocument <a href=''http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1864843,00.asp''>"someday"</a>.  That story, based on an interview with Corel communications manager for WordPerfect Greg Wood, was less than satisfying, concluding: "While Corel won''t commit to a date for adding OpenDocument to WordPerfect, the company made it clear that it is working towards that goal."  To underline the point, they quote Wood to the effect that,  "it is not appropriate at this time for Corel to disclose its plans for OpenDocument in future versions of WordPerfect Office."  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhat a strange statement for Corel to make after a decade in the wilderness, especially as Sun, IBM and others are pressing the attack like baying lhounds that have at last caught the fresh scent of their quarry, and are energized by the prospect of blood after an endless night on the trail? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nMy puzzlement turned to disappointment this evening when I read an interview by Ed Oswald at <a href=''http://www.betanews.com/''>BetaNews.com</a> with <a href=''http://www.betanews.com/article/Interview_Corel_on_Sun_Open_Standards/1129672161''>Corel''s Richard Carriere and Wood</a> at BetaNews.com.  The way I read it, Corel has decided that playing it safe as a small number two without meaningful competition is better than going for the gold, but having to worry about new competitors (e.g., the free, open source OpenOffice.org, Sun''s StarOffice and IBM Workplace, among others).  As a result, Carriere falls in behind the Microsoft party line, calling OpenDocument  "a non-supported free product that has been around for many, many years and still does not have any meaningful user base," and then asking, "Is it a competitor? I''m not sure." <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAm I being uncharitable?  Well, see for yourself whether you think that Corel has flipped the coin towards sticking with its non-adventurous, traditional "small piece of a big pie" strategy rather than taking what may be a once in a generation chance to lead the charge to displace Microsoft Office.  </br></p>\r\n\r\nHere''s Carriere again, responding to the question "With the recent news surrounding the release of StarOffice 8 and Massachusetts supporting OpenOffice.org, it seems like the market is ready for alternatives to Microsoft. What do you make of this news, and why is Corel speaking up?": <blockquote>\r\n\r\n[W]hat is very, very interesting is the interest for alternative office suites. \r\nAnd here we are the clear number two with a proven alternative to Microsoft Office, which is highly compatible, has the same feature richness, and where the look and feel acts like Microsoft Office. WordPerfect has been endorsed by very large OEMs like Dell who are distributing millions of copies every year.  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn case the "We''re number two!" point was a little too subtle, he goes on to say:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nTo me, it''s much better news even to companies like Sun, which has a worldwide market share of less than one tenth of a percent by any measurable metric. So in that sense, it''s great news for us. That is the big "so what" of all this news. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat a guy!  I imagine that Sun has already sent him a thank you note for the vote of confidence.  And in case you *still* haven''t twigged, here he goes again:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nGranted, we haven''t done the same kind of extravagant marketing activities or announcements that some other players have done, like Sun with StarOffice, but reality is in the numbers, and we''re selling millions of copies of WordPerfect. To me, this is the bottom line: Sure there is interest and a lot of press around the alternatives, and to me its good news because in the end people look at what''s out there. As I said, we''re the clear number two regardless of the noise that''s made by Sun around StarOffice or OpenOffice. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nGot it â€“ you''re number two, and they''re not.  But how about OpenDocument itself?  On that score, Carriere says: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe are a founding member of OASIS and on the committee for the OpenDocument format, so we are participating in the creation of that standard. The reality is that, today, this standard is not adopted or being used, period.

After what seems like 40 years in the wilderness, Corel has a chance to reach the promised land, with a dynamite product, a quick path towards supporting OpenDocument, the number two market position (did they mention that?), and an established reputation in government, where Massachusetts has just blazed a trail. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut what did it decide to do?  Stick with a "we''re number two" strategy" that gives Sun, IBM, OpenOffice.org, KOffice and anyone else a clear field, a formidable combined budget, a nothing-to-lose and everything-to-gain motive, and a unified marketing message. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWill it work?

Called OpenOpenOffice or O3, it will allow Microsoft Office users to   read and write Open Document Format (ODF) filesâ€¦.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n"Through universal adoption, Open Document Format will bring, for the\r\nfirst time in our industry''s history, the reality of friction-free\r\ninterchange of office documents between different office suites," said\r\n. "The major hold-out here is Microsoft, who refuses to support ODF - a decision that seems based on self-serving reasons, to protect the near-monopoly of their high-priced Office suite.  The ones who will suffer are the users." <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"We believe that Microsoft Office users should have a choice as to which format they store their documents in," [said OSV convener Con Zymaris.] </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to an earlier private Blog post by Kennedy, helping out Microsoft will actually be quite easy.  He confirms this in the press release: <blockquote>\r\n \r\n"The amazing thing about the O3 concept is how simple it is," said key\r\nO3 developer Adam Kennedy. "Just take the Word-to-ODF filters from the\r\nOpenOffice.org suite, and put them into Office in reverse. Microsoft has made it trivial to write plugins for Office using .NET, and the\r\nOpenOffice.org team has put a huge effort into their document conversion filters. So all that''s left is to connect the two together via some simple SOAP calls using C# and Perl, and then make sure it is easy for people to install into Office." <br/></p>\r\n\r\n"By not supporting ODF, Microsoft is placing its interests ahead of its\r\nusers, who will be barred from entering this new sphere of document\r\ninteroperability. This is another sign that the vendor cares little for\r\noffering interoperability and choice to its customers. The open source\r\ncommunity equates such vendor stubbornness with damage, and much like\r\nthe Internet, we will route around it. If Microsoft won''t offer choice\r\nto its Office users, we will do it for them," concluded Zymaris. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo, how easy is "easy?"  According to the <a href='' http://www.phase-n.com/openopenoffice/''> OpenOpenOffice.org Website</a>: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe main feature of this plan is simplicity. It requires no new concepts to be explored, no significant development, and leverages the huge existing body of work already created by the OpenOffice.org developers, the CPAN module authors, and the Microsoft .NET and Office teams.  <i>Initial ballpark estimates are for less than 2,000 lines of code and a few hundred hours of development time to get to an initial stable release of O3. </i> [emphasis added] </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI suspect that we''ll be hearing more thunder in the months ahead.

Now they''re both saying something different -- and they''re both hoping that you''re not paying too close attention.', '<blockquote><i>One reason, I''d like to say, here''s for all Americans to really feel proud to be Americans, uh, you know, blah-blah, woof-woof</i></br>\r\n\r\n\r\nJimi Hendrix, lintroducing the "Star Spangled Banner" (Woodstock, 1969) </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI was minded of the immortal Jimi Hendrix''s sage statement (whatever it meant) at Woodstock when I read the statements of  Corel''s communication manager for WordPerfect <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2064''>Greg Wood</a> and Microsoft''s (nee Groove''s) <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2061''>Ray Ozzie</a> at ZDNet.com today, as quoted by David Berlind and Dan Farber, respectively. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhy?  Because both of their statements carefully say as little definitively as possible, can be read in retrospect to state one thing or its opposite, and are equally deniable from either direction, depending on which way the wind blows in the future.  As proof I''d like to demonstrate that both are completely consistent with what I''ve reported previously, although David reads Corels'' statement exactly the opposite.  Still, both statements are significant in their own way, as each represents definite movement, albeit not far enough to prevent either speaker from scurrying back in the other direction. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nLet''s take Ray Ozzie''s statement first, as it confirms a surprise Microsoft position taken by Microsoft after the Massachusetts OpenDocument announcement  that was first reported <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1642''>here</a> and then widely picked up in blogs around the world from <a href=''http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/18/1451239&tid=109&tid=218''>Slashdot </a> on down.  In the original post, I reported that Microsoft had responded to an article I <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>wrote about OpenDocument</a> by saying it hadn''t said "never" to supporting OpenDocument -- it just hadn''t been asked by its customers to go there yet.  Conveniently, that statement allows Microsoft to have an excuse for changing its mind next week if it so chooses, while still expressing negativity about OpenDocument for as long as it wishes. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSpecifically, in an official response, Microsoft Senior Attorney Nick Tsilas wrote as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAndy, this is not accurate. I think what we have said is that features are dictated by customer demand and, until the Massachusetts-related activity occurred, Open Document was not even on our radar screens.... For us this has been, and will continue to be a matter of evaluating the flow of customer requirements, and this is a new issue. For example, while the timing may be suspect to some, our pdf development was the result of evaluating customer requirements. </blockquote>\r\nThis initial statement has now expanded as follows, as reported by Farber: <blockquote>\r\nOzzie attributed the tentativeness on ODF support in Office to resource allocation issues, mainly based on the user support demands that would crop up given that exporting to ODF won''t have full fidelity with the Microsoft''s own formats without some tweaking. Microsoft is working with a French company on translators to determine the scope of the problem in exporting Office documents to ODF. It sounds to me that support for "Save As" ODF in Office is a "when," not and "if." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI agree with Dan.  It looks like there''s been quite a bit of movement in Redmond in just a few short weeks.  While still paying lip service to backward compatibility issues, Microsoft has now found a French company to help it figure out a solution  (according to <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1667''>Open Source Victoria</a>, that solution may take as little as a couple thousand lines of code - something that OSV plans to prove - and provide - in the near future). <br/></p>\r\n\r\nLet''s turn to David Berlind''s take on a Corel announcement now.  As I reported in <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1663''>Shame on Corel</a>, just a week ago Wood was saying: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe are a founding member of OASIS and on the committee for the OpenDocument format, so we are participating in the creation of that standard. The reality is that, today, this standard is not adopted or being used, period. Of course, we hear news about open standards, because when you create one you don''t need to necessarily rely on one single vendor, and we''re fully supportive of it.  </blockquote>\r\nNow, a scant week later, it comes out like this in an email to David:  <blockquote>\r\nCorel is a strong supporter of the continued development and adoption of the OASIS Open Document Format, and Corel strongly endorses ODF. Corel views Open Standards as a way for customers to maintain seamless and timeless access to their documents, and Open Standards free customers from the risks and costs related to reliance on a single vendor. For these reasons, Corel is actively expressing its strong support for the adoption of open standards industry-wide. We''ve indicated as much to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we''re very optimistic about the potential that ODF, PDF and other open standards hold in helping advance the cause of alternatives to Microsoft. commitment to provide real customer value. I won''t respond to Gary''s comments further, although I will say that WordPerfect Office today possesses very robust XML capabilities and Corel''s willingness and enthusiasm in support of open standards generally is unassailable. Suffice to say, Corel remains committed to working alongside OASIS and other technology vendors to ensure the continued evolution of the ODF standard and the adoption of open standards industry-wide.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDavid thinks that Corel has now confirmed, per Wood, that it will support OpenDocument.  Me, I''m not hearing that.  What I''m hearing is that Wood is being very, very careful <i>not</i> to say that Corel will actually support OpenDocument, although he hopes you won''t notice, with all the air kisses he''s blowing to ODF.  But why?<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy indeed?  Good question.  Instead, Wood says that Corel will support the <i> continued development and adoption </i> of ODF (twice); that it <i>endorses</i> ODF; that it''s <i>optimistic</i> about ODF; and boy, does Corel love open standards.  But it just can''t seem to bring itself to pop the question and actually say "may I support you?" <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo what gives?  I hope the next person that interviews Corel puts them to The Question.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd gets an answer besides Blah Blah Woof Woof. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

TGDaily.comâ€™s Scott M. Fulton, III <a href=''http://www.tgdaily.com/2005/10/26/microsoft_denies_odf_for_office_12/''>posted a story </a> on that statement late last night, which begins as follows:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>Redmond (Washington) - In a statement to TG Daily, a Microsoft spokesperson has officially denied that the company is making plans to support OpenDocument Format (ODF), the XML-based file structure developed for Microsoft Office''s open-source competitor, OpenOffice.org. </b>  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n"We have no plans to directly support the OpenDocument format at this time," reads the statement, e-mailed to us this afternoon. "Our standards-based formats for Office 2003, as well as our announcement that XML will be the default file format in Office ''12,'' have been extremely well received by customers and partners, including over 330,000 developers who are leveraging Office''s XML support already. We fully expect partners, independent companies, and competitors to provide converters between our Open XML formats and the OpenDocument formats, and are aware of a few projects along these lines already."  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe story later observes that "The story leading up to Microsoft''s denial today has more twists and changes of possession than a pro hockey game" and goes on to review recent statements from Corel and Microsoft, blog posts (including <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1663''>one of mine</a>) and speculates about what''s really going on.   <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAll of this reminds me of Kremlinologists in the State Department back in the 60''s trying to figure out whose star was rising and whose was falling by looking at how far, and to which side, of the Fearless Leader they were standing, or perhaps Wall Street trying to unencrypt the latest gnomic statement by Alan Greenspan. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOf course, this latest statement by Microsoft doesn''t really say anything new or different, when compared with any of the previous statements that it''s made, going right back to what may be considered the original statement from Senior Attorney Nick Tsilas that I reported on <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1642''>October 10</a>, which was as follows: <blockquote>\r\n \r\nI think what we have said is that features are dictated by customer demand and, until the Massachusetts-related activity occurred, Open Document was not even on our radar screensâ€¦.For us this has been, and will continue to be a matter of evaluating the flow of customer requirements, and this is a new issue. For example, while the timing may be suspect to some, our pdf development was the result of evaluating customer requirements. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhich, really, is no different than what another Microsoft spokesperson was saying back in June: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nPryke-Smith said Microsoft would not be adopting OpenDocument, citing backwards compatibility concerns, but did say the company will watch to see how adoption of the standard develops. "We''ll respond to customer demand on that," he said. "Our main focus is serving our existing customer base." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf there is a crumb of news here, it would be that Microsoft may have decided that third-party converters will solve it''s problem, at least for now.  Or, of course, that may not be what they''re really thinking at all. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo what we do know (and really all that we know) is the following: <br/></p>\r\n\r\n1.  Microsoft hasn''t said that they will never support OpenDocument. <br/></p>\r\n2.  Microsoft has said that they have no (public) plans to support OpenDocument right now. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWith this statement, I suspect that this is where things will lie until something actually happens in the marketplace to warrant a change of position (like another significant government adoption of OpenDocument). <br/></p>\r\n\r\nNow I wonder what Corel will [not] say today? <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Here''s how you can tell the U.S. Ambassador what you think about that.', '<blockquote><i>The United Nations will not be in charge of the Internet. Period.</i><br/>\r\n   - U.S. Ambassador David Gross</blockquote>\r\nFor over a year I''ve been covering the United Nations sponsored <a href=''http://www.itu.int/wsis/''>"World Summit for the Information Society"</a>  (WSIS) process, which hopes to bring the benefits of the Internet and the Web to all peoples everywhere, a very honorable and important goal.  Not surprisingly, this process has raised the question of "who should control the Internet?"  That question has become extremely emotional, with the United States government saying "Us!" as regards the root directory of  the Internet (which is currently under our control), and the rest of the world saying, in so many words, two words that I won''t repeat here. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAmazingly enough, on November 2, you''ll have the opportunity on-line to tell the U.S. representative in this process who you think should hold the keys.  I''ll tell you how later in this post.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut first, a little background.  Who controls the Internet today? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nRight now, the answer is, "it depends on what aspect you''re talking about."  If you''re talking about the standards that enable the Internet, the answer is a number of non-profit, global consortia (e.g., the W3C and the IETF).  But if you''re talking about the root directory of the Internet - the country codes (in one database) and the individual addresses given to individual computers (in another) -- then you''re talking about the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, popularly referred to as <a href=''http://www.icann.org/''> ICANN</a>.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nICANN is, on the one hand, a non-profit that is headquartered in the U.S. and has an international Board.   But on the other hand, it is subject to the will of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which in turn is a unit of the U.S. Department of Commerce.  And there''s the rub, because theoretically, someone in Washington could call someone in California at ICANN some day and tell him to turn off, oh, say, Iran or North Korea (not that they would, of course).  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo when the WSIS process began, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which might have, but didn''t, bid for control of the Internet during it''s chaotic early days, put the "control of the Internet" on the table (the ITU is an agency of the UN, and is also primarily responsible for organizing and running the WSIS process).  As a result, the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) came into being, and discussion quickly zeroed in on control of the root directory as a matter of international concern. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAll that''s happened in the past two years would fill a book (and doubtless some day will), but if you want to get quickly up to speed, here''s how to go about it.  Start with this article from July of 2004, called <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/july04.php#feature''>Who Should Govern the Internet?</a>  Then go to the ConsortiumInfo.org News Portal <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=25''>WSIS/Internet Governance</a> subcategory, and you''ll find c. 25 articles and blog entries from the past five months tracking what''s been happening leading up to the final WSIS meeting in Tunis, including the recent PrepCon3 meeting in Geneva when even the European Union deserted the U.S.  A particularly good article by Kevin Murphy linked there describes how the current system works. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIn truth, this is a big and important issue, because although today it''s America'' condescending attitude regarding ICANN that is under the microscope, in the future, it will be other issues, including, perhaps, the future technical development of the Internet or the Web, whether content could be censored, and so on.  So what happens in Tunis matters to everyone, in the first world as well as the developing world, because it represents the beginning, and not the end, of the discussion on such issues. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo with that as prelude, here''s how you can let the U.S. government know who you thinks should "govern the Internet" in the future.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe lead representative for the U.S. is \r\n<a href=''http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/46292.htm''>Ambassador David A. Gross</a>, a Bush appointee who has served since August 2001 as the U.S. Coordinator for International Communications and Information Policy in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs.  If you go to an October 28 posting at the USINFO.STATE.GOV site called <a href=''http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2005&m=October&x=20051028142855cmretrop0.290539&t=livefeeds/wf-latest.html''>Expanding Internet Access Must Remain World Focus at Summit</a> you''ll see the current U.S., position.  And at the very end of the post, you''ll find this: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn a November 2 Internet chat, Gross will preview the upcoming WSIS summit and discuss his views on why the current governance structure is the best way to preserve the nature of the Internet as an innovative medium. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nGross will be available to answer questions at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT). To ask a question or make a comment, please register at iipchat@state.gov. Questions and comments are welcome in advance of and during the November 2 program. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo there you have it - your chance to make your point to the man who will make the U.S.''s points in Tunis November 16-18, or at least your chance to see how he answers the opinions of those who do choose to ask questions and make comments. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nEither way, you can follow how things progress here at the <i>Standards Blog</i>, as I will cover the run up to, and the outcome of, the Tunis meeting in detail.  It''s likely that I''ll also dedicate the November issue of the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a> to the same topic.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

It is not disputed that Office is superior in this regard. <br/></p>\r\nBray also quotes from an email message from Alan Yates, general manager of the Microsoft Office business unit, as follows: <blockquote>\r\nWe''re encouraged by the additional and thorough review that the Legislature is pursuing to better understand the costs and issues associated with the existing Massachusetts proposal. </blockquote>\r\nBray goes on to summarize what he has learned from other sources: <blockquote>\r\nSecretary of State William F. Galvin, who oversees the state''s public documents, also opposes the new storage standards, although his office has not explained why.  [State Senator and Post Audit and Oversight Committee Chair]  Pacheco wants to know whether Quinn has the authority to make a major change in the state''s records management policies without input from Galvin. He also wants proof that the benefits of the change would outweigh the cost of switching over. </blockquote>\r\nNone of these issues is new, and each has already been addressed by Commonwealth CIO Peter Quinn, so it''s possible to outline what his responses will be.  That being the case, let''s contrast what Bray covered with what we already know: <br/></p>\r\n\r\nFirst, regarding the disability issue: <br/></p>\r\nAs I reported in the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>lengthy article</a> I presented in September on OpenDocument, of the total of 157 public comments received by the Information Technology Division (ITD), 97 are best classified as endorsements of the proposed amendments, and 46 submissions are best classified as critical (13 are difficult to classify).  Of the critical comments, seven are submissions by Massachusetts public officials, and six are brief, identical form letters.  The great majority of the remaining negative submissions were sent by individuals that are blind, or by representatives of three organizations concerned with those with disabilities.  \r\nIt''s also worth noting that some who attended the public hearing held on August 16, where the disability issue was brought up, felt that the ITD was behind the curve on the issue.  In fact, the <a href=''opendocformfaqs.doc''>  FAQ </a> posted at the ITD Website on September 25 admits as much.  The sole FAQ question on the topic addresses the accessibility as follows: <blockquote>\r\n1.	QUESTION: Arenâ€™t the products that support Open Document Format inaccessible to persons with disabilities? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nANSWER:  ITD thanks the advocates within the community of persons with disabilities who brought this issue to our attention. ITD is aware that there are some accessibility issues related to use of office applications that support the Open Document Format. ITD is working with the community of persons with disabilities and programmers within and associated with that community to address this issue. Under Final ETRM Version 3.5, agencies can retain copies of MS Office as needed for disabled employees and other citizens.  The legal rights of employees and other citizens with disabilities will take precedence over any particular implementation of the Revised Final ETRM V. 3.5. </blockquote>\r\nAdmittedly, it should not have taken those with disabilities to bring such an issue to the attention of a government employer. <br/></p>\r\nSo this issue is not new, and the germane questions will be whether the accommodation referred to in the FAQ should be an adequate plan.  Superficially, it sounds workable, if klugey, in contrast to the stated goals of the policy. <br/></p>\r\nThe second issue has to do with whether Commonwealth CIO Quinn had the authority to adopt the policy.  This again is old news, and was raised in a number of the comment letters received (see my <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>article</a> again for a detailed review of who raised which points).  It was also addressed in great detail in the FAQ, and Quinn answered conclusively during my interview with him in preparation for the article that the legal issues had been thoroughly investigated by a staff attorney.  The issues are too technical to go into in detail here, but are clearly laid out in the FAQ. <br/></p>\r\nWhich leaves only the comment from Alan Yates to address, which shows no new cards. If you were to track all of his prior public comments, they would read almost word for word (and perhaps word for word) the same. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo it would appear that the attack on Monday will focus on three topics:  accessibility to the disabled; legality of process; and cost.  I plan on attending the hearing on Monday and will report in detail what transpires. <br/></p>\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Senator Pacheco doesn''t understand the difference between open source and open standards (and certainly doesn''t understand the difference between OpenDocument and OpenOffice).  More than once, he indicated that he thought that the policy would require the Executive Agencies to use OpenOffice, not realizing that there are other compliant alternatives.  He also thought that this would act to the detriment of Massachusetts software vendors, who (he thinks) would be excluded from doing business with the Commonwealth. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n2.  What he has most obviously been fed by MS et al is that "The way that this was handled is counter to what open source is all about" (e.g., this, even thought it seemed to be pretty clear that he doesn''t really know what open source software really is, or what the GPL is, although he referred to it often). It''s therefore hard to believe that he could have ever connected these dots on his own. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n3.  More than anything, this is a turf battle between different factions within Massachusetts, and Pacheco is going to make sure that Quinn isn''t going to get away with it if he can help it (and he thinks he can). Pacheco views as high-handed behavior that hasn''t kowtowed to the power of other agencies. On the plus side, there were some indications in his comments that a simple delay of a few months may allow honor to be satisfied.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n4.  The hearing was stacked against the positive, in that although Quinn and ITD General Counsel Linda Hamel were given plenty of opportunity to speak and answer questions, no one else who was in favor of the new policy was permitted to give testimony (I know of at least one major, supporting vendor that tried and was refused), nor were any questions from the audience allowed.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n5.  Pacheco doesn''t think that it''s over yet, and clearly wants (at minimum) a delay in the schedule to acknowledge the influence of other Commonwealth governmental interests. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n6.  Pacheco expects that the Auditors Office will have all of the time that it needs to chew over what sounds like is only a fairly high-level cost/benefit analysis supplied by the ITD. He clearly wants more, and also wants it reviewed by what he regards to be a neutral source -- the Auditors Office. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n7.  Supervisor of Public Records Alan Cody flat out stated that Quinn and Hamel are wrong in saying that they acted in accordance with law.  Pacheco did not ask him whether he stated this conclusion based on advice of counsel, or otherwise how he reached this conclusion. Hamel, in contrast, researched the matter extensively, and answered (I thought) persuasively.  Pacheco, by the way, cited several specific cases to make his points. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n8.  Pacheco repeatedly acknowledged that the Advisory Board does not have the power to tell the ITD what to do.  What he did come back to was a contention that there was to be a "collaborative process," that would involve more parts of the government, and particularly its officers.  Hamel, in contrast, cited a Supreme Judicial Court case to the effect that the high court expressly held that there was to be no central bureaucracy dictating IT policy. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n9.  The disability issues are real, and the ITD seems to have been caught off guard on this.  They should have been all over this issue a year ago, but seem to be going in the right direction now.  Still, a bad tactical -- and ethical -- mistake. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n10.  It seems fair to assume that Microsoft is playing a behind the scenes role.  If so, they have been very careful to stay out of sight.  There was no overt mention of what they may be doing, or whom they may have talked to, and Pacheco chastised Hamel at one point for suggesting that they had "bought" associations that made negative comments [imagine that!].  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n11.  It was not clear what happens next vis-Ã -vis the ITD.  It was clear that Pacheco expects to pursue matters further with the Auditors Office, regarding costs to implement the new policy, and that he expects to gather more data outside and after the hearing.  It was also clear that the biggest issue in his mind is not the cost, and not the technology, but the process.  He is clearly unhappy with how things have proceeded, and emphasized this over and over, including to reporters after the hearing. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n12.  All witnesses indicated that they had not been contacted in advance, and the representatives of the disabled community (including Massachusetts representatives)were telling and persuasive in this regard.  Clearly, the ITD did not do its homework in this area.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n13.  Lastly, and in some ways most ominously, there was no real participation by Secretary of the Commonwealth Francis Galvin''s office.  Hence, there may be another shoe to drop, and we learned nothing about what that shoe may be today, or when it may fall.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThese are what impressed me as being the high points of the hearing.  I may revise this on Tuesday if I have a chance (while traveling to, and in meetings in Washington) to reread my record of the meeting. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPart II:  The real-time testimony <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA.  Introduction <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI''m sitting in Room 437 of the Massachusetts State House waiting for the ODF Hearing to begin momentarily.  I will update this post every few minutes with an account of who is testifying, and what they are saying. In the interests of time I won''t be doing much tagging, so apologies in advance for mis-formatting.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nIt''s ten minutes past show time, and the room is filling up (and heating up), with even standing room running out.  Rather ironically, there was a last minute room switch from a room that *was* easily handicap-accessible to one that either isn''t, or was not obviously so to many, with about four steeps steps and swinging doors half way up.  Given that much of the commentary today may focus on ODF''s current Spartan support for the blind, it''s not an auspicious beginning.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nB.  Caveats\r\n\r\nCAUTION: While I am a very rapid typist and got much of Pacheco''s comments almost word for word, I could not hear everyone well, and sometimes was paraphrasing more than others as I tried to keep up. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAND NOTE:  I will try and do some sort of summary later as well of the key surprises and/or inaccuracies that struck me as hearing progressed. <br/></p>\r\n \r\nC.  Attendance <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPress:  I see Hiawatha Bray (Boston Globe), David Berlind (ZDNet).<br/></p>\r\n\r\nCompanies: I see folks I recognize from IBM, HP, Sun.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nConstituencies:  Many representatives of the disability community <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAudience:  c. 100, 2/3s of whom had to stand <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAt the front:  Senator Marc R. Pacheco, Chair, Committee on Post Audit and Oversight Senator Richard Moore, and a Justice Stannessa (sp?), who never spoke.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n1.  First presenting: Peter Quinn and Linda Hamel (sp?), General Counsel of ITD.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nPacheco opens:  Presents a statement of process, and reviews stakeholders.  Right now he''s noting the oversight committee; committee will consider testimony of all stakeholders and industry representatives with whom he and others have met over the past several weeks and years.  "What we want to concentrate on today is the process that we have followed to get to this point in time; go over public records issues involved; look at actual procurement of services here in the Commonwealth and how its done; and certainly the costs.".<br/></p>\r\n\r\nThanks Quinn and Hamel, asks Quinn to review process and authority.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQuinn:  I will read a statement first.  I want to correct misunderstandings.  Historical perspective:  MA is a hodgepodge of applications.  Agencies must now share across all boundaries; cannot do so without building extensive interfaces - everything must talk to everything without expensive retrofitting.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nAt recommendation of a study, began to build interoperable systems model, based on a framework released to by the Federal Government to the State CIOs, based on a service based architectural model (SOA).  Various versions of the ETRM have been created and released and refined.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nMany governments - local, state and national - are reviewing ODF, because some XML formats are proprietary.  ODF was developed by an open process, and documents created using ODF will be able to be open and read 100 years from now. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth''s documents belong to the people, and need to be accessible to the people now and in the future. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me clarify:  the new policy applies only to the Executive Agencies.  It does not apply to the Judiciary, although the Judiciary is actually way ahead of us, with over 2000 desktops already ODF enabled. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSecond:  Adoption of ODF does not apply to legacy documents, and legacy systems will be retained until such time as it becomes cost effective to access legacy systems using ODF compliant applications.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNext:  Adoption of ODF opens the door to competition, rather than closes it.  Any vendor has it within its control to support ODF.  We really don''t care how a document is created and manipulated - only that it be accessible in the future. ODF will provide that assurance<br/></p>\r\n\r\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to present to you and cure these misconceptions.  I hope that I will be able to directly address critical comments. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n1:30 PM:  Questions from Pacheco:  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  You said that you were following recommendations from 2002. Can you tell me who made these recommendations? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Price Waterhouse/Coopers, the successful bidder.  IBM bought the unit and the same team continued.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  How did the Advisory Board come into being?  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  We helped create it.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Do you remember the one recommendation they have given to date? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  [didn''t catch it well]<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Involve all departments; engage the constitutional officers.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  [Hamel]:  We included each of the constitutional officers after they were accidentally got left out of the legislation - we got them back in, and have involved them.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  The intent was for them to be involved, and for their input to be seriously considered.  That they would have a role and input. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Hamel: The intention was not that they have any role in creation of proposal, but that they create a strategic plan annually.  The judiciary pushed very hard not to have a central administration involved in this type of decision.  There was no question that they should be telling ITD what to do, or to check in with them.\r\n\r\nQ:  I have some constitutional questions, but will come back to them later.  After we had our last Post Audit Committee meeting on this in 2003, the Legislature proactively adopted a statute that laid out an advisory process that the Legislature assumed would be followed.  That''s the newest law that''s on the books on the topic.  Are you suggesting that the Judiciary ignored this intent, or do you think that the language passed was unconstitutional?  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  No<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Let me be clear.  The intent was to expand the scope of the Advisory Committee, so why wasn''t it done?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I want to distinguish between internal polices of the Executive Agencies and the idea of meeting to create a strategic policy that would involve the input of all.  The Advisory is required to advise, but the ITD is not required to consult with them.  I was personally "rapped on the wrist" by the Judiciary pointing me at a decision in the past that stated it would be unconstitutional to create a central authority for this purpose.  So we were very careful to be sure that the legislation only said "advisory."  There is nothing in the constitution of our state that would permit such a board, and would stray from the text of the enablement of the Advisory Board. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWe have tried mightily to share our information with the Advisory Board, and I personally met with them to brief them on my meetings with Microsoft regarding their XML formats.  At that point, we were not yet sure what we would do regarding the XML piece; this was back in May.  We shared our efforts to try to work with the majority of desktops, and expressed our doubts in being able to do so.  No one said at the Advisory Board not to go in this direction - I was there and made this presentation. They were our partners in pushing forward in this way. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  All that you said still doesn''t answer my question.  The legislation says that the Advisory Board (AB) "shall draft" a recommendation.  Granted, it didn''t have the authority to enact or dictate.  It did recommend that the Constitutional officers be brought in and involved in the process before decision was made.  It was to be a collaborative process, so that people could raise their objections. Isn''t it true that some on the AB were critical?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Yes, there were some.  Senator Hart delivered a dissenting letter.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Quotes from ERTM Webpage: why did you not include all of Section 17 of the law??<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I wrote that in about 45 minutes in the middle of a room full of people.  Both the Secretary of the Commonwealth and the ITD have the authority over archives.  But the Secretary only looks over paper archives.  Only we have been involved in electronic storage.  We have over 188 million employee records. We have tried on a number of occasions to reach out to the Secretary, and have not been able to do so. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  The full text of Section 17 includes more - the Supervisor of Records; The Records Conservation Board "shall determine".  Are you saying that this is not a "regulation" and not a standard? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  That''s right.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  And therefore that it doesn''t need the approval of the Supervisor or Records? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  You have to read this in the context of the whole set of laws.  There are laws that were created in a different world about how long to save records and when you could throw them away.  We are a successor agency, and there is something of a "creative tension" between the old laws and the new laws. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  A "creative tension?" <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Yes.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  I''ll have to look that up in the General Laws.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Gives examples of other situation where the old laws aren''t working and need to be updated. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Asks questions about Herald and Globe articles.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA:  Are you asking me about the Globe or the law?  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  [doesn''t sell well]<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA:  I''m sorry.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:  Has the Library of Congress adopted ODF?  So we have a proposal from the ITD we go with ODF.  Has the Library of Congress made the same decision?  Have they said "use OpenOffice?" Answer me yes or no.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  No - and neither have we.  We haven''t mandated the specific product? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Isn''t that the practical situation?  Isn''t that the only product?  That''s my understanding [of course, this is not true.]<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA:  That is not ITD''s understanding.  And as the PDF decision of Microsoft shows, they could support it as well. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  In the same time frame that your policy requires? Let us go back to the Secretary of State position.  Are you aware of the 66 page booklet he has written on public records?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I have a copy on by desk.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  It says, we are working on electronic archiving policies that would apply also to all municipalities.  That sounds different from what you are saying. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  We look first to the enabling legislation.  We do not think that such a booklet should be all that we look at. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Let''s look now at your statement that this is a standard, and not at regulation.  In your policy, what would support this?  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Quinn:  The format is supported by a number of different products - that''s a standard.  Standards are good for industry and competition.  This isn''t a procurement play - the largest vendor could comply if it wished.  Two years ago we made a decision to go to open standards, and everyone agreed.  The standard was developed by OASIS, and has been submitted to ISO. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWe''ve had hearings and meetings and invited comment.  On June 9 we had a meeting, and everyone said that XML in an open format was the way to go - with the exception of one company. We also gave preferential treatment to vendors to give them the opportunity to support ODF.  That one company has wonderful technology, and I hope they decide to support ODF.  But they have taken "closed" positions in the past. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  I''m curious.  We''ve seen this before; we have a memo, and then two months later we have a policy.  Then negotiations with the ITD. It''s my understanding that in January of this year that Secretary Kriss had announced at a MA Software Council meeting that there had been agreement that Office would be included in the new ETRM. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Yes, that was in the draft, which was put out for comment, and there was a firestorm of objection. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So let me get this straight - there was agreement between you, Kris and this company that if the license agreement was satisfactory, that they would be in the ETRM? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Hamel:  we entered into a negotiation with them, based on our understanding of what "open" means.  Since then, we''ve met with the open source; I mean open standards; community, and we''ve been educated.  We did express that we did not get everything that we wanted, and we briefed the AB on that (what we got, and what we didn''t).  We were told by them, and now understand, that "it wasn''t open enough." <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  You''re asking me to believe that Secretary Kriss didn''t know enough?  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Hamel:  I''m not going to assume I know what he did or didn''t know. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQuinn:  I''ll send you a document saying what his assumptions would and would not be in the Microsoft license. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Why did you correct yourself about "open source?"<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Open Standards can be implemented in open source or in proprietary software. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So let me see if I understand.  Isn''t ODF distributed under something called the GPL? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Not necessarily; some are and some aren''t. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  That''s not what I''ve heard, and I want to be sure that I understand what''s going on here.  I want to be sure that an objective body like the ITD would review cost and some of the assumptions that have been made.  I am concerned when I look at proprietary companies bidding on work under the ODF that if you have an OpenOffice product that has GPL as one of the elements, then in order to meet the standard the proprietary company would need to release its code? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  No.  That is not correct or necessary, no more than Microsoft would need to reveal PDF code.\r\n\r\nQuinn:  We don''t care about the code - just that we can open the document later.  Procurement is not the issue - the standard is.  That makes it an open field. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  If at the end of the day that''s what we''re talking about, then that''s something else.  What we want is for everyone to be able to compete and participate.  There''s a large portion of Massachusetts software vendors that I understand this policy would preclude from participating.  I need the ITD to help us with that.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut more important than the technology piece is that when you look at the governmental responsibility of cumulative government services that the costs -- or savings -- and the statutory entitlement.  That this went right.  That''s why we''re here today and what we''re looking into. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Hamel:  In order to stimulate competition, you have to look at the situation today, where almost all the desktops are from a single vendor.  We see this as flinging the door open. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  I''ve had numerous meetings with industry, and we''ve all been told that they can participate today.  So it seems like there is one entity that the way the structure is set up, unless they change, I''d be curious to see what type of message that sends - telling people what type of business model they have to assume.  Why is it that Citizens Against Government Waste have taken a position against this, saying its anti-competitive?  Have you read their concerns, and tried to understand what they are saying? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Hamel:  I think that with the exception of the disability organizations, almost all of the organizations that have come out against ODF have been funded by Microsoft.  No individual citizens (the disabled aside) have said that their due process rights.  The playbook was written, and orchestrated by Microsoft. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Are you saying that these are subsidiaries of Microsoft?  Are you saying that they have been bought?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I am saying that they have been influenced.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQuinn:  On August 16 everyone, with the exception of Microsoft and one person who didn''t know what he was talking about, came out in favor of open standards.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  It still seems to me that you''re telling me that, in effect, you''re telling me the "type of tires I have to put on my car" rather than how long a car can be, so that it can fit in a parking space.  Now maybe you''re telling me know that this isn''t the case.  But I suggested that the policy be delayed until two other officers could review it?  And why, two years ago, when you knew that there were concerns from the disability community, would you move forward without pursuing a more collaborative approach?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWe''ve got people calling in from all over with strong concerns over how this has been done, and they are in favor of open standards.  Why are there all these concerns if these concerns were handled as the process went along?  We talked about this in December of 2003, and now its October of 2005 -- and there are still concerns about what you''re doing.  I go back to this OpenOffice piece - you reference other products.  OK, if that''s all accurate, maybe that''s not what this is about, but that''s what these other officers are about - checks and balances to be sure that''s the case.  That''s why there''s an AB, playing an advisory capacity, not to tell you what to do.  I think the last six meetings have even been cancelled. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQuinn: Let me talk about the disability community issue.  The disability community has been denied access in many ways for many years, and we are committed to making sure that they get the consideration they need.  Now I have had someone spending a significant amount of time since September 1 reaching out, and also working with the w3C, and we are just a few weeks away from announcing that we will have an answer to create accessibility.  I have committee three times, first, to create a memo on the subject, two, have priority, and three [couldn''t catch it].  Sun, IBM and others are working to create global accessibility standards.  The structure has already been built into StarOffice, Mozilla, and other products.  We are a couple of weeks away from being able to put this in front of the disability community and the state.\r\n\r\nHamel:  Microsoft has been a great business partner, and that''s why we''d like to continue to work with them.  They''ve been good at solving disability issues, and we look forward to working with them. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  It''s the process that''s my concern.  We had the 2003 memo; we had a policy that was put in place in November of that year that got a green light; we had a Post Audit Committee meeting in December where we raised some of these concerns; but the AB committee came out of 2004, and recommended MOUs with the Constitutional Office to address some of these issues, and it wasn''t done.  The standard itself was released on Labor Day Weekend. [ASU: not correct] Let me just say that a statement was made the standard was created through an open and transparent process -- the open source movement -- and yet it seems to me that the intent of the ETRM subverts the whole spirit of the open source movement, and that''s what I''m concerned about the most.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nAnd that takes me to the last piece I want to ask about, and that''s the cost.  Let me take you back to the November of 2003.  Was there a cost analysis done then?\r\n\r\nA:  Quinn:  There was not. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So there was a decision by the Executive branch, through the ITD, to send 50,00 desktops in a different direction, with no cost analysis. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Let''s back up a minute.  Back then we didn''t have any standards, and there was agreement that we should get software that could talk too each other.  So each time we needed to replace something, we looked to see whether it should be replaced with open source or open standards, based on cost.  So it wasn''t a single decision, but a decision made every time. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  When we met in 2003,I thought we had this discussion, and that you were going to do this analysis.  Now we''re here two years later, and we just received an analysis two weeks ago.  I''ve sent it to the State Audit Office IT division for an audit.  There were assumptions built into that analysis, like moving to MS Office 12.  Why was that in there?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  You asked "what would it look like if we converted the entire set of desktops?"  That''s not what we''re proposing.  Sometime over the next several years all of these desktops will be replaced in the ordinary course of things, due to the need for more speed and functionalities.  I''m sure that the Audit Office will look at this, it will prove out.  We''ve been doing the same sort of changes over the last 15 years. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  One thing we requested and you had for a time suggested was that Office would still be there for a while.  Is there a fee? <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA:  Its a one-time fee.  We don''t have maintenance fees in our contracts.  Will there be some Office applications around?  Sure.  Two or three times a week I get things I can''t open.  We''ll always keep around some licenses so that we can open what we get from the public - something we can''t control. You mention OpenOffice: that can open everything, and will be able to do that in years, and we won''t be able to do that with Microsoft. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Explain to me again the components that you look to when you do your cost analysis.  I would think that in 2003 you would have done a cost benefit analysis.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Quinn: [goes through methodology of adding up costs for replacement in comparison to upgrading to Office 12; goes through labor costs, upgrade costs, etc.]The spreadsheet shows it all.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  How about maintenance? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I do it the same way everyone else does (and most people don''t buy maintenance on Office), but we handle it the same way for all products. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  We usually look at total costs and benefits of competing products, and estimated maintenance, consulting, or other costs.  It''s interesting that you don''t have anything in there for productivity options.  It''s my understanding that we don''t actually have to do to office 12 at all, and that the existing systems can be updated under our existing agreements without any additional costs, even if we replace the hardware.  I can ask my IT specialists to look at that.  Did you look at the alternative choices, and if so, where''s the backup. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Let''s look at things one at a time.  You never "have" to do anything.  But we''ve been looking for a year at how people use their desktops, with all of the powerful tools.  In fact, most people just open documents and spreadsheets, browse the Internet, and use calendars.  So we''ve bought this powerful tool (Office) with all these functionalities, and its like a TV remote with all these features they don''t use.  So our question is really why should we be spending so much for something that we don''t really use?  For the most part, people didn''t get even the free upgrades. Upgrades are more like an annuity for vendors - its'' a pretty dismal investment for us. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So you''re telling me that when the Auditors Office is done, that using your assumptions, there will be a savings of $26 million, even though in a memo you received back in 2003 from then Sec. Kriss, he acknowledged that "the policy will take time, energy and money.  We have a large installed basis of systems using obsolete technology that cannot quickly be replaced."  What was he talking about - these systems?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  The system over all.  We''ve been gradually changing all kinds of systems - he wasn''t talking about desktops, and we haven''t been touching them until now, because its difficult.  But now there''s a compelling reason, based on what we think we know over the past several years. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  There are just a couple of things I''d like to request today.  One is that I''d like to specifically ask General Counsel to send to us your analysis of how you can move forward statutorily, so that we can analyze what you have told us today, and give us time to study it from a legal perspective.  Also, on the AB piece, I heard reference to constitutionality issues, and I''d simply like to refer you to Doe v. the Attorney General [didn''t catch cite].  You might want to take a look at it from a cautionary perspective.  Also , MBTA v. the State Auditor (2000), saying that the ITD is barred from challenging the constitutionality of laws.  I''m saying today that that law establishing the AB did not set forth a dictatorial tone, but a desire to obtain as much collaboration as possible.  That''s what we were hoping to see.  We''d like to get an opinion back from your office in this regard as well.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n  We would also like to have further discussion on cost benefit analysis, after the Auditor''s Office has a chance to review; we''ll have more questions.  We thought the analysis would be a lot more detailed, with a lot more backup.  For example, just in the case of HR, we would have looked to see it broken down across cost centers.  I want to be sure that what you gave me is what you want to have on the public record. I''d think you''d want to take a second look, and I''d also like to know when the analysis was done, what meetings were held, what IT officers in the Executive Agencies you talked to, and what they had to say.  I''m sure that the Auditors Office will want to see a lot of the same things, so it won''t be duplicative.\r\n <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSen. Moore:  Just an observation.  I''ve watched the ITD and others implement policy.  You are calling them "standards", but for all intents and purposes they are in effect regulations.  Another agency we looked at hadn''t implemented any agencies, and I think that neither agency is doing it right.  My major concern as Health Care Finance is that these issues be satisfied, so that there is access for all people from the Commonwealth for health records.  I need you to make me comfortable with that issue.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nQuinn:  No, I don''t have a closing statement, but I would like the opportunity to wrap up at the end of the day.,  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n2.  Supervisor of Public Records Alan Cody takes witness stand. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nStatement:  I am responsible for putting all records into custody.  My office recommends the policy for doing so.  For many years, electronic records have been a major focus. Let me assure you - we do not have a crisis.  We are in a transition.  But this does not alter the basics of records management.  The vast majority of records have a lifespan of 7 years, after which they are supposed to be destroyed, whether they are electronic or paper, and this is vital.  For those records that must be maintained longer, we have a policy to review the record to see if it has archival content, and if so, to preserve it.  All records are converted into multiple formats to guarantee future access.  We use many different types of proprietary and non-proprietary software, and gives us flexibility to keep up with technology.  A rigid process, such as the one before you, that bars a vendor and introduces rigidity will not serve the Commonwealth''s best interests.  I would be happy to answer any questions. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Pacheco:  It''s obvious that you do not favor the ITD policy at this time, but would like to study it further.  Earlier I referenced a section of the law (17A) from which the ITD stated it derived its authority.  What is your view? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  It''s absurd to think that one authority will be able to control all policies all across the Commonwealth. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:  So you''re saying that if the ITD were to move forward with a policy that is contrary of what you are recommending, that they would be in violation of law?<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA:  Absolutely.  If ITD thinks that their authority is exclusive, I don''t know where they are getting that, and have told them that.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Is it clear that the Secretary Quinn and General Counsel Hamel were aware of the degree of your opposition to ODF and their read of their authority?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Yes.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So its safe to say that you did not collaborate on this policy?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  That''s right.  I was allowed to see it, but it always seemed to be changing, and I wasn''t sure what they wanted, or when they wanted it.  I was told at the very beginning that this would go forward. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So they said right in the beginning that it would happen regardless? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  That''s right. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  And to be clear:  you think that they do not have the authority to move forward unilaterally? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  No I do not believe that they do. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  To what extent did you have any conversations with any one in the AB regarding the MOU? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I have not attended any of the meetings at which this may have been discussed, <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  We''ve looked at many AB meetings since this process began, and they''ve been infrequent and in the last six cases or so cancelled. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI didn''t expect you to be as direct or as certain about what we had assumed, so I really don''t have a lot of other questions, as I''m hearing you to say that you do not believe that they have the authority under Mass. General Laws to proceed. Is that correct? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Absolutely. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Sen. Moore:  The Health committee is very concerned about medical records, in the wake of the Katrina disaster, and we will want to discuss that with you in the future.\r\n\r\nQ:  Pacheco:  I want to compliment you on your work over the years working with the public records.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIs there a motion that can be filed in the courts in a situation such as this, where there is a disagreement between parts of the government? <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA:  There is vague language in the statute that may offer an avenue.  I don''t know if you want me to go into that now. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Please get back to me on this.  I''m quite frankly more concerned about the process than the technology.  We have a process here, and the integrity of the process needs to be maintained.  The legislature has put forth an AB in 2004 that''s supposed to be advisory, yes, but certainly collaborative as well.  And it seems that this has been prevented.  While there have been a few calls going back and forth and some meetings, this isn''t enough. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n[brief break - and my batteries are running low.] <br/></p>\r\n\r\n[I returned too late from a phone call to catch the first five minutes of the next speaker <br/></p>\r\n\r\n3.  I now call Myra Berloff, and Barbara Lyberger of the Mass. Office on Disability<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWe learned only when the public learned of the new policy proposal.  Our concern and goal is to be sure that whatever software is used gives the same accessibility to those with disabilities as to those that are not disabled.  Access issues are being tested in the courts.  Certainly it would be fundamentally wrong in the court of public opinion to take a step backwards regarding access.  We are pleased to be working now with ITD to achieve this result.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So I heard you to say that you did not have advance warning of the policy? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  That''s right. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ: And you said that you are meeting with ITD now? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  That''s right.  We''ve been meeting with ITD for six weeks, and have been given assurance that new software will not be installed that does not have as good access as now.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  And did I understand you to say that you don''t think that this can be achieved by the schedulded implementation date for the policy? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I''m not a technicion, but I''m told by others that are that the schedule is very ambitious.  And also that the programs do not exist today that would be adequate, and that when there are, they will be untested initially. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  So the conversations were not held with the Office of Disabilities, and therefore also this could not have been factored into the cost analysis. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I can''t speak to that. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  How many people do you think will be impacted by this in the Commonwealth? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I knew you''d ask, and we don''t keep such statistics.  And assistive technology figures don''t include everyone who may actually have  problem.  The Federal Government says that 19% self-identify as being disabled.  I would estimate that more that 19% of Massachusetts employees use some type of assistive technologies. In fact, not everyone who is disabled can work. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  If you would like to supplement your testimony at any time in the future, or if you have any estimate of your own cost center and your own budget, we would be better informed if you would provide it.  And we will update you as well.  Thank you. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nNext, I call Gerry Berrier - Bay State Council for the Blind and John Winske - Disability Policy Counsel\r\n\r\n4.  Statement of Mr. Berrier:\r\n\r\nI have used many technologies over the years, and today I am pleased to say that there are many programs that the blind can use.  And we oppose this policy until we are assured that this will not work to the disadvantage of State workers with disabilities.  We''ve had many situations in the past where we were told "let''s just put this in place and see what happens."  Its like building the house first, and being promised that the wheelchair ramp will come later.  Sometimes accessibility can''t be provided later, and when it can, it is always more expensive.  Accessibility planning needs to be done advance.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most problematic programs, as a matter of fact, has been PDF.  In order for it to be accessible with a screen viewer, it must be created with the latest standards, and I think that most people don''t even know that these standards exist.  I''ve learned that the Labor Department has recently moved away form ODF, because of a lack of technical support for the ODF platform.  They believe, and I do too, that open source is still in its infancy, and that the support is not there yet. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIf we want to have accessibility, we''re going to need a full-time office in the Commonwealth that works to achieve accessibility.  We''ve been through many technology swings, and we want to make sure that this is not another bad experience for those with disabilities.  Its a matter of our civil rights. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPacheco:  Thank you for your testimony.  It would be helpful if we could get your comments in a way that we can share them with others.  If you can get us a copy of your testimony that would be helpful. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  Do you have a particular format in mind? <br/></p>\r\n\r\n5.  Testimony of John Winske<br/></p>\r\n\r\n[it was extremely hard to hear this speaker]<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWe are here to protest the policy proposed.  [missed sentence] This will have an adverse economic impact, and we are concerned about this move without due consideration for our community.  As a self-described techno-junky, I subscribe to [?] and saw the first ODF story; I was [not pleased?]  We received no responses from our comments, and during the public comment period, our calls only received a "we will get back to us shortly."<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhy are we concerned?  Because those with disabilities use many assistive technologies, none of which work with ODF today.  Right now, ODF implementation would mean that no employee depending on assistive technologies could use their computers.  Already, those with disabilities have great difficulty gaining employment; the Commonwealth is a significant employer of those with disabilities.  We cannot afford to be further impacted. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, two agencies involved with training and working with those with disabilities were unaware of this new policy.  The equipment they use would now be useless.   I now feel like we are in the closing seconds of a process, and only now is anyone saying, "Oh yeah, we need to worry about people with disabilities."  We also worry about whether people can speak up, and keep their job. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOver time, equipment can be made to be made accessible, but promises can be broken.  People with disabilities are a small part of the population; there is not enough incentive to vendors to build products to assist us.  And there is no incentive to build more than one screen reader, so we will not have options. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAlso this is a poor policy to make public documents accessible.  A great many records are already not accessible, possibly in violation of the law. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI do use open source software, and I do not like monoliths.  But I can say that this policy has been made rashly, and we are being closed out again.  I thank you. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPacheco:  I hope that you will make your statement available to us. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I will within the week. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  Mr. Berrier, were you contacted in advance?\r\n\r\nA:  No, we were not.\r\n\r\n[Ben Highland (sp?) joins in at the witness table]\r\n\r\nQ:  I think that its important that you have come forward to speak.\r\n\r\nMr. Berrier now gives a demonstration of using a screen reader, using MS Office.\r\n\r\nWhen I use the reader, it repeats what I say, and tells me what font I am using, and I can change it.  I worked in a large corporation until recently, and was able to edit what other people wrote.  In fact, other people would come to me to help find typos, because the typo correction software is so good.  Training is required, but it is not difficult.  It opens up a whole new world; I can look up a word in a dictionary, or order groceries, or do many other things.  I''m not a Microsoft flunky, but I''m not a Microsoft basher, either.  Its simply the best of what''s out there today. <br/></p>\r\n[technical difficulties curtail the demonstration]<br/></p>\r\n\r\n6.  Next the committee calls John Beveridge (sp?), IT Audit Division<br/></p>\r\n\r\n[it was hard to hear this speaker as well]\r\n\r\nWe are having a first meeting with Mr. Quinn tomorrow, and what I would like to speak about today is my reaction to the cost analysis.  I deemed it to be a high level overview, rather than a detailed analysis.  We submitted a proposal on August 9th [did I hear the right date?], but its difficult to tell right now whether the benefits claimed will really be achievable. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhat I would really like to see would be for a real, long term analysis to be done, and not work with data that is several years old.  I think that what''s needed is to build real models that would also reflect management costs.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nPacheco: Is it possible for any analysis to be complete in this type of situation?\r\n\r\nA:  Its difficult; you''d have to map it across assumptions.  It''s been very useful for me to sit here today; I''ve learned a lot.  The technology should help people do their jobs.  I think there''s merit to the thought that we don''t use all software functionalities.  I''m not sure that the solution is to take them away, however.  I''m somewhat on the fence about ODF.  But that''s different from keeping to a January 2007 deadline.  I''d like to be able to be back to you with more exact thoughts soon. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ: I''ve met with a number of associations, who favor the ODF policy, although I''ve heard different things from each of them about what it would mean to them.  It surprised me that they would be supporters, but for different reasons.  It puts you in a position where quite frankly you don''t know who to believe.  And that''s why we have an independent Auditors Office, so it can take a look at what the Executive Office is putting on track and, in this case, quite quickly, when some in government aren''t even aware of it.  That''s stunning, that we would be moving forward that quickly with an agenda that may not be all that it''s cracked up to be.  That''s why I was hoping that the ITD would hold up - maybe just a bit - a month or two - to let the officers weigh in, and let your office really take a look at this.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nI''d like to see some independent direction, and quite frankly, we haven''t received that.  We''ve received self-serving testimony from all kinds of groups.  I''ve met with just about everyone who''s involved here, and they''re all great.  But it doesn''t necessarily mean that they are not going to each put their own spin on it, and I don''t blame them for doing so.  So I''m looking for some objectivity from you. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo I''m hearing that sufficient information is not there right now. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  I''m hopeful that that will begin to be available, staring tomorrow. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  But what can we expect? <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  It will probably take us a few weeks to get our arms around it; we''ll need to understand how it relates to other initiatives; I expect that a few weeks from now we''ll begin to be able to give you an estimate. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQ:  I hope that we can have an interim report in some reasonable period of time.  Can we have any faith in the document we have right now?  Who the ITD has talked to? What time frames they used?  So we''d certainly appreciate your viewpoint. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA:  [There is a second person at the table who''s name I did not catch; I believe he is from the same office.]\r\n\r\nQ:  I thank you very much.\r\n\r\n7.  That completes our scheduled witnesses.  I had promised Mr. Quinn that he could return.\r\n\r\nQuinn:  Perhaps I should let sleeping dogs lie.\r\n\r\nPacheco: then thanks to all of you.  Let me tell you what happens next. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWe''ll be recontacting some of those that testified today, and getting written documents from them; we may be in touch with certain industry groups; we want to be in touch with the Auditors Office and the IT folks as this goes on; and we certainly want to stay in touch with the disability folks to hear how discussions are proceeding involving them. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nOne final comment that I would like to make on the record.  We have called this hearing not because of technology issues, because its not about that - we''ll get what we want at the end of the day.  We''ve called this hearing for a number of reasons:  One, we want to understand the statutory position.  We hear the ITD say they can move forward, period.  And we heard also that they cannot.  We have a problem. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe second point for the hearing:  process.  Keeping faith with what the open source community itself has put on the table each time we have talked to them - open process.  And from what we''ve heard today, we''ve had far less than democracy, when a policy could impact a large part of the workforce.  That''s far from a collaborative process.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finally, we called this meeting because of the potential costs.  We may go forward with an initiative, and we need to know what the costs and the impacts will be.  And we need to know what these impacts will be.  I thought that the Ways and Means Committee, on which I sit, surely would have had a discussion about this. And they first learned about it from me.  And I''ve also learned today that any cost analysis we have today is deficient. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo I''d like to say on the public record that our concerns have been born out in each of these three areas. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The meeting was adjourned by Senator Pacheco at 4:40 PM] <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The discussion considered what approaches made the most technical sense, could be completed most expeditiously, and would be most useful in accommodating those with disabilities.  Several subcommittees were identified that will be recommended to OASIS, with the hope that OASIS and its members will agree to move forward on these recommendations.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSince Friday''s meeting:  I''m told that the focus of these efforts will also be to ensure that the resulting standards will be harmonized on a global basis, and integrated at the public and private levels.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSeveral additional subcommittees not related to disability accommodation will also be recommended.   Patrick Gannon, CEO of OASIS, was present throughout the day, and many of the corporations represented at the meeting are OASIS member, so the recommendations were conveyed in real time.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i><b>- From the strategy breakout group: </b></i>  The strategy breakout group, predictably, covered a lot of ground.  One of the discussions that may have the most immediate concrete results involved the possibility of additional companies making patent non-assertion commitments, either identical or similar to the non-assertion pledge already made by Sun.  The effect would be not only to waive any actual patents claims that might be infringed, but also to augment the "aura" of ODF and signify determination among those committed to support ODF''s success. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, you may recall that while the meeting had not been publicized in advance, IDG got wind of it and Elizabeth Montalbano <a ref=''http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;771260862;fp;2;fpid;1''>posted a heads up</a>last Wednesday, based on a copy of the meeting invitation that came her way.  That invitation mentioned the possibility of a new organization being formed to promote ODF.  While that is still a matter of discussion rather than a binding commitment of those that attended the meeting, Bob Sutor, IBM''s Vice President of Standards and Open Source and the host of the Armonk meeting, has agreed to develop a proposal for forming a new organization to promote the implementation of ODF. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, a bit on the Massachusetts <b> Senate bill :</b> <br/></p>\r\n\r\nFirst, here''s a link to the full text of <a href=''http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/senate/st02/st02256.htm''>S 2256</a> (recall that Section 4 is the language in question).  I don''t know whether the fact that the language appears in the draft at the Massachusetts site indicates that it has been approved in the Senate version or not. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI''ve done a bit of asking around about bill sponsors, and apparently in our "transparent" system here in the Commonwealth the sponsors of amendments need not disclose their identity. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nRegarding <b>other sites:</b></p>\r\n\r\nOver at ZDNet, <b>David Berlind</b> has a <a href='' http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=2120''> very long piece </a>analyzing the October 31 Pacheco hearing at which State CIO Quinn and ITD General Counsel Linda Hamel testified.

David is appropriately outraged at the "hearing" and highlights some examples of exchanges that will be likely to elicit a similar reaction on your part. </b></p>\r\n\r\nDavid also takes a crack at trying to divine why the MS XML Reference Shema license isn''t <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=2125''>"open enough"</a> for Massahusetts, and brings Larry Rosen into the question.  He offers some ideas about how and where it falls short, but it would have been helpful if the Massachusetts ITD had been more specific on this point. </b></p>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the October 31 hearing, several frustrated ODF advocates that were denied the opportunity to provide affirmative testimony to Senator Pacheco brought written materials as handouts for those that attended.

After a month of news largely dominated by <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/oct05.php#trends''>pro-ODF announcements</a>, such as the release of ODF-compliant office suites, patent non-assertion pledges and the like, the opposition has just lowered the boom.  And if they are successful, it''s a big one. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAccording to what I''ve just learned, an amendment to a piece of important Massachusetts legislation was passed out of the Senate Ways & Means committee this afternoon the <i>[update: the amendment would be a new Section 4 to S2256 - an economic stimulus bill]</i>.  If it is adopted, it could at minimum drastically delay the effectiveness date of the ODF policy, and at worst, could roll back the Information and Technology Division''s (ITD) action entirely.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI can''t confirm at this time the identity of the amendment''s proponents, but I am told that the amendment will be debated in the State Senate on Thursday, so those who are behind the amendment will become visible at that point.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe gist of the amendment would be to create a new four-person "task force" that would have the power to approve or block a wide variety of IT policy decisions in the Commonwealth - and many provisions of the amendment map specifically to the ODF situation.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhat''s the motivation?  The most obvious conclusion would be that the industry opponents (or opponent, as the case may be) have allied with those in the state government that are already publicly angry about the ITD''s position that it can adopt a policy without the approval of other power centers in the State House (or at least that it can adopt a standard without "collaborating" with other powerful factions, the word repeatedly used by Senator Pacheco during the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1696''>October 31 hearing</a>).  The amendment also picks up on the ITD''s apparent failure to properly take into account the concerns of the disabled prior to advancing its policy to the point of adoption.   <br/></p>\r\n\r\nI''ve appended the full version of the amendment at the end of this blog entry, but in order to make the potential impact of the amendment -- and its attempt to blanket the ODF decision - clearer, I''ll also include the relevant portions now, putting those in bold and italics that are generally and precisely targeted at ODF:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 4....(a) There shall be a commonwealth information technology expert task force, hereinafter referred to as the task force, consisting of 4 members to be appointed by the governor, 1 member to be appointed by the treasurer, 1 member to be appointed by the state secretary, and 1 member to be appointed by the auditor. Of the members appointed by the governor, at least 1 shall be a representative of the business community with experience in the telecommunications industry, and at least 1 shall be a representative of the business community with experience in information technology...<br/>\r\n(b) The task force shall make recommendations concerning government\r\ninformation technology policy and practices...\r\n*            An <b> executive agency or department shall not adopt or implement a <i>policy, practice or standard </i> concerning information technology standards </b> or systems or the <b> procurement or use of hardware, <i>software </i>, and cellular phones and other electronic devices, without the affirmative approval of the task force by majority vote.</b> Any <b> executive agency or department <i>policy, practice or standard </i> concerning the creation, <i>storage or archiving of documents or materials </i> shall also be approved by the supervisor of public records and the records conservation board, and shall be certified by the state auditor as <i>maintaining or enhancing the commonwealth''s compliance with Section 508 of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1973 </i></b></blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo there you have it - an amendment that''s precisely targeted at achieving all of the ends that were outlined in the October 31 hearing: take the power to set standards away from the ITD, and hand it to a new uber group, as well as giving the supervisor of public records a veto as well. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut the amendment also takes another step that is rather Machiavellian.  Recall that the original sin of the ITD was, in the view of the ITD''s Statehouse opponents, to have failed to consult with the other branches of the government.  One of the parts that I ellipsed out solves that problem by making the only safe way that the ITD can ensure success in a standards decision is to involve the task force early in the process, by giving the CIO the right to "request" the recommendation of the task force.  That section reads in part as follows (once again I''ve added emphasis where appropriate): <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe chief information officer of the information technology division <i>may request the task force to provide recommendations or analysis </i>  on specific matters.... The task force recommendations shall address, but not be limited to, the following matters: (1) procurement policies by commonwealth agencies, constitutional offices, and other government entities concerning computer hardware and <i> software..., (2) format and content of web pages maintained by commonwealth agencies, constitutional offices, and other government entities; and (3) <i> software standards </i> governing commonwealth agencies, constitutional offices, and other government entities.  In offering recommendations, the task force''s analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the following considerations:...(3) the extent to which the proposed policy or practice results in user-friendly applications for commonwealth employees, business entities, and members of the public;...</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt might not be a stretch to say that this part of the amendment is intended not only to change the IT power structure, but to humiliate the ITD at the same time, by making it ask first what it can recommend before it makes a recommendation itself. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSo that''s where things lie for now.  The opposition has obviously been doing their homework well behind the scenes, and the game is now out in the open and afoot. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nIt will be an interesting and important debate on Thursday.  Stay tuned, and if you''re from Massachusetts, you might want to call or email your senator to let him or her know what you think. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nHere''s the full text of the proposed amendment: <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 4. Said chapter 7is hereby further amended by adding the following\r\nsection:-\r\nSection 57. (a) There shall be a commonwealth information technology expert\r\ntask force, hereinafter referred to as the task force, consisting of 4\r\nmembers to be appointed by the governor, 1 member to be appointed by the\r\ntreasurer, 1 member to be appointed by the state secretary, and 1 member to\r\nbe appointed by the auditor. Of the members appointed by the governor, at\r\nleast 1 shall be a representative of the business community with experience\r\nin the telecommunications industry, and at least 1 shall be a\r\nrepresentative of the business community with experience in information\r\ntechnology. Members of the task force shall be appointed for terms of 3\r\nyears or until a successor is appointed. Members shall be eligible to be\r\nreappointed and shall serve without compensation. A chairperson of the task\r\nforce shall be elected annually from the membership. An employee of the\r\ncommonwealth shall not be a member of the task force.\r\n(b) The task force shall make recommendations concerning government\r\ninformation technology policy and practices. The chief information officer\r\nof the information technology division may request the task force to\r\nprovide recommendations or analysis on specific matters.

And they had lots of company today, including Adobe, Corel, Computer Associates, Force 6 3, Google, Nokia, Novell, and RedHat, not to mention Peter Quinn, Massachusetts CIO, Patrick Gannon of OASIS, and folks from OSI, RedMonk, and yours truly (among others).  I''ll receive a full attendance list later today, but picked these up during the quick introductions at the beginning of the meeting.  In all, about 40 people were in attendance, including those from standards, technical, marketing, disability support and other disciplines. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting was historic also in the remarkable degree of unanimity of purpose displayed.  I sat through about four hours of plenary meetings, and three hours of the Business Strategy breakout group (the other two groups were Technical and Policy), and I can''t recall a single disagreement of note during the entire day. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finally, historic in that this was a time when you sensed that you could actually feel the world shift a bit from the old to the new, and that in the future, some things that seemed obvious in the paradigm you''ve lived your life in up to that point in time will never seem as obvious again. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were a number of notable decisions, some of which I''ll touch on briefly now, and some of which I''ll return to next week as events planned today are put into play.  Here is the quick list of those that I can talk about now: <br/></p>\r\n\r\n1.  Addressing the accessibility issue will be a major focus of events that will be announced shortly.  There has been a commitment made to not only close the gap between Microsoft Office and ODF by the Commonwealth''s deadline of January 1, 2007, but also to make ODF a superior alternative to Office for those with disabilities by that date, if not before.  Look for concrete details in press releases to follow. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n2.  Peter Quinn gave us a detailed briefing of the situation in Massachusetts.  He remains dedicated and determined to stay the course.  By day''s end, he had received the full and active support from all those in attendance to give him what he needs to respond convincingly to any and all critics. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n3.

[This amendment may have been debated yesterday in the Massachusetts Senate yesterday, so if you know what happened in that debate, by all means please add it in a comment below.] <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that I''ve heard Peter Quinn (the first time was when I interviewed  <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''> him and others</a> in connection with the September issue of the Consortium Standards Bulletin, which was <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php''> dedicated to the ODF battle </a> in Massachusetts, and he is one impressive guy.  He has a dry sense of humor and considerable drive and vision.  And while he may lead the IT department of a small state, that still means that he is responsible for keeping the systems running for an organization that is the equivalent of a Fortune 60 corporation.  If I were the CEO of such a corporation, he''d be the type of guy I''d like to have as my CIO.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nQuinn gave a whirlwind tour through the history of the Commonwealth''s IT department and its requirements, as well as a play by play account of the events that led up to the creation of the Information Technology Department (ITD)''s Enterprise Technical Requirements Model (ETRM) in general, and to the recent inclusion of the format restrictions announced in September. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nCentral to Quinn''s vision of the avenue to transition a vast, "one of everything" IT infrastructure to a streamlined, efficient model for the future is the realization that  the CIOs of today  too often focus on treating the symptom (the need to upgrade) rather than the disease (dependency on a single vendor that can tax you by forcing the upgrades to begin with).  In his view, we have all become "habituated" (in one of his frequent medical analogies) to the system that has ruled our lives for some twenty years now.  Quinn wants to break that dependency and lower costs by attacking the disease â€“ and ODF is one of the "silver bullets" he sees as instrumental to achieving such a cure.  <br/></p> \r\n\r\nOne reason that he feels confident that he''s on to something is that he has surveyed how state employees use their desktops, and what he sees is a great deal of document review but not much document creation; lots of browser use; and heavy email dependency, particularly as regards accessing and using documents.  In short, the typical Commonwealth employee has very little need for most features of a high-priced product like Microsoft Office.  Given open formats and more choices, there should be lower cost solutions that would be more than adequate, and which would not perpetuate current dependencies. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nWhile some have tried to portray Quinn as unduly smitten with open source, that is wide of the mark:  it''s open standards that he''s locked on, with open source being preferred when it makes sense, and proprietary solutions acceptable when no open source alternative is available.  And he is serious: <b><i> every</b></i> purchase by the ITD <b><i> must </b></i> support open standards.  And any new software purchase <b><i> must </b></i> be open source, unless he signs a "variance" to approve it â€“ not because every purchase must or should be open source, but because he wants to make sure that any available open source options have been properly evaluated.  In short, he''s one determined guy, who is going to do what it takes to get his department out of the past and into the future. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nRegarding the process of amending the ETRM, he realizes that he didn''t do all that he needed to in order to address accessibility concerns the right way, and is doing everything he can to rectify that situation (in fact, those advocates of the disabled community who gave testimony at Monday''s hearing called by Secretary Pacheco were complimentary of his recent efforts, although they were critical of his late start in addressing their concerns).  Specifically, he said that he thought that he had spoken to those in the disabled community that needed to be contacted, and that "he was wrong." [You can read my rough transcript of that hearing <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1696''>here</a>] <br/></p>\r\n\r\nHe also firmly believes that he operated consistently with applicable law, and that this conviction will eventually be borne out.  He believes that serious constitutional issues are at stake, and that it is therefore important that his department''s position be vindicated. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nAs to what will happen next, he says that if the current amendment offered in the Senate is adopted by that body, the focus for action should be the conference committee that will be formed to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the bill.  Presumably, that will happen soon, as there will be a 45 day recess of the Massachusetts legislature that will begin before Thanksgiving. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nUnless there is additional breaking news, I will likely focus on the technical discussions and recommendations from the OTD Summit in my next blog entry, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\n<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

They are as follows: Adobe, Apple, Computer Associates, Corel, Google, IBM, Intel, Nokia, Novell, Oracle, Red Hat, Scalix, and SIIA.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting was led by host heavyweights Bob Sutor, VP of Standards and Open Source, of IBM, and Hal Stern, Sun CTO and Simon Phipps, Sun Chief Open Source Officer. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociations:  CCIA, OASIS (including many individual members of the ODF Technical Committee), Open Office, and SSIA . <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividuals:  Sam Hiser, Adelstein-Hiser; Peter Quinn, Massachusetts CIO; Stephen O''Grady, RedMonk; Leon Shimer (consultant to the Mass. TDF); yours truly (Andrew Updegrove, Gesmer Updegrove/ConsortiumInfo.org). <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the <b> technical front,</b> Montalbano reports that: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe first subcommittee could come together in the next several weeks, to address any technical issues that could preclude OpenDocument''s use as a global standardâ€¦[It will address] making OpenDocument more suitable for applications that provide accessibility to computer software for disabled citizens. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general sentiment of those that attended (and what I expect to see, in more or less the following words in the press release that is currently being revised and cleared by the multiple corporate attendees) was as follows: <blockquote>\r\n \r\nThe assembled industry leaders committed to the creation of an\r\naccessibility subcommittee of the OASIS Standards Organization.  During a plenary session, a number of industry executives committed to  ensuring access for all regardless of age or ability, as well as advancing accessibility in both the ODF standard and supporting products.  Such advancements in accessibility in the global market will only be achieved through harmonization of global open standards. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis commitment was in response to a plea from Peter Quinn at the beginning of the meeting: that those who participate in the process of further evolving ODF and creating products that will support it, "Make the accessibility issue go away," something he can scarcely do on his own. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other OASIS subcommittees Bob mentioned by topic in the interview would enable "OpenDocument''s support of digital rights management, and another for how companies can ensure their applications are compliant with the standard." <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the <b>strategy front</b>, Montalbano quotes Stephen O''Grady, who attended on behalf of RedMonk, as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nIs this a competitive move? Absolutely. The [Office document] format is a control point for Microsoft and has been for years. OpenDocument gives more vendors a chance to participate and compete. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSome have wondered why so many companies that do not plan on offering office suite software would care so much about supporting ODF.  One answer to that was provided by one participant at the meeting that explains why there is something to be gained by all technology companies from the displacement of a dominant and pervasive product that controls monopoly pricing:  billions of dollars of IT budgets currently being spent on abnormally high office suite licensing fees could be redeployed to buy other products and services from the IT industry across the board.  <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSutor also confirmed in the interview what I reported <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1714''>two days ago:</a> that he is at work on a proposal to form a new organization, which he describes in the IDG interview as a " formal OpenDocument coalition."  He hopes to provide that proposal to the Armonk meeting attendees within "the next several weeks." <br/></p>\r\n\r\nPeter Quinn himself had suggested the value of such an organization in his presentation, suggesting that the "Open Format Freedom Fighters Forum" might be an apt <i> nom de guerre</i>. Unhappily, I expect that something a good deal more boring and less T-shirt appropriate will be selected if indeed the coalition comes to fruition. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe global theme plays through in other parts of the IDG article, as in this statement by Sutor: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this was not a meeting to convert anyone who might be an OpenDocument critic into being an advocate. This was very much a working group of like-minded people who think that what is going on with OpenDocument is a good thing. ... We want to make sure itâ€™s an extremely inclusive, global effort, not just in North America. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderlining the point, Sutor is about to leave on a trip that will include India and Denmark, to deliver the same message. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interview concludes with an evaluation by Stephen O''Grady''s of the efforts chances for success: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWith these sorts of multivendor efforts, it''s often difficult to sustain on an ongoing basis, and difficult to keep everyone on the same page and participating. But I think OpenDocument represents a significant opportunity for a number of vendors. I think itâ€™s in everybody''s best interest if the standards take hold, and I think that you will see significant accomplishments over time. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the <b>weeks ahead </b>, there should be a joint press release, followed by other interviews and announcements by individual company attendees, and the likely success of the industry effort to promote ODF will be gauged by what is said, by whom, and by who speaks up to support it. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n I''ll continue to provide context as these events occur, as well as news from the Massachusetts legislature, at least to the extent that our elected representatives deign to allow it to reach the ears of the citizens of the Commonwealth. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The article that continues to have the biggest audience, not surprisingly, was a long interview with <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/jun05.php#feature''>Tim Berners-Lee</a> on the prospects for the Semantic Web.  My principal thought contribution to that same issue was an effort to contrast the historical process of knowledge acquisition with the radically new synthesis enabled by the Web.  That article was called <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/jun05.php#trends''>The Web and the Advent of "SuperIntegration/Creation"</a>.  (The CSB is free, by the way.  All you need to do is fill in a few words  on the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscription form</a>). <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I suggested in that piece was that the process of acquiring knowledge as a society derives from the following: <blockquote> \r\nThe base dynamic was (and continues to be) the ability to build upon the <i><b> information, discoveries and ideas </i></b>that were acquired and developed by others, and particularly of those that have come before. This process depends upon the following steps: <p>\r\n<i><b>- Learning </i></b>something new (acquiring new information, and reaching new conclusions) <br/>\r\n<i><b>- sharing </i></b> the new information and discoveries (rather than hoarding it for personal advantage) <br/>\r\n<i><b>- Integrating </i></b>that information with other information and/or newly acquired information to a purpose <br/>\r\n<i><b>- Archiving </i></b> the information, in accurate form, for future generations <br/>\r\n<i><b>- Reacquiring </i></b>that archived information (i.e., knowing it exists and how to find it) <br/>\r\n<i><b>- Learning </i></b>something new as a result, and repeating the cycle </blockquote></blockquote>\r\nFrom this, I concluded: <blockquote>\r\nEach time there has been an important advancement in our ability to perform one (or more) of these process steps, there has been a commensurate advancement in our ability to build upon <i>information, discoveries and ideas </i>more productively and rapidly. </blockquote>\r\nI then gave examples of how developments in individual steps have had profound consequences (e.g, the acquisition of language enabled a quantum leap in the ability to share information, while the invention of writing not only allowed knowledge to be shared in a singled generation, but to be transported accurately over long distances and archived for future generations as well).  By the Renaissance, there had evolved a primitive version of the Internet and the Web, in that all scientists in the Western World were fluent in written Latin, and could therefore share and build upon each other''s ideas.  But the sharing process was extremely slow before the advent of telecommunications, and the evolution of thought was therefore more linear than neural. <br/></p>\r\nThe Internet and the Web, of course, changed all that, and enable what I called "SuperIntegration/Creation," a concept that I introduced as follows: <blockquote>\r\nI have purposely left integration until last, because it is at this level that the revolutionary aspect of the Web is most manifest, and at which historical labeling becomes inadequate, requiring a new term to describe what is happening in a multitude of new peer-to-peer, collaborative, on-line communities. Let us adopt â€œSuperIntegration/Creationâ€ as that term. SuperIntegration/Creation may be thought of as being simultaneously both a verb and a noun, and can be defined as follows: <blockquote>\r\n<i>The democratic, merit-based, neural, real-time, ongoing, evolving, sharing, integration and archiving of all information, discoveries and ideas that, on a Web-wide basis, represents our entire understanding of a subject at any point in time. </i></blockquote></blockquote>\r\nI''ll spare you the rest of the article, but here''s where we come back to ODF.  As I reviewed a selection of what the media and the blogs of the world had to offer on ODF this morning, I thought that selection presented a perfect example of the SuperIntegration/Creation process, whereby myriad views are being expressed, and significant events are occurring in a constant flood of data and perception, from which emerges the consensus upon which action and understanding evolve (which consensus, of course, continues to change). <br/></p>\r\nFor example.  At one end of the spectrum we have Microsoft, which obviously has a self-interest in avoiding wide adoption of ODF,  but also represents a more traditional way of thinking about how the IT infrastructure should be conceived and should evolve.  \r\nAnd at the other end, we see an interesting piece by John Udell titled <a href=''http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/11/09/46OPstrategic_1.html''>Beyond Office Document Formats</a>, in which Jon suggests that ODF itself is a traditionalist tool that represents archaic thinking.  Jon would like to leapfrog past formats to a world where the same issues ODF was created to resolve are addressed instead through more cutting edge means: <blockquote>\r\nBoth [Office and ODF] are conventional applications that, whether free or not, impose a heavy download, installation, and support burden on the people who use themâ€¦.The format debate also presumes an archaic mode of information exchange: e-mail attachments. We work this way because itâ€™s a habit our Web technologies donâ€™t yet enable us to break. Thereâ€™s no doubt in my mind, however, that online forms will continue to transform our means of gathering information, that hypertextual XML will make page-oriented technologies such as PDF obsolete as a means of publishing it, and that blogs, wikis, and their successors will become our primary means of collaborating around shared information. </blockquote>\r\nIn between these extremes, of course, there are a multitude of perceptions offered that have different entry points, and therefore their own discrete bits of wisdom that can be incorporated into the Noospheric understanding of <i>Where We Should Go Next</i>.  To give just one example, here''s a piece by Bernard Golden at SearchOpenSource.com, called <a href=''http://searchopensource.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1144104,00.html''>Golden''s Rules: The real story behind the Massachusetts ODF flap</a>.  Golden, like me, likes to look to the past for a context within which to guess the future, and offers the following, after asking how you and I should be thinking about the Microsoft vs. ODF face off and (impliedly) how much we should care about who win: <blockquote>\r\nWhat of the rest of us? When I think of this situation, I''m reminded of two words: Token Ring. Twenty years ago TCP/IP and Ethernet weren''t the obvious solution for networking as they are today. IBM, which had a default monopoly for computing, offered a complete technology solution based on its proprietary architectureâ€¦.What TCP/IP and Ethernet had going for them was that they were simple, open standards that anyone could create products for. We all know how the story turned out. The simple, cheap solution defeated the complex, expensive one, because organizations like to save money and implement infrastructures that are easy to manage. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBut there''s more to this story than cheap and simple beating expensive and complex -- and that''s why the ODF situation is important to everyone. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nBecause TCP/IP are simple, cheap standards, it meant that many players could innovate in many different places within the network infrastructureâ€¦.Without the victory of TCP/IP, things we take for granted today would never have been possible -- Ebay, Itunes, VoIP. None of them could have been price competitive enough to achieve adoption. And none of them could have been predicted at the time of the TCP/IP vs. Token Ring shootout. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, standardized file formats like ODF will enable applications and services we can''t predictâ€¦.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe excitement of our times, as illustrated by the current ODF conceptualization process, is that there are thousands, if not millions, of nodes (us) in this conceptualization process, all interacting in real time to imagine the future, and by acting on that imagining, literally make that future so â€“ an immeasurably strong force that even the marketing muscle of Microsoft cannot necessarily deflect, let alone stop. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nTo me, this process of SuperIntegration/Creation seems to be one of the most profound evolutionary steps in the history of knowledge and society.  Or, as I concluded in the article that I first described above:  <blockquote>\r\nPerhaps, this latest revolutionary leap in how we acquire knowledge, as with our acquisition of the gift of language so many millennia ago, may even change what it means to be a human being. </blockquote>\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

When the effort is superficial, bad things may happen.', 'This being a long weekend, there''s not much new information flowing into the marketplace on the ODF front.  But I did across an article that''s worth reviewing in detail, because it demonstrates how long a way there still is to go to educate the press about what the ODF issue is all about. With a crucial decision only days away in the Massachusetts legislature, who wins the hearts and minds of the decision makers will hinge in part on what is written in the same time period.</p>\r\n\r\nSpeaking generically, the problem is the evolved nature of the short deadline, short-text, on-line news piece that is so prevalent today.  Given those parameters, there is significant pressure exerted on the level of effort that is (and isn''t) spent on creating such ephemeral pieces of journalism.  True, articles that present detailed analysis usually follow current events in due course, but when events are moving quickly (as they are now in the Massachusetts legislature), there is no time to wait for such articles to be written.  Worse, serious technical articles are unlikely to reach legislators, while short pieces that help create "prevailing wisdom" may. </p>\r\n\r\nThe article in question was posted on Friday by Joab Jackson, of Government Computer News, and is titled <a href=''http://www.gcn.com/vol1_no1/daily-updates/37548-1.html''>Mass. reference model controversy over open formats </a>.  This partgicular article is notable because it appears at a site that presents news to the government CIO community.  How such a site tees up the ODF situation is therefore of greater significance than (say) what Fox.News chooses to offer (Fox, you may recall, not long ago aired a <a href=''http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,172063,00.html''>much-criticized </a> anti-ODF op/ed piece by a representative of an organization backed by Microsoft, without disclosing the potential bias of the author (James Prendergast). </p>\r\n\r\nLet''s see how Jackson updates his audience on the Massachusetts situation: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nSince its release last September, a technical reference model issued by Massachusetts has sparked considerable debate within the government technology communityâ€”and beyond. </p>\r\n\r\nAt stake is the issue of how active a role public offices should take in fostering open standards. Should an agency adopt a new open formatâ€”one that would better suit its goals but may prove more difficult to deploy and manage? Or should agencies follow the best practices of the commercial IT industry, taking full advantage of cost efficiencies and new features that may follow? </blockquote>\r\n\r\nJackson next points out some of the open format virtues of ODF: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe issue is especially pertinent when it comes to government records, which must be preserved for the ages. â€œDocuments are the lifeblood of the government,â€ said Dan Bricklin, IT consultant and Massachusetts resident who has been following the stateâ€™s actions....</p>\r\n\r\nOpenDocument is now undergoing the process of being ratified by the International Standards Organization, a global federation for validating standards. </p>\r\n\r\nâ€œEase of access to electronic records created in proprietary formats is limited in time. Once the proprietary vendor abandons a particular version of an application or format, documents created and formatted in those applications and formats may become inaccessible to all readers,â€ according to the frequently asked questions section of the state CIOâ€™s Web site. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nAfter reporting that Microsoft has not committed to supporting ODF, Jackson duly notes that there are several ODF compliant products from which Massachusetts may choose.  He then presents the opposing view towards the Massachusetts decision - fair enough, because that''s what a journalist should do: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are a lot of people who say the government is being harsh on Microsoft,â€ said Barry Murphy, an enterprise content management analyst for Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. Murphy spoke at the Storage to Knowledge conference held in October by PostNewsweek Tech Media, which publishes GCN. </p>\r\n\r\nâ€œMicrosoft Office is so pervasive, you wonder if it is realistic for Massachusetts to force people to learn a new technology and bring in another vendor,â€ Murphy said.</blockquote> \r\n\r\nNext, Jackson reports Microsoft''s view, as well as the XML alternative it offered to Massachusetts (the following are excerpts only): <blockquote>\r\n \r\nMicrosoft itself has voiced disapproval over the reference model "Essentially, what Massachusetts did was narrow their definition of openness pretty dramatically,â€ said Alan Yates, Microsoftâ€™s general manager of information worker business strategy. â€œWe feel it is unnecessary. It drives challenges, costs and problems that they really donâ€™t need to take on.â€ </p/>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Office 12, the next version of the productivity suite due out next year, saves documents in another open and royalty-free format, one based on the Extensible Markup Language. Microsoft has created an XML schema called MSXML that Office will use to format word processing documents, spreadsheets and presentation slides....</p>\r\n\r\nâ€œWe feel we have a format that is quite open for governments,â€ Yates said. â€œAny product could be built to use that format. This format is open now and will always be open. You canâ€™t go back and close it up....[Government users would] also enjoy the advanced features that Microsoft Office offers, such as Section 508 complianceâ€”a state requirement for IT tools." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nJackson closes out with some responses to Microsoft''s position: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThus far, the state CIOâ€™s office doesnâ€™t buy Microsoftâ€™s argument. The technical reference FAQ specifically stated that the office did not consider MSXML sufficiently open. </p>\r\n\r\nOther observers feel that following one vendorâ€™s lead may not be the correct way to develop a standard. â€œYouâ€™re trying to back into compatibility,â€ said Brain Stevens, chief technology office for Red Hat Inc. of Raleigh, N.C. OpenDocument was developed as a community standard, he said, one that allowed participants to â€œspecify openly what a document format should look like.â€ </p>\r\n\r\nâ€œThe open-standards format is about rallying around what an open standard should be. If you can build momentum, think about what you can achieve,â€ Stevens said. â€œIt is totally a disruptive force [but] it could level the playing field.â€ </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo how did Jackson do?  Superficially, he did all of the things that a journalist should do:  he interviewed knowledgeable people on both sides of the issue (although not Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn or anyone else from his department), and offered opposing statements on the points that he selected to write about. </p>\r\n\r\nBut on a closer look, this type of article isn''t what one would hope State CIOs (and legislators) would be reading this week.  Let''s go through the more important parts of the article one more time. </p>\r\n\r\nIn the opening, Jackson tees up the article by deciding which issues he wants to talk  about to frame the debate.  Recall that he stated as follows:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nAt stake is the issue of how active a role public offices should take in fostering open standards. Should an agency adopt a new open formatâ€”one that would better suit its goals but may prove more difficult to deploy and manage? Or should agencies follow the best practices of the commercial IT industry, taking full advantage of cost efficiencies and new features that may follow? </blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot the most neutral effort to tee the ODF debate up, as I see it, for the following reasons:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n- it focuses only on the short term, during which "deployment" will certainly be an issue, rather than the long term when benefits will begin to flow, and "management" could well be easier; <br/>\r\n- it assumes that usage of an open standard available in both proprietary and open source forms is inconsistent with the "best practices of the commercial IT industry." Such a characterization is at best selective and at worst indicative that the author doesn''t appreciate the values of these tools; <br/>\r\n- it again (at  best) focuses on short term "cost efficiencies" of continued use of Office, and (at worst) indicates a lack of familiarity with Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn''s assertion that substantial savings will follow from implementation of the ODF policy; <br/>\r\n- it similarly assumes that more features will follow from a single, dominant developer than from a community of developers competing to provide value added features in order to distinguish their various offerings. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nJackson does a bit better after this, laying out the pro and con positions in a neutral fashion, but again he is selective, presenting only Massachusetts'' concern with document preservation, and totally ignoring its other motives, including a commitment to support for open standards due to the benefits that will follow from that policy, a desire to use open source alternatives when appropriate (and therefore to prefer policies that may increase the likelihood that such alternatives may exist), and Quinn''s anticipation of significant economic savings in the future as a result of the implementation of the policy.</p>\r\n\r\nSome of the criticisms of ODF he chooses to include are also not very informative or convincing, such as this:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nâ€œMicrosoft Office is so pervasive, you wonder if it is realistic for Massachusetts to force people to learn a new technology and bring in another vendor,â€ Murphy said.</blockquote> \r\n\r\nWell, OK, but hiring anyone who isn''t pre-trained, or introducing any new product, involves the same issues, and that doesn''t stop any CIO from doing more than taking those factors, among many others, into consideration before making such a decision.</p>\r\n\r\nFinally, there are no conclusions at the end of the article, or any effort to gauge which opinions quoted are valid and which are not.  To be fair, this is a short news piece, rather than an analytical piece based on significant research, so while the absence is regrettable, it''s not situationally culpable.  Personally, I find the lack of appreciation for the importance and value of open standards in a technology writer to be surprising.  It doesn''t take research to draw obvious conclusions or to qualify statements made by sources to put them into proper perspective.</p>\r\n\r\nSo what''s the moral?  At minimum, that there''s still a lot of work to be done to get the word out to those who need to understand the issues better.  Unless those that help create the prevailing wisdom are made fully aware of all of the facts, ODF may not become a "safe" decision for an agency or State CIO to make.  </p>\r\n\r\nMaking sure that this doesn''t happen is important, because whether or not Peter Quinn is successful in carrying the day, if there are not more government adopters in the next six months, that will be cited as proof that Massachusetts, in fact, is not following "best practices" when it acts to support not just ODF, but to specify open standards-based and (when appropriate) open source products over proprietary, putatively "safe" products in its procurement activities as well. </p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Herewith, a sampling from the last 24 hours:  </p>\r\n\r\nFirst, in the <b> corporate position</b> department, there is news from <b>IBM</b>.  In furtherance of the meeting''s pledge to address <b>disability accessibility issues</b>, IBM was scheduled to announce today that its Workplace Managed Client productivity tools, including word processing, spreadsheet and presentation editors, are now planned to be <b>fully accessible on a Windows platform </b> by 2007, and on a <b>Linux platform </b>by 2008. As far as I can tell, Armonk meeting co-sponsor <b>Sun Microsystems</b> has not yet made any significant statements since the meeting, but if you have not yet read it, the statement it presented in print (but was not allowed to present as a witness) at the October 31 hearing called by Senator Pacheco can be found in full at <a href=''http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/31/Mass-Statement''>XML author Tim Bray''s Website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\nNext, on the <b>Massachusetts legislature</b> front, I am told by a different source that the Senate and House versions of S 2256 will be <b>reconciled by November 18</b>, which is faster than I had previously been led to believe.  Speaking as a resident of Massachusetts (but not one that''s paid much attention in the past to how such things work), I am appalled at how deliberately opaque those involved have made the system, and how little it''s possible to find out about the progress of "public" legislation.  Please, if you have any information on the schedule, sponsors, or current status of the Senate bill, add a comment below to let us all know (and send me an email, too, if you would).  </p> \r\n\r\nOne group that I  <b>failed to mention </b>in detail in my prior reports is the <a href=''http://opendocumentfellowship.org/Main/HomePage''>OpenDocument Fellowship </a>.  Ryan Singer, one of the founders, attended the meeting (as did co-founder Adam Moore), and volunteered to take a number of follow-up actions.  I received an email from Ryan today with a copy of a letter sent by the Fellowship to Senator Marc Pacheco, and a link later in the day from Adam.  You can find the letter, which addresses Pacheco''s concerns and also supplies links to materials that explain the concepts that the senator acknowledged he did not really understand <a href=''http://opendocumentfellowship.org/Press/2005-11-10''>here</a>.  You may also want to check out the <a href=''http://opendocumentfellowship.org/Main/CurrentActivities''>Activities</a> page, which includes a number of resources, including a list of Massachusetts legislators. </p>\r\n\r\nOn the topic of what <b> other states may do</b> CNET''s Martin LaMonica posted one of the <a href=''http://news.com.com/OpenDocument+format+gathers+steam/2100-7344_3-5942913.html?tag=nefd.lede''>most informative articles</a> I''ve seen about ODF in the last several weeks.  In this article, he interviews James Gallt, the National Association of State Chief Information Officers (as well as RedMonk''s Stephen O''Grady, another Armonk attendee, and Bob Sutor).  There''s a lot of detail in this article on a variety of current aspects of the ODF situation, so itâ€™s worth a read in full.  For now, however, here''s what Gallt and O''Grady had to say about where State CIO''s heads are at when it comes to ODF: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nJames Gallt,â€¦said Wednesday that there are a number of state agencies are exploring the use of the document format standardâ€¦."It''s more grassroots, starting small and working its way through individual states and agencies," Gallt said, but did not specify which governments were looking into it.  </p>\r\n\r\nThose state customers are seeking alternatives to Microsoft Office, while the technology providers are looking to loosen Microsoft''s grip on the desktop marketplace, said Stephen O''Grady, an analyst at RedMonk. Those factors are what are fueling the growing momentum for OpenDocument, he said. </p>\r\n\r\n"There''s a confluence of events," said O''Grady, who attended the ODF\r\nSummit. "You have customers like Massachusetts asking for choice and the ability to play vendors off each other, and at the same time, you have vendors looking at an opportunity to compete on a Microsoft control pointâ€¦.Office 12 is a very, very nice\r\npackage. If [Microsoft] were to support ODF, they''d do very well just competing on technical merits of applications. It''s very nice package. That''s the shame.  It doesn''t have to be an anti-Microsoft thing,." </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause OpenDocument-based products are not widely used, the financial\r\nincentive for corporate or governmental customers is still not thoroughly tested, analysts and industry executives said.\r\nNASCIO''s Gallt said that state governments are looking at whether\r\nMassachusetts can make the case that adopting OpenDocument will provide a compelling return on investmentâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nGallt said that the other states'' agencies exploring OpenDocument are doing so in a far more scaled-down and less visible way than Massachusetts. "It''s still, in a lot of ways, behind-the-scenes discussions and evaluations at this point, because it is such an emotional and volatile topic, as Massachusetts has found," he said. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo what''s the latest <b> internationally? </b>  LaMonica is on that as well, reporting:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe French state tax agency said Wednesday it intends to migrate 80,000\r\ndesktops next year from Microsoft Office 97 to OpenOffice, an open-source product that uses OpenDocument. The move will save about $34 million dollars, the agency''s chief technology officer told ZDNet UK. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo that''s all for now.  I''ll check in on my ODF agents later this evening, and add to this post if there''s anything else noteworthy to add. </p>\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Because they had the temerity to adopt a standards policy without first kissing the rings of the right members of the Commonwealth''s political elite.  </p>\r\n\r\nThat effort first manifested itself when State Senator Pacheco called a hearing on October 31 at which Quinn was questioned, and then confronted him with the testimony of a variety of critical witnesses (I posted a <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1696 ''>rough transcript</a> of that hearing here that night.).  Not long after, word came that an amendment had been introduced to an unrelated economic stimulus bill in the Massachusetts Senate that would totally emasculate the ITD''s power to set any kind of IT standards or procurement policy without the approval of a "task force" of <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1699''>political appointees</a></p>\r\n\r\nI''ve been trying to follow what''s been happening on Beacon Hill ever since, and it hasn''t been easy.  Apparently, some legislators in Massachusetts prefer not to make it difficult for the citizenry to know what''s going on until after it''s already gone down.  Repeatedly, I''ve been told by those that have called this office or that that no one will divulge simple facts such as who sponsored the amendment, and when it will be debated.  And some of the news that has circulated has been contradicted by other sources.  I reported on <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1729''>November 10</a>, for example, that I had been told that the House and Senate bills would likely be reconciled by November 18, 2005, which now appears to be inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\nOver the long weekend, though, I''ve received updates from two reliable sources about what is likely to happen (or, in this case, not happen) and when.  Here''s what they had to say. </p>\r\n\r\nThe first report comes through the able assistance of Pamela Jones, at Groklaw.net.  Pamela has not only been good enough to link to many of my posts on ODF, but has been providing her own unique perspective at Groklaw as well. I asked Pamela if any of her loyal band had any status information on the bill (S 2256), and today she sent me the following report from one of her readers: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nI attended the senate meeting on November 3, during which the amendment \r\n"COMMONWEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE" was adopted and got attached to the bill. This was the bill''s second reading. The amendment was sponsored by Senator Michael Morrissey, after being recommended to the Senate by the Ways and Means Committee. The chair of the Ways and Means Committee is Senator Therese Murray, whose name appeared as the original sponsor of the amendment. Senator Marc Pacheco, who seems to be behind most of this, also sits on the Ways and Means Committee. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don''t yet know whether or not the bill subsequently received its third and final reading for this stage of the process.  </p>\r\n\r\nThe second report comes from a public relations person that works for one of the corporate proponents of ODF.  They are also trying to follow what''s going to happen next, which would be to reconcile the Senate bill, which presumably now includes the amendment if the bill has had its third reading, with the House version, which does not.  I asked him what he new, and he replied as follows (the ellipses are in the original; I haven''t dropped anything):  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe are continuing to try and understand/evaluate the situation... right\r\nnow, I don''t know......our current information is that it is unlikely this issue will go to conference this calendar year.....that said, we''re tracking and where appropriate scheduling meetings with\r\nlegislators.....</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is largely borne out by the most recent edition of the Advances issued by the State House.  In summary, it notes that there are only three working days between now and when the legislature will adjourn for the balance of the year, and there are many, many major and minor bills already in various stages of action, as well as a number of scheduled hearings on other bills.  It also notes that no bill is in danger of being killed if it is not signed into law by year''s end, meaning that there is no reason for urgent action, at least from that perspective.  </p>\r\n\r\nHere''s what it says that is most directly relevant to ODF: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n  			   <center>ADVANCES â€“ WEEK OF NOV. 14, 2005<br>\r\n                         STATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE</center></p>\r\n\r\nSTATE HOUSE. BOSTON.This is just a three-day work week for Massachusetts lawmakers - but it may be the busiest and most important one of their legislative year.  â€œFormalâ€ sessions for 2005 end on Wednesday, Nov. 16 and thereâ€™s been lots of talk about what will or wonâ€™t be accomplished by that deadline.  But Wednesday does not present a make-or-break date for any of the major or minor bills still pending as this first year of a biennial draws to a close.  Every piece of legislation, save an appropriation bill or veto thereof, is carried over into the new year without losing any ground. And even if a pending supplemental budget is still in the works come next Thursday, it too can be carried forward into 2006 by way of a simple vote in each branch giving it continued life.  So the only possible damage come Thursday morning may be to the immediate hopes of interest groups pushing to stop or advance various bills and to the pride of leaders who may have predicted passage of one bill or another that will end up being delayed.   But while Wednesday is not a drop-dead deadline, the Legislature may act like it isâ€¦.\r\n\r\nIn the coming week, several major bills may well reach Romneyâ€™s desk, or attract his signature. [I''ve deleted the details on bills relating to energy efficiency, corporate capital gains tax reform, welfare reform and access to health insurance.]</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC STIMULUS â€“ CAPITAL SPENDING\r\nIt will take some hard and quick work in conference committee for the\r\nLegislature to merge two far-reaching and competing job creation bills into one this week.  The House last week named Reps. Bosley, DeLeo and Hill as its negotiators.  The Senate has not named its conferees.  A mid-year spending bill appropriating the remaining fiscal 2005 surplus also has a long way to go.  The Senate had planned to act on the bill last week, before it became riveted on the health insurance access legislation. Action on the â€œsupp,â€ as such supplemental budgets are known, is possible in the Senate this week. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nA variety of other bills are identified as being "less likely to move," including, intriguingly, "The perennial bill filed by Sen. Robert Hedlund (R-Weymouth) [which] would ban the appearance of apes, wild cats, bears, elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses" in traveling shows and circuses (that bill will rate a hearing this week, however.) </p>\r\n\r\nIf my second source''s sources (did you follow that?) are right, it appears unlikely that the economic stimulus bill will rise to the top of the action list and become law between now and the New Year â€“ unless, of course, there is maneuvering going on behind the scenes to push the stimulus bill to the top of the stack. </p>\r\n\r\nIn my view, it''s a good thing if the bill lies dormant for six weeks, because the quality of information that is in the marketplace and available to Massachusetts legislators is still sub-par (see my last blog entry, <a  href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1732''>demonstrating that conclusion</a>). And there could be further progress on the accessibility front before the legislature reconvenes, which would undercut one of the prime reasons given by opponents to try and reverse the ITD''s decision.</p>\r\n\r\nWhen the New Year does roll around, here''s the outline of the formal process that is supposed to ensue (the following is courtesy once again of Pamela''s contributor):  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAfter a bill takes its second reading, it is open to debate on \r\namendments and motions. Following debate, a vote is taken and if the \r\nbill receives a favorable vote by the membership, it is ordered to a \r\nthird reading and referred to the Committee on Bills in the Third \r\nReading. This amounts to preliminary approval of the bill in that branch.</p>\r\n\r\nThat committee examines technical points, as well as the legality and \r\nconstitutionality of the measure, and ensures that it does not duplicate or contradict existing law. The committee then issues a report and returns the bill to the House or Senate for its third reading. At that time, legislators can further debate and amend the bill. Following the third reading, the body votes on "passing the bill to be engrossed." </p>\r\n\r\nThe bill must then pass through three readings and engrossment in the \r\nsecond legislative branch. Should that occur, it is sent to the \r\nLegislative Engrossing Division where it is typed on special parchment \r\nin accordance with the General Laws. </p>\r\n\r\nA vote "to enact" the bill, first in the House and later in the Senate, \r\nis the final step in the passage of a bill by the legislature.\r\nFollowing enactment, the bill goes to the governor, who may sign the \r\nbill into law. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo there is where things stand as of this writing.  Hopefully the passage of extra time will increase the likelihood that the right decision will be made, not only with respect to ODF, but as regards technology policy in Massachusetts at large.  It will be a sad day if the legislature not only votes to create a task force able to  scuttle the ODF decision, but emasculates it''s own technology department into the bargain.</p>\r\n\r\nIf that happens, it will send a message to state CIOs everywhere that they buck the establishment, both political and commercial, at their peril. </p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

If you read my earlier rough transcript and were (how to say delicately) put off by the proceedings and the lack of understanding on Pacheco''s part of what (for example) the difference between an open standard and open source is, or the amount of FUD that had found its target, you''ll find this energizing reading. </p>\r\n\r\nFurther information on the contentions bandied about should come shortly, when Information Technology Division (ITD) General Counsel Linda Hamel''s <b>official rational for the ITD''s legal positions</b>, as requested by Senator Pacheco, is released.  I''m told that this could happen as early as today, although internal review may delay its release. </p>\r\n\r\nSome additional detail on the <b> technical front </b> comes in the form of a more  <a href=''http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/47672/''>detailed summary</a> of the technical breakout group at the November 4 Armonk meeting than I have previously seen available on line. This particular set of notes was taken by Nathaniel S Borenstein and represent his own summary of the topics discussed and the consensus conclusions reached, rather than a record approved by those present.</p>\r\n\r\nIn the <b> media</b> department, CIOToday.com posted an article by Elizabeth Millard on the Armonk meeting and subsequent events called <a href=''http://www.cio-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=03300000RSY6''>OpenDocument Format Gathers Momentum</a>.  The article is brief and doesn''t include anything new, but to Millard''s credit, she contacted Pamela Jones, and included this exchange: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nMany in the open-source community expect debates to rage for some time over ODF, because Microsoft is involved both behind the scenes and in its dealings with Massachusetts, noted Pamela Jones, who runs watchdog site Groklaw. </p>\r\n\r\n"With Microsoft involved, there''s going to be debate," she said. </p>\r\n\r\nBeyond the inclusion of Microsoft, ODF likely will keep up the lively discussions because it will be new to many users, and the impact on them will need to be considered, Jones added. </p>\r\n\r\nBut Jones and others feel that the meeting in Armonk shows promise for raising the level of the conversation. "[Sun''s] announcement is proof, to me, that Microsoft''s old business practices will sink their ship if they don''t improve," Jones noted on Groklaw. </blockquote> \r\n\r\nAnd speaking of <b> Microsoft</b>, we haven''t heard much from our friends in Redmond for a while, other than the occasional statement by Alan Yates when asked to comment in connection with an ODF story.  	As I''ve noted earlier (see, for example, <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1679''>Corel and Microsoft say Blah Blah, Woof Woof</a>, he has been remarkably brief and consistent in his statements, and I have not been able to detect any change in messaging for quite a while.  ComputerWorld interviewer Carol Silwa did ask <b>Steve Ballmer</b>, however, where Microsoft stands on ODF.  The interchange appears in a sidebar of an article not yet available at the ComputerWorld site titled, "Ballmer Looks to Change Users'' Views of Database."  It reads like this: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>Silwa:</b>Is there any chance you''ll support the Open Document Format, which the Massachusetts government''s IT division adopted as its standard? </p>\r\n\r\n<b> Ballmer:</b>We''ve announced support today for the PDF format, which is one of the interoperability formats the state of Massachusetts has indicated. We have our own formats for doing kind of bridge documents of our own styles. So I think that''s where our energies are focused right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>Silwa:</b> Never say never? </p>\r\n\r\n<b> Ballmer:</b>That''s where our energies are focused. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe article is datelined November 14, but as you may have picked up from Ballmer''s reference to adding support to PDF "today", the interview obviously did not take place recently. One assumes that Ballmer would be reading from the same file card today, however.</p>\r\n\r\nComputerworld, incidentally, has been doing what many media outlets have been doing: covering ODF solely as a "challenge to Microsoft" issue rather than addressing the independent virtues of an open standard format that becomes more and more useful the more it becomes supported.  If you''d like to perform a little test for yourself, do a word search on "Open Document" at the ComputerWorld site, and you''ll see that the second paragraph, if not the first, of every article tees up the Microsoft challenge story line.  True, the face off with Microsoft is part of the ODF story, but it''s not the whole story. </p>\r\n\r\nAnd, while we''re at it, in the <b>Big Surprise of the Day</b> department, I note that the Word spellchecker is set up to be sure that you spell Ballmer''s name correctly. Oh well.  At least Mr. Clippy didn''t jump out of the bushes and yell at me (does he remind anyone else of Doonesbury''s Mr. Butts?).</p>\r\n\r\nAll for now, but tomorrow''s another day. </p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

According to Parris:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nSeveral Christian Ministers and laymen from across the US and Britain have spoken out against Microsoft''s refusal to support OpenDocument, thus leaving visually-impaired users of their office suite effectively unable to use the new standard adopted by Massachusetts. The Christians see Microsoft''s stance as intentionally withholding support so that it can turn a technical business decision into a political fight. By refusing to support OpenDocument, Microsoft is ignoring the cross-platform document sharing needs of visually impaired users, not only in Massachusetts, but also in the other 49 states, not to mention the rest of the world.      </blockquote>\r\n\r\nLess plausibly, Parris argues, "The economically disadvantaged will also suffer from the lack of Opendocument support in Microsoft Office."  Presumably, those with limited means will find the OOo version more appealing, one would think.</p>\r\n\r\nIt never would have occurred to me to so ingeniously turn Microsoft''s decision so conveniently inside out, but then again, the Spirit moves in mysterious ways. </p>\r\n \r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Not only did it come from the expected sources, but also from inside the government itself.</p>\r\n\r\nAt first, the opposition from inside the government was styled as being about principle: whether Quinn''s Information Technology Division (ITD) had gone through proper channels to promulgate the rules that it wished to implement.  But today, any pretense of principle appears to have pretty much been abandoned, as the debate over an amendment to emasculate the ITD''s power to set prudent rules for the Commonwealth''s IT infrastructure degenerated into what looks like nothing more than a nasty little turf battle, Massachusetts style.</p>\r\n\r\nAs I reported here on November 2 in a post called <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1699''>The Fix is in on ODF</a>, various forces in the Massachusetts government decided to introduce an amendment to an unrelated piece of legislation that was conveniently close to adoption â€“ an economic stimulus bill called S 2256, which had already made its way through the House.  The amendment was intended to remove essentially all IT policy power from those that are in a position to recommend it best â€“ the Commonwealth''s own technology agency â€“ and convey it to a "task force" of political appointees. </p>\r\n\r\nOne of the known (but largely silent) enemies of the ODF proposal is Secretary of the Commonwealth William Francis Galvin, a very powerful person in the Massachusetts government, and a possible candidate for governor in the next election.  One of the departments of government that answers to the Secretary maintains the state archives, and the ODF policy obviously has some relevance to the archives.  Making rules that affected the archive without gaining the Secretary''s approval did not go unnoticed, or unappreciated (in the negative sense).  </p>\r\n\r\nThat brings us up to today, when a new amendment was introduced by <a href='' http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=BS022777&type=category&category=Abortion%20Issues''>Senator Michael W. Morrissey</a> in lieu of the amendment he had earlier submitted.  I am told by what I believe to be a reliable source that the swap was at the suggestion of Secretary Galvin, because the first version was "slanted too heavily in favor of the Governor."  And the new amendment?  It shifts power dramatically, and I bet you can guess in whose direction it shifts. </p>\r\n\r\nHere''s a summary of what the new amendment would do in contrast to the original: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n1) Reduces the number of appointees given to the Governor from 4 to 2 </p>\r\n\r\n2) Designates the CIO of ITD as a permanent appointee to the Task Force </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Eliminates the appointees by the State Treasurer and State Auditor </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Mandates that the Supervisor of Public Records (who reports to the\r\nSecretary of State) serve as Chair of the Task Force; previous version had the Chair elected by the appointees </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n5) Mandates that the State Archivist (also reports to the Secretary of\r\nState) serve as Secretary of the Task Force </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n6) Emphasizes that no agency, department or municipality shall adopt\r\ntechnology policy, practices or standards without a majority vote of the Task Force; previous version listed only executive branch agencies or departments as subject to the decisions of the Task Force </blockquote>\r\n\r\n[You can find the full text of the new amendment at the end of this post] </p>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, with the exception of making the state CIO a permanent member of a 7-person task force, all other changes solidly increase the power of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and even expand the power of the task force beyond that originally contemplated by the ITD''s proposal.  \r\n\r\n</p>In fact, the new amendment enables exactly the type of situation that the anti-ODF FUDists had claimed Quinn was out to require, but in fact was not: requiring that citizens of the Commonwealth could only interreleat with their own government if they owned software that supported a standard mandated by public officials.  Quinn never sought out to do that.  If the amendment becomes law, Galvin could.  Would that format be an open format, such as ODF, or a closed format, such as the one that barred victims from accessing crucial government sites in the wake of Katrina? </p>\r\n\r\nYou may recall that at the beginning of this entry, I said that the legislature had adjourned, as previously planned, for the rest of the year.  I''ve mentioned before that a breathing spell would allow extra information to enter the marketplace to beat back FUD, and perhaps enable a more responsible decision to be made by the legislature in the New Year. </p> \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even that may not be in the wings, since I''ve also learned that there is some potential  that the legislature may elect to reconvene in December to attend to unfinished business (I understand that it has not yet been decided, but may be determined on Thursday).  Thus, the stimulus bill, including this more far-reaching amendment, could yet become law this year.  </p>\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that timing has become a moot issue, since clearly larger forces are now at work:  IT policy has been identified as a politically valuable property, and that property is now in play.  We''re not talking about just ODF anymore, but political influence.  ODF was just the feature that brought the power into focus, and put control of that power into contention.  If it was Microsoft that first shone the spotlight on ODF, perhaps even that powerful company has now been relegated to spectator status while those in power in the Commonwealth duke it out.  </p>\r\n\r\nWill anyone push back on the new proposal?  Most logically, what of Governor Mitt Romney, at whose expense Secretary Galvin would augment his own power?  Maybe not.  There are many that think that Romney is vying to be the Republican candidate for President in 2008, which would mean that what goes on on Beacon Hill may be less important than how he plays his cards in a game with higher stakes.  Here''s what he had to say about ODF in a <a href='' http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml?articleId=174300106''> CRN story</a> by Paula Rooney released just today at 11:43 AM, and (tellingly) titled, " Mass. Gov Backs OpenDoc Policy But Distances Himself From Decision:" <blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nRomney praised [the ODF proposal]  as a good policy that is essential to ensuring citizens have free access to government documents in the future, but he distanced himself from the policy''s genesis. He gave credit for the idea to Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn and the Secretary of Administration and Finance. </p>\r\n\r\n"My CIO said the problem is we have a proprietary software storing all documents and down the road people might have to pay.  Our state decided on OpenDoc in the future, but we''re giving it time to be implemented ... it didn''t come from me, but from our technology people who came to me. Clearly Microsoft, IBM and Sun can format their technology [with OpenDoc]," the governor said. "Mine is a visionary job, but more often [the technology staff] come up with the idea."  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo it looks to me like the Governor may have decided that he has more to risk than to gain by fighting this battle. </p>\r\n\r\nWhich leaves ODF adrift. Where?  Sadly, in the middle of a nasty little Massachusetts-style turf battle.  </p>\r\n\r\nThat''s really too bad.  Because once upon a time, Peter Quinn, the CIO of Massachusetts,â€¦</p>\r\n\r\n<center>* * * * * * * </center></p>\r\n\r\n<center>RE-DRAFT OF FLOOR NUMBER 185 â€“ COMMONWEALTH <br/>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE </center></p>\r\nMr. Morrissey moves to amend the amendment, Floor Number 185, by striking the amendment out in its entirety, and inserting in place there of the following:-- </p>\r\nMr. Morrissey moves to amend the bill, Senate Bill No. 2256 by striking out Section 4 in its entirety, and inserting in place thereof the following:-- </p>\r\nSECTION 4.

The US remains in unilateral control. Status quo has been maintained with respect to technical functionality as well as regulatory power. While a multinational body, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) consisting of national governments, corporations and NGOs, has been created, this has â€œno oversight function and would not replace existing arrangements, mechanisms, institutions or organisations, but involve them and take advantage of their expertiseâ€. The forum â€œwould have no involvement in day-to-day or technical operationsâ€. Translated, the IGF will act like a scaled-up version of the typical Internet forum. It will allow frustrated users to rant and rave, or to offer useful suggestions. But these suggestions will not be binding.  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo it is that as details of the horse trading and next steps on Internet governance are finding their way into the media, each article manifests its own spin on what happened behind closed doors, and what will happen next. </p>\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere in its entirety, for example, is the official (and self-congratulatory) EU <a href=''http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/05/1433&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en''>press release</a> on the compromise, which claims credit for putting back together what it had helped to put asunder only a few weeks before at PrepCon3:  <blockquote> <center>\r\n\r\n<b>EU brokers deal on progressive internationalisation of Internet <br/>governance at Tunis World Summit </center></p></b>\r\n\r\nEU brokers deal on progressive internationalisation of Internet governance at Tunis World Summit </p>\r\nA worldwide political agreement providing for further internationalisation of Internet governance, and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end, was brokered at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis last night. The compromise text agreed was based largely on EU proposals presented in the discussions since June. As a first important element of the agreement, a new international Internet Governance Forum (IGF) will be created to deliberate among governments, the private sector and civil society at large in a multi-stakeholder policy dialogue related to Internet Governance. A first meeting of this Forum will be convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations by the second quarter of 2006 and take place in Greece. The texts agreed in Tunis also include language that will allow for enhanced cooperation among governments, on an equal footing, on public policy issues. Such cooperation should include the development of globally applicable principles on public policy issues associated with the coordination and management of critical Internet resources. This cooperation will make use of relevant international organisations. There was also a consensus in Tunis yesterday that countries should not be involved in decisions regarding another countryâ€™s Top Level Domain, thus meeting requests made, in particular, by the EU in the negotiations. </p>\r\n\r\nâ€œI welcome the texts now agreed in Tunis. They pave the way for a progressive internationalisation of Internet governanceâ€, commented Viviane Reding, EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media, who is leading the Commission delegation in Tunis. â€œThis agreement was possible because of the strong belief of all democratic nations that enhanced international cooperation is the best way to make progress towards guaranteeing the freedom of the Internet around the globe and also to enhance transparency and accountability in decisions affecting the architecture of the Web. The fact that the EU spoke with one voice in Tunis, and had stood by its case for more cooperation on Internet governance in the run-up to the summit, certainly strongly influenced this positive agreementâ€. </p>\r\n\r\nThe text finalised last night reflects a consensus of all participants of the Tunis summit. It will now be officially adopted by the Heads of State or Government, or their representatives, in the course of the World Summit on Information Society that officially starts today and will last until Friday. For the Commission, the days to come will focus on gaining the support of other nations for the EUâ€™s policy of investing in Information and Communication Technology, as a means to overcome the â€œdigital divideâ€. In addition, the Commission will reiterate its position on the need to safeguard human rights, and in particular freedom of speech, in order to build a truly global Information Society. </p> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs news continues to trickle out, I''ll report on it here, and will post the full text of the principles that were agreed to as well. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

How could the hundreds of press representatives there have found virtually nothing about open source worth reporting?', '<i>Updated 2005-11-21; 1:15 PM EST]</i> </p>\r\n\r\nFor the last two years, I''ve been keeping track of the UN sponsored, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) administered, World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process that held its first mass meeting in Geneva, Switzerland in December 2003.  The process culminated last week with a meeting of over 19,000 people in Tunis, Tunisia.  I was reading the final reports emanating from the conference over the last several days, a question occurred to me.  </p>\r\n\r\nWhat happened to open source?  </p>\r\n\r\nThis isn''t the first time that I''ve asked myself this question, either.  For the last four or five months, I''ve had a Google Alert in place to catch virtually every news story thatâ€™s been written on the WSIS process, in preparation for writing this month''s <i>Consortium Standards Bulletin</i>, which will focus on the impact, issues and results of WSIS.  Funny thing is, open source has never seemed to come up.</p>\r\n\r\nGiven that the entire conference is dedicated to questions such as how the "Digital Divide" between the first and the third world can be bridged, one would expect that open source software would focus significantly in the strategic planning, discussion and output.  If that isn''t true, that would be remarkable.  But if open source did play a role at Tunis,  the hordes of media in attendance at Tunis totally missed it, or didn''t find it worth reporting.  </p>\r\n\r\nIn truth, there is some history here, extending back to a preparatory meeting  in January 2003, at which the US <a href=''http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/01/15/030115hnwsisos_1.html''>opposed </a>a position paper that would indicate "support" for open source software.  But still, progress has  been made since then, even in the U.S. position.  </p>\r\n\r\nTrue, also, two stories dominated the coverage: the wrangle over who should "govern the Internet," which has provided political theatre for months (you can find an archive of many of these articles and a number of prior WSIS blog entries<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=25''>here)</a>, and the ironic choice of Tunisia (which has a record of imprisoning journalists and blocking Websites it finds objectionable) for a Summit that is substantially interested in topics such as free speech.  </p>\r\n\r\nSo how did open source fare at Tunis? </p>\r\n\r\nFirst, let''s run a search using Google News (which picks up only the last thirty days of material) to get a raw measure of where the media were focusing their attention.  A Google News search in English, by the way, picks up news stories from many nations around the world, by the way. <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWSIS â€“ 1,110 hits</p>\r\n\r\nWSIS + "open source" â€“ 37 hits </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHmm â€“ a bit over 3% of the articles made any mention of open source.  That''s kind of sparse in the mindshare department.  But in fact, its even than those numbers suggest.  For example, four of those hits relate to two accounts of a single speech that was reported and linked by two more, and ten relate to the big photo op of the Summit â€“MIT''s Nicholas Negroponte showcasing the $100 wind-up laptop that is intended to universalize access to the Web.  The open source tie in is that Negroponte intends (not surprisingly, given the target cost of a unit) to use only open source OS and application software. </p>\r\n\r\nBefore this sounds too bleak, however, let''s run that same Google search again, this time searching the entire Web, and throwing in "Tunis" to bias the search towards recent Web pages: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWSIS + Tunis â€“ 990,000 </p> \r\n\r\nWSIS + Tunis + "open source" â€“ 139,000</p> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nHmm again.  Now it''s 14%.  So clearly there is more activity going on out there involving open source and WSIS than the organized media is paying attention to.   </p>\r\n\r\nSo what did the mainstream media cover?  Let''s see. </p>\r\nAs noted, the biggest open source story out of WSIS (by hits) wasn''t really a WSIS story at all, but more of a photo op for a worthwhile project:  the $100 laptop alluded to above.  Even the U.S. State Department posted a story about it at its <a href=''http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2005&m=November&x=20051118165823btruevecer0.8199579&t=livefeeds/wf-latest.html''>public information site</a>, seeking to ride the goodwill coat tails of <a href=''http://laptop.media.mit.edu/faq.html''>One Laptop Per Child </a>, which is a  project of private sector organization, and not a governmental effort.  The Department of State story indicates that some in the Federal government are about as clear on the definition of open source as is Senator Pacheco in Massachusetts:  "[Negroponte] also said applications will be open-source based (run from a nonproprietary operating system), and available in "every single language that people want.â€ </p>\r\nNot surprisingly, the other articles on the same story are a bit more expansive (and accurate) on the open source aspects of the project, so you might want to check out one of the other pieces, such as that found in <a href=''http://www.techworld.com/mobility/news/index.cfm?NewsID=4815''>Techworld.uk</a>, which reports the same statement by Negroponte more comprehensibly: <blockquote>\r\nThe computer will run "Linux or some other open-source operating system," Negroponte said. Applications will also be open-source based, and available in "every single language that people want," Negroponte said. The MIT professor said he expects the open source community to jump at the opportunity to pitch in with this effort. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs may the proprietary world as well, it seems. Negroponte''s organization turned down an offer by Apple Computer to provide its operating system for free. </p>\r\nThe next most visible article (one link is from LinuxToday.com) is Jason Norwood-Young''s article in Tectonic.com ("Africa''s source for open source news"), and is titled <a href='' http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?id=714''>Open source on presidential agenda at WSIS</a>.  Still, this piece only summarizes the speeches of two Digital Divide speakers: South African President Thabo Mbeki and Hans van Ginkel, rector of the United Nations University, and doesn''t mention how the topics raised were actually addressed (if at all) by the 19,000 attendees. </p>\r\n\r\nThe next up in the Google search is a BBC.com article that captures more of the action, and is called <a href=''http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4450060.stm''>CDs and Comics offer Digital Aid</a> <blockquote>\r\nJostling on the sidelines of this week''s UN net summit in Tunis were dozens of projects that provide people in developing countries with much-needed hardware to get digital.  After a while in the haze and crowded floor of the summit''s ICT4All expo space, they start to blur into a colourful mass of e-learning, e-government and e-others.  Most of the grassroots projects rely on open-source software as a cheap, if not free, and adaptable resource.  Open software is seen as a crucial building block in the creation of a digital society in which everyone, anywhere, can share the knowledge, tools and opportunities that technologies can offer. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe two projects the article describes are a comic series used by a non-profit in Namibia to teach children about technology, and a way cool machine called the "Freedom Toaster:" <blockquote>\r\nThe large bright orange vending machine-shaped object looks rather like an internet access kioskâ€¦.The Freedom Toaster, a project run by the Shuttleworth Foundation, is a "bandwidth substitute". It requires no infrastructure, just an electricity supply. </p>\r\nIt borrows its name from the open-source community''s word for creating or burning a CD, known as "toasting".  Through a simple touch screen interface, it gives the digitally dispossessed in South Africa access to open-source software with free licences for those who might have a computer but no net accessâ€¦. </p>\r\nThere are now 30 machines installed in schools, libraries, science centres and retail outlets, and the response has been huge in the year it has been in action. </blockquote>\r\nLet''s see, after that we haveâ€¦nothing.  Yup, nothing but random passing references to open source in press releases and unrelated stories, out of 19,000 people discussing bridging the Digital Divide. </p>\r\nCould there really have been so little?  If not, how will we find out, without sifting through those 139,000 Google entries to find the occasional blog entry or internal report of an NGO?  And would there really be anything there if we looked? </p>\r\nPresumably, the answer to that is "yes," and that demonstrates a real issue for the open source movement and third-world issues.  Open source news is primarily a low-budget, Web-based phenomenon, that relies heavily on participant-journalism.  The system works very well to communicate and develop ideas, but it''s not so good when you need journalists with real travel budgets to get to the news.  If you don''t have that, 19,000 people can meet in a tent city in the North African desert, and any open source news worth reporting can disappear into a black hole. </p>  \r\n\r\nFor a sample of what the press missed, here is a speech Bruce Perens gave <a href='' http://perens.sourcelabs.com/''>Bruce Perens online Journal</a> at a WSIS event - accompanied by Richard Stallman in a tin-foil hat. </p>\r\n\r\nNow how did the press manage to miss that? </p>\r\n\r\n<i>Update:</i>  Here''s a story by Jon Blau of IDG News, called <a href=''http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1656186986;fp;16;fpid;0''>WSIS - Some open-source boosters see missed chance</a>, based in part on an interview with Richard Stallman.  It seems as if WSIS may have been an under-utilized opportunity, both by the governments that are already interested in open source - and perhaps by the open source community as well (my observation, not Richard''s).  </p>\r\n\r\nGranted, the United Nations isn''t the field open source advocates are used to playing on, but perhaps in the future, it may need to be.  Hundreds of NGOS and others gained credentials to participate in the WSIS process, as could any of the existing entities already actively working to advance the cause of open source. </p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

You can read the full story at <a href='' http://news.xinhuanet.com/it/2005-11/14/content_3776447.htm''>Xinhua.net</a> (that is, if you can read Mandarin).</p>\r\n\r\n<a href='' http://www.usito.org/index.pl/home''>USITO.org </a> represents the interests of five major technology associations (with a total of over 6,000 corporate members), as well as several hundred individual companies with extensive interests in China.   Each week, it summarizes significant technology news in a private email blast to its "members and friends."  The service is particularly helpful, given that it not only locates non-English technology language news from China and summarizes it, but provides context as well. </p>\r\n\r\nIn this case, USITO.org also reports that OSS and the China Software Industry Association (CSIA) hold "opposite attitudes on Linux."  In August, the CSIA apparently petitioned the Chinese government to give up what the CSIA regarded as an "excessive preference" for Linux, to the detriment of indigenous software companies, including (it claimed) even local Linux developers, who would be victimized by falling profit margins. </p>\r\n\r\nLu Shouqun and OSS have responded instead that the Linux industry in China is mature  and generating profits in much the same way that Western IT companies do â€“ by providing added services in addition to inexpensive distributions.  OSS is therefore pushing the government to continue to promote Linux. </p>\r\n\r\nNow, how familiar does that sound?

And the second, global, shoe just dropped today, as reported in a ComputerWorld story posted today aptly titled, and subtitled, <a href=''http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2005/0,4814,106437,00.html''>Microsoft to open Office document format: The move could spark a standards fight over document formats</a>\r\n. </p>\r\n\r\nLet''s get the facts out first, at least to the extent that they are available, based on initial industry articles and <a href=''http://pajamasmedia.com/newsml/html/2005/11/21/6456816_Microsoft_Offers.shtml''>Microsoft''s press release </a>.The key points are as follows: </p>\r\n\r\na) Microsoft claims to have lined up a number of heavy duty supporters, including Apple and Intel (each of which was at the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1705''>Armonk meeting</a> as an ODF supporter).  Apple even offered the following quote, atttributed to Philip Schiller, senior vice president of Worldwide Product\r\nMarketing, for use in the Microsoft press release:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nApple is pleased to support an Ecma standard for Microsoft Office Open\r\nXML document formats, which will make them more open and widely available to\r\nall.  Apple and Microsoft will continue to work closely together to deliver great products to Mac users and application developers for many years to come. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIntel''s Renee James, vice president and general manager of the\r\nSoftware and Solutions Group, in turn contributed the following vote of support: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe view Microsoft''s move to offer its widely deployed XML file formats\r\nfor Ecma standardization as a very important and positive step forward for the\r\nindustry. We are pleased to participate in the Ecma submission and documentation process, and believe our customers will benefit from better interoperability and systems integration.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe other members of the initial supporting troup are Barclays Capital, BP, the British Library, Essilor,  NextPage Inc., Statoil ASA and Toshiba</p>\r\n\r\nb)  Microsoft will offer its Office Open XML formats to Ecma International "early next month", a European IT standards body in Europe with a close relationship with ISO </p>\r\n\r\nc)  Alan Yates has said that the ECMA/ISO process would take "about a year" and would yield an ISO imprimatur by the time Office 12 ships.</p>\r\n\r\nd)  Microsoft will make specific licensing commitments to remove "virtually all barriers" that would prevent developers from working with the file formats. </p>\r\n\r\ne) Microsoft is wrapping itself in the Open flag (sample quote from Yates:  "We look forward to the day when people look at this as a milestone, as the beginning of the end for closed documents") </p>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft was meticulous in its preparations, even to the extent of gaining the commimtment of a prestigious library to back its formats, in an effort to offset the cachet of the U.S. Library of Congress'' support for ODF, and the fact that the Australian National Archive was a charter member of the OASIS ODF Technical Committee.  That library was none other than the British Library, which also offered the following supporting quote (attributed to Adam\r\nFarquhar, head of e-Architecture) to the Microsoft press release: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nJust as our predecessors stewarded the development of the national\r\npublished archive over the past 250 years, the British Library is committed to\r\npreserving and providing access to the U.K.''s digital heritage. We expect that\r\nestablishing Microsoft Office Open XML as an open standard will substantially\r\nenhance our ability to achieve this. It''s an important step forward for\r\ndigital preservation and will help us fulfill the British Library''s core\r\nresponsibility of making our digital collections accessible for generations to\r\ncome. </blockquote>\r\n \r\nMicrosoft chose Europe as the location for making its announcement.  As reported by <a href=''\r\nhttp://in.today.reuters.com/News/newsArticle.aspx?type=technologyNews&storyID=2005-11-22T065839Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-224542-1.xml''>Reuters</a>: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe move was announced in Europe, because "this is really a hotbed for standardisation efforts, and it is where people appreciate what we''re doing in greater detail," Yates added. </p>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has been in a long-running battle against antitrust sanctions imposed by the European Commission for abuse of its dominant Windows software. In March 2004, the European Union executive found Microsoft abused dominance of the Windows operating system so it could damage rival makers of work-group servers and media players.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBarclays Capital welcomed the move, because it could start mixing its massive amounts of financial and other data in different applications from many software vendors. "We won''t be trapped in Excel and Word," said Stephen Deakin, director for information technology at Barclays Capital, adding it may even strengthen the position of Microsoft Office.</p> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Reuters report also state that Yates indicated that "Government agencies, although not included in the initial list of supporters, were expected to endorse the move in coming days and weeks."</p> \r\n\r\nAnd while Yates in several articles mentioned the desire of government customers for an open format solution, the <a href=''http://news.ft.com/cms/s/e9f5c0f8-5ab7-11da-8628-0000779e2340.html''>FinancialTimes.com</a> juxtaposed Microsoft''s antitrust issues in Europe and its format decision as follows:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe move is separate to Microsoftâ€™s ongoing antitrust case with the European Commission, but comes in response to another concern raised by the European Union executive body. </p>\r\n\r\nThe Commission is eager to promote e-government services, but is concerned about access to public documents created in proprietary formats such as Microsoft Office. It is keen to ensure that all EU citizens are able to access electronic government documents without being obliged to buy a specific companyâ€™s software. </p>\r\n\r\nIt has been encouraging Microsoft and competitors such as Sun Microsystems and IBM to adopt open standards for office documents and ensure their products are interoperable. Sun and IBM took steps to open up their document formats last year, but Microsoft has been slow to respond. </p>\r\n\r\nHad Microsoft failed to act on the issue, the Commission could have stopped using Microsoft Office for the creation of public documents and advised all 25 national governments in the European Union to do the same. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what does this all mean (and not mean?)  The following observations and questions immediately pop to mind: </p>\r\n\r\n1. What''s promised today and delivered "a year from now" can be very different â€“ a distinction that may be lost (for example) on the Massachusetts legislature. On the other hand, ECMA has committed to work with Microsoft to accept the submission, and Jan van den Beld, secretary general of Ecma International, allowed himesefl to be quoted as follows in the Microsoft''s press release:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe are pleased that Microsoft and its partners are making this submission\r\nto Ecma International.  Our members around the globe pride themselves in their ability to drive progress and consensus on important technologies."</blockquote>\r\n\r\n2.  The OASIS ODF Format Standard has already been placed in the queau at ISO for approval, via the Publicly Available Specification (PAS) process.  Ecma may have committed to offer the Microsoft formats to ISO for adoption, but with ODF already in the protracted ballot stage at ISO, will the global body want to be bothered with a second, competing standard when it already (presumably) has endorsed a champion?  </p>\r\n\r\n3.  The Microsoft press release explicitly mention Word, Excel and Powerpoint -- but not the database or other components of Office.  Why not? </p>\r\n\r\n4.  ECMA and ISO have RAND policies that I believe would fall short of the bar set by Massachusetts.  An article by Martin LaMonica at <a href=''http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5965443.html''>ZDNet.com</a> records RedMonk''s Steve O''Grady''s opinion that Microsoft''s past performance in offering technology to ECMA leaves it "not clear that Microsoft will relinquish control of the Office formats to other companies." The most detailed information by far from the articles available as of this evening on the parameters of the license that Microsoft intends to provide can be found in the eWeek <a href=''http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1891829,00.asp''>article</a> by Peter Galli, which quotes Allan Yates as follows:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe new license that will accompany the Open XML format with the standards organization will go well beyond traditional standards licensing and will be very positive for the vast majority of developers, even open-source developers. We have gone further with this license, explicitly to widen the net for developers. Basically, it is a broad promise from Microsoft not to sue anyone for use of the formats. So that kind of broad, yet simple, promise from Microsoft will last well into the future and will appeal to all developers.  </p> \r\n\r\nThis would also make it easier for competing desktop application suites like Sun Microsystems Inc.''s branded StarOffice and Openoffice.org to be compatible with Office, he said. </p>\r\n\r\nThe license will be posted to the Office XML Web site on Wednesday, along with additional information about the submission to Ecma International. With regard to the competing Ecma-approved Open Document Format for Office Applications standard, Yates said Microsoft''s standard would differ. </p>\r\n\r\nYou have to understand that the Open Document group wrote their specification to satisfy a certain number of customer requirements, and we have done the same. We have had a very different and much more ambitious set of requirements to meet. So we are meeting the requirements of backwards compatibility with all of the billions of documents that are in previous Office versions [Yates said].</p> \r\n\r\nBut we are also focused on the forward functionality and representing all of them in Office 12, in XML, and we have the ability in that product to integrate directly the XML data from customers'' information systems into and out of our Office format," he said. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n5.  What''s the story on Apple and Intel?  Did Microsoft turn them after the meeting only a bit more than two weeks ago in Armonk, did they attend as Fifth Columnists, or were they still deciding which side to come down on?  I was there, and neither was vocal during the plenary sessions I attended (I don''t recall whether they either had a representative in the strategy breakout group, but if they did, s/he did not participate meaningfully). </p>\r\n\r\n6.  Speaking directly to Massachusetts (albeit not  by name), Allan Yates was quoted as follows in the eWeek article: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe move was important for customers who wanted greater control of the content and data in their documents, Yates said, enabling them to bring old documents forward into the open, XML-based future, improve business processes through the use of XML in documents, and give long-term storage and archival options for all those documents.... </p>\r\n\r\n"This move to standardization really gives them the confidence that they can move data around in the context of a document. So that is the ultimate goal that many of them are waking up to. This move also [affects] the billions of documents that customers already have out there and enables them to tap into this new level of functionality and enables many new scenarios around open documents," he said. </p> \r\n\r\nIt also would give customers the confidence that they could store documents in a format that would be long-lasting and even permanent, along with the promise that there would be many tools available to support the document use, he said, adding that customers would "not be reliant on one product or one version of a previous product from the past in order to open up those documents." </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n7.  And perhaps most tellingly, if Microsoft is willing to open its formats and to come up with the necessary converters to allow old documents to be upgraded, why not just support ODF?  What''s the advantage that will be maintained? </p>\r\n\r\nAt this point, there''s much more to be learned, and I''ll be watching the news as it becomes available.  You can look for this post to be updated tonight and tomorrow morning, with more posts to follow. </p>\r\n\r\n<center> * * * * * * * </p><b>\r\n\r\nText of Microsoft Press Release </b></center> </p>\r\n\r\nPARIS, Nov. 21, 2005 (PR Newswire delivered by Newstex) -- Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)\r\ntoday announced it will take steps to offer the file format technology behind\r\nbillions of documents to customers and the industry as an international\r\nstandard. Apple, Barclays Capital, BP, the British Library, Essilor, Intel\r\nCorporation, Microsoft, NextPage Inc., Statoil ASA and Toshiba will co-sponsor\r\na submission to Ecma International, the standards organization, of the\r\nMicrosoft(R) Office Open XML (Extensible Markup Language) document format\r\ntechnology. Furthermore, Microsoft will make available tools to enable old\r\ndocuments to capitalize on the open standard format. With Office document\r\nformats available as an open standard, customers will have even more\r\nconfidence in their ability to store and manage data for the long term, with\r\nmany more vendors and tools from which they can choose. The move will benefit\r\nthe broader software ecosystem because software and services vendors worldwide\r\nwill be able to more easily build compelling solutions that interoperate\r\nacross a broad spectrum of technologies.</p>\r\n\r\nThese global industry leaders have agreed to work together as part of an\r\nopen technical committee that Ecma members can join to standardize and fully\r\ndocument the Open XML formats for Word, Excel(R) and PowerPoint(R) from the\r\nnext generation of Office technologies, code-named Office "12," as an Ecma\r\nstandard, and to help maintain the evolution of the formats. The group will\r\nask Ecma to submit the results of their collaboration to the International\r\nOrganization for Standardization for approval.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWith thousands of documents created every minute in an Office format,\r\nMicrosoft''s Office formats are used in dramatic numbers. More than 300,000\r\ndevelopers have utilized the XML file formats in Office 2003 editions alone.\r\nThose documents will be able to take advantage of the benefits of the new open\r\nstandard, enabling document contents to be accessed, searched, used,\r\nintegrated and developed in new, innovative ways. Customers, technology\r\nproviders and developers around the globe will be able to work with the Open\r\nXML file formats without barriers, creating a broad ecosystem of products,\r\napplications and services that can work with the formats, with or without\r\nMicrosoft software. As a result, documents and public records can be archived,\r\nmaintained and maintained in perpetuity with long-term, widespread industry\r\nsupport.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"We are committed to open standards such as XML to provide the highest\r\nlevels of interoperability between legacy and next-generation software," said\r\nJean-Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft International. "The creation of\r\nan XML file format standard is a major industry milestone. We hope this will\r\nprovide both users and organizations with the peace of mind that they will be\r\nable to access their past and future documents for generations to come."</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"We are pleased that Microsoft and its partners are making this submission\r\nto Ecma International," said Jan van den Beld, secretary general of Ecma\r\nInternational. "Our members around the globe pride themselves in their ability\r\nto drive progress and consensus on important technologies."</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"Apple is pleased to support an Ecma standard for Microsoft Office Open\r\nXML document formats, which will make them more open and widely available to\r\nall," said Philip Schiller, senior vice president of Worldwide Product\r\nMarketing at Apple. "Apple and Microsoft will continue to work closely\r\ntogether to deliver great products to Mac users and application developers for\r\nmany years to come."</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"We view Microsoft''s move to offer its widely deployed XML file formats\r\nfor Ecma standardization as a very important and positive step forward for the\r\nindustry," said Renee James, vice president and general manager of the\r\nSoftware and Solutions Group at Intel. "We are pleased to participate in the\r\nEcma submission and documentation process, and believe our customers will\r\nbenefit from better interoperability and systems integration."</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"Just as our predecessors stewarded the development of the national\r\npublished archive over the past 250 years, the British Library is committed to\r\npreserving and providing access to the U.K.''s digital heritage," said Adam\r\nFarquhar, head of e-Architecture at the British Library. "We expect that\r\nestablishing Microsoft Office Open XML as an open standard will substantially\r\nenhance our ability to achieve this. It''s an important step forward for\r\ndigital preservation and will help us fulfill the British Library''s core\r\nresponsibility of making our digital collections accessible for generations to\r\ncome."</p>\r\n\r\n<center>* * * * * * * </p><b>\r\nOther Resources and Viewpoints</b>\r\n</center></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNextPage <a href=''http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/051121/lam121.html?.v=24''>press release</a></p>\r\n\r\nGroklaw.net entry and <a href =''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051121172833342''>extensive discussion thread</a></p>  \r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

I was able to get an advance copy, and here is a line by line legal analysis and comparison to the Sun covenant that supports ODF.  Sun''s wins by a mile.', '<center>[Note:  Footnote 3 to the Microsoft covenant was updated at 2:45 PM EDT on 11/23/05; see italicized text below]</center></p>\r\n\r\nI was able to get an advance copy of Microsoft''s covenant not to sue, so that I could provide an analysis of it as soon as it was posted by Microsoft at a <a href=''http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/covenant.mspx''>public Web page</a>.   Here it is, with footnotes indicating where my comments apply, followed by a comparison of the non-assertion pledge given by Sun to OASIS in favor of OpenDocument.  As you will see, there are significant differences: </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><b>Microsoft Covenant Regarding Office 2003 XML Reference Schemas</b></center></p>\r\nMicrosoft irrevocably covenants <b><i>(1)</i></b> that it will not seek to enforce any of its patent claims necessary to conform to the technical specifications for the Microsoft Office 2003 <b><i>(2)</i></b>  XML Reference Schemas posted at http://msdn.microsoft.com/office/understanding/xmloffice/default.aspx <b><i>(3)</i></b>  (the â€œSpecificationsâ€) against those conforming parts of software products. <b><i>(4)</i></b>    This covenant shall not apply with respect to any person or entity that asserts, threatens or seeks at any time to enforce a patent right or rights against Microsoft or any of its affiliates relating to any conforming implementation of the Specifications. <b><i>(5)</i></b> </p>\r\n\r\nThis statement is not an assurance either (i) that any of Microsoft''s issued patent claims cover a conforming implementation of the Specifications or are enforceable, or (ii) that such an implementation would not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of any third party. <b><i>(6)</i></b> </p>\r\n\r\nNo other rights except those expressly stated in this covenant shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, or estoppel, <b><i>(7)</i></b> or otherwise. In particular, no rights in the Microsoft Office product, including its features and capabilities, are hereby granted except as expressly set forth in the Specifications.</p>\r\n\r\n(1)	From a legal perspective, the question is whether such a statement, made at a website, is binding on the party that makes it.  The answer to that would be rather complex, uncertain, and untested.  Note that the same issue arises with similar pledges made by Sun and IBM, so this is not unique to Microsoft, with one exception:  Sun has made its commitment to OASIS under the OASIS IPR policy, backed by the member contract that Sun entered into with OASIS.  If adoption follows with Ecma, as Microsoft hopes, it will be important for Microsoft to make the same pledge to Ecma in a legally binding fashion.  I''ll return to this issue later. </p>\r\n(2)	While referring to the specifications at the Website is helpful in one sense, it is a risk in another sense, as that Webpage is completely under the control of Microsoft, which can change it any time, and as often as it wishes.  Thus, until Ecma adopts the formats as a standard, Microsoft can do whatever it wishes, and implementers would need to follow, in order to maintain current compatibility, even if the formats go in a direction they don''t like.  Nor will they have advance warning, presumably, of such a change.  Or, Microsoft could add new functionalities to its own Office products that lie outside the current formats, and not include them in the covenant, giving it an advantage over competitors.  Note also that Ecma and its members could request changes to the formats.  The net result is that implementing under the covenant will be risky under this language as written until (a) Ecma adopts the standard, assuming that happens, (b) Microsoft enters into a better version of this language in a binding agreement with Ecma (even though this covenant is more stringent than Ecma''s own rules would require, and therefore Microsoft would be doing so voluntarily), and (c) Microsoft makes some sort of ongoing commitment to renew its covenant with each new release, to the extent necessary.</p>\r\n(3)	It is very significant that the pledge, while "irrevocable," is identified to the 2003 XML Reference Schemas as posted.  In order for this covenant to be truly useful, the pledge should extend to all future versions of the Schemas, especially if they are adopted by Ecma and blessed by ISO.  Otherwise, the covenant is a dead end.<i></p>\r\n[It has been pointed out to me that a statement on the Microsoft Web page that <a href=''http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/newvsold.mspx''>compares </a>the new covenant with the prior license for the 2003 XML Reference Schemas includes the following statement:<blockquote> "Microsoft will also be offering this same covenant with respect to the forthcoming specifications for the "Office 12" schema specifications."  </blockquote>From a purely legal perspective, it would be desirable to refer to those specifications in the language of the current covenant, but it is reasuring to see that Microsoft has made a public commitment to offer the same commitment for the Office 12 specifications.]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n(4)	As with every other type of standard, this type of statement can be tricky.  While it is the norm to make an intellectual property rights (IPR) commitment only as to what is essential to be used in order to implement the "required portions of the specification," it may be that there are features, capabilities, or other aspects or code that anyone would want to be able to use on the same free basis if they were going to implement the specification itself.  I do not know whether that is an issue in this instance.</p>\r\n(5)	This is what is often referred to as a "defensive suspension" term, and is neither unusual nor deemed to be unfair.  The concept is that someone offering their IPR to the industry for free is entitled to a level litigation playing field if someone turns around and sues them for implementing the same specification.  Note that this right only applies when Microsoft or one of its affiliates is threatened.</p>\r\n(6)	This is standard "lawyer talk," and makes us feel better (especially those that work in large corporations that feel like litigation-magnets). </p>\r\n(7)	"Estoppel" is a legal doctrine akin to entrapment.  In the Rambus litigation, for example, estoppel was raised as a defense by some defendants, who said that Rambus could have spoken up, but didn''t, thereby leading them to incur liabilities that could have been avoided if Rambus had been upfront about its IPR.  Interestingly enough, for the same reason that implementers might feel nervous about the point that I made in footnote (1), Microsoft may not get much value out of this, since there will be no signed contract between Microsoft and the implementer.</p>\r\n\r\nNow let''s see how the <a href=''http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/ipr.php''>Sun covenant </a>compares: </p>\r\n\r\n<center><b>Sun OpenDocument Patent Statement to OASIS</b></center></p>\r\n\r\nSun irrevocably covenants that, subject solely to the reciprocity requirement described below, <b><i>(1)</i></b> it will not seek to enforce any of its enforceable <b><i>(2)</i></b>  U.S. or foreign patents against any implementation of the Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0 Specification, or of any subsequent version thereof ("OpenDocument Implementation")<b><i>(3)</i></b>  in which development Sun participates to the point of incurring an obligation, as defined by the rules of OASIS, to grant (or commit to grant) patent licenses or make equivalent non-assertion covenants. <b><i>(4)</i></b> Notwithstanding the commitment above, Sun''s covenant shall not apply and Sun makes no assurance, covenant or commitment not to assert or enforce any or all of its patent rights against any individual, corporation or other entity that asserts, threatens or seeks at any time to enforce its own or another party''s U.S. or foreign patents or patent rights against any OpenDocument Implementation. <b><i>(5)</i></b> </p>\r\nThis statement is not an assurance either (i) that any of Sun''s issued patents cover an OpenDocument Implementation or are enforceable, or (ii) that an OpenDocument Implementation would not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of any third party. <b><i>(6)</i></b> </p>\r\nNo other rights except those expressly stated in this Patent Statement shall be deemed granted, waived, or received by implication, or estoppel, or otherwise. <b><i>(7)</i></b>  </p>\r\nSimilarly, nothing in this statement is intended to relieve Sun of its obligations, if any, under the applicable rules of OASIS. <b><i>(8)</i></b> </p>\r\nHere''s how the Sun covenant measures up: </p>\r\n\r\n(1)	This correlates to my footnote 6 to the Microsoft covenant, but see my comments in footnote 5 below for an important distinction between the two covenants. </p>\r\n\r\n(2)	Only lawyers that live on the other side of the looking glass could make a statement like this.  Sun reserves the right to enforce its <i>unenforceable</i> patents?  I can''t guess why this is in here, but I think it washes out, since by definition, if you were sued by Sun, you need simply point out to the court that the suit was, by definition, groundless. </p>\r\n\r\n(3)	Sun here makes the commitment that I note is not made by Microsoft in my footnotes 2 and 3 above.  Note also that the version of the specification to which the covenant applies is on the OASIS Web site, and is therefore not under Sun''s control. </p>\r\n\r\n(4)	What this means under the current OASIS IPR policy is that if Sun is part of the process that creates the next version of ODF, it will renew the pledge as respects the new version.  If it quits OASIS, or chooses not to participate in the next version, then it''s commitment would continue to the existing version, and to those parts of the first version that persist into the new version, but not as to any new material that may be added.  Presumably one reason this may have been added is so that if (for example) the members of the revision Technical Committee wished to add a description of a Sun proprietary product to ODF that was not there before, Sun could drop out if it was unwilling to contribute that feature.  Of course, by doing so, it would also lose the ability to influence the further evolution of ODF, so there is an offsetting incentive (although not a guaranty) for its continuing participation. </p>\r\n\r\n(5)	This defensive revocation right mirrors that of Microsoft, as noted in my footnote 6 above, but with one important exception:  while Microsoft has reserved the right to protect itself, Sun has reserved the right, if it wishes, to be a "patent policeman" that could assist <i>any</i> implementer of ODF. </p>\r\n\r\n(6)	See footnote 6 above.  The same comments apply here. </p>\r\n\r\n(7)	See footnote 7 above.  Again, the same comments apply here. </p>\r\n\r\n(8)	This language supplies another layer of protection, secured by Sun''s membership agreement contract, not present in the Microsoft covenant.  Ecma adoption may provide equivalent protection if it adopts the Microsoft formats. </p>\r\nIt is important to note that both of these covenants suffer from a common failing, which is that, as between the patent owner (Microsoft or Sun) and an actual implementer, there is no well-funded White Knight to swoop in to defend the small ISV.  Similarly, there is no commitment to make the same covenant binding on someone that might buy the patent (the same problem relates to standards generally). </p>\r\nThe upshot is that the Sun covenant is far superior in several important respects to the Microsoft pledge.  </p>\r\nThis raises the question: Why?  Certainly, Microsoft must have expected that a comparative analysis like this would be done almost immediately, so it must have had a strong incentive to match the Sun covenant as closely as possible, and it decided not to.  Again: Why? </p>\r\nThere are three possibilities.  The first is that it has evil entrapment plans afoot, but I really don''t think that is likely to be the case, and certainly not in each instance, since it would be rightly pilloried for doing so.  The second is that it hasn''t gotten far enough through the knothole to bring itself to go as far as Sun did. </p>\r\nThe third is that it has made the calculated decision that this is as far as it needs to go to obtain the objective that it is trying to achieve, which is to head off ODF at the pass. </p>\r\nWhich is it?  My guess is that it''s a combination of 2 and 3.  I''m told by those I know in Microsoft that making such a covenant was a difficult and contentious decision internally, and it would be tough to sell internally more than the absolute minimum necessary to arguably do the job. </p>\r\nWill it be enough?  We''ll find out.  But on my review, there''s a lot of light standing between the two covenants which will provide plenty for people to talk about.  Microsoft knows its customers well, though, and itâ€™s the customers ultimately that will say whether Microsoft bet its hand conservatively and still won, or didn''t act boldly enough to walk away with the pot.  </p>\r\nGiven that Microsoft has already collected some endorsements from European governments in favor of its formats, backed by the Ecma announcement (its not coincidence that Ecma is a European standards developer), its clear that its already test marketed its bid with its customers. </p>\r\nThe bid now passes across the table.  Who''s going to make the next bet?  </p>\r\n\r\n<i><b>Note: </b>This entry does not constitute the rendering of legal advice; please consult your own attorney before making any decisions involving Microsoft''s intellectual property rights.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

It''s still far too early to say that the dust has settled, but I''ll attempt to pull together here the most significant pieces of information that I''ve located since last night''s post, and what it all means.</p>\r\n\r\nLet''s start with what <b>Microsoft</b> is saying.  Starting with the official resources, here is the address for Microsoft''s <i>PressPass</i> <a href='' http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/nov05/11-21Ecma.mspx ''>page for journalists</a> tracking the story.  There''s a long Q&A there that is notable primarily for the degree of technical detail that''s included.  Your guide for much of the technical tour will be <b>Jean Paoli</b>, Microsoft''s senior director of XML architecture, who is the subject of an in-house interview. Watch for more material to show up at this page in the days ahead. </p>\r\n\r\nThe hitherto taciturn <b>Alan Yates </b>, who has been the principal spokesperson for Microsoft regarding ODF has done more talking for attribution in the past 24 hours, by several orders of magnitude, than I''ve read from him on line over the past three months.  Thus, if you cull through the (currently) 74 "all related stories" at Google News in response to an "Ecma + Microsoft" search, you''ll find many articles that are simply rehashes of the Microsoft press release, but others in which Yates answers different questions and reveals something new.  I''ll highlight some examples below.</p>\r\n\r\nReturning to the <b>technical front</b>, there is another <a href='' http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/21/microsoft-to-standardize-office-formats-jean-paoli-interview/''>interview of Microsoft''s Jean Paoli</a>, which includes enlightening exchanges such as the following: <blockquote> \r\n<b>Q: </b>How do I know that there isnâ€™t some sort of hidden Microsoft agenda?</p>\r\n<b>Jean Paoli:</b> The only agenda is widespread support for the Office Open XML formats. It takes more than Microsoft to really win the trust of millions of customers for a standard technology.</p> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nMore significantly, Paoli mentions in passing that the dialogue with Ecma has been going on since the Spring â€“ meaning that Microsoft has been hedging its bets for quite a while. </p>\r\n\r\nJason Matusow is another Microsoft employee that has a <a href='' http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonmatusow/archive/2005/11/21/495497.aspx''>website</a>, and has something to say about the format announcement.   Matusow''s post is best read in juxtaposition with  Steve Walli''s <a href='' http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2005/11/microsoft_to_st.html ''>excellent commentary</a> on the announcement (Steve, a former Microsoft employee, knows whereof he speaks, and of whom he is speaking).  He introduces Jason and his blogpost as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting Microsoft commentaries is from Jason Matusow (Microsoft Shared Source maven) . It''s good that he''s getting his opinions in order. Jason is a master of rhetoric, a brilliant presenter, and a glutton for punishment as the man from Microsoft that gets to present world-wide on Microsoft''s open source and Shared Source strategies. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSteve addresses Matusow''s contentions, along with most of the other Microsoft sources noted above and below, in the context of what is being promised, and has been promised in prior, similar situations. </p>\r\n\r\nAnd finally, before leaving Microsoft to look at other sources, there is <a href='' http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/11/21/495466.aspx''>Brian Jones'' Blog</a>.  Jones'' long post is notable for its information on the covenant not to sue that Microsoft has promised will accompany its offer of its formats to Ecma and ISO.  In part, he says: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn addition to this move towards standardization, we are also going to make some changes to our licensing approach. I''ve definitely heard the concern from folks over the past few months around the licenses. We want to make this issue much simpler as well as address the core concern, which was that some folks thought we might somehow sue people for using the formats. Obviously we don''t want anyone to have that concern, so in order to clear up any other uncertainties related to how and where you can use our formats, we are moving away from our royalty free license, and instead we are going to provide a very simple and general statement that we make an irrevocable commitment not to sue. I''m not a lawyer, but from what I can see, this "covenant not to sue" looks like it should clear the way for GPL development which was a concern for some folks.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are, not surprisingly, a lot of comments from gentle readers at Jones'' site, and he has been good enough to answer some of the questions posed, so this is again a site to monitor for further information.  Specifically, he stated last night that he would post the text of  the licensing commitment Monday night or this morning â€“ Microsoft has not promised to post it at its own site until Wednesday (as of this writing, Jones has not yet posted the language, but I''ll update this post if he does). </p>\r\n\r\nSo what do we know so far about the specifics of the promised<b> covenant not to sue</b>?  The most <a href='' http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/249242_msftopen22.html ''>interesting description</a> comes once again from Alan Yates, in an interview to a <i>Boston Globe</i> reporter.  There, he says in part: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe new license that will accompany the Open XML format with the standards organization will go well beyond traditional standards licensing and will be very positive for the vast majority of developers, even open-source developers," he said. \r\n</p>\r\n"We have gone further with this license, explicitly to widen the net for developers. Basically, it is a broad promise from Microsoft not to sue anyone for use of the formats. So that kind of broad, yet simple, promise from Microsoft will last well into the future and will appeal to all developers," Yates said. </p>\r\n\r\nThis would also make it easier for competing desktop application suites like Sun Microsystems Inc.''s branded StarOffice and Openoffice.org to be compatible with Office, he said. </p>\r\n\r\nThe license will be posted to the <a href='' http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/default.mspx''> Office XML Web site </a>on Wednesday, along with additional information about the submission to Ecma International. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat does Yates'' statement that the terms will be "very positive for the <i> vast majority</i> of developers portend?  Interesting question, and supposedly we won''t have long to wait to find out.  Other statements of note: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the competing Ecma-approved Open Document Format for Office Applications standard, Yates said Microsoft''s standard would differ. \r\n"You have to understand that the Open Document group wrote their specification to satisfy a certain number of customer requirements, and we have done the same. We have had a very different and much more ambitious set of requirements to meet. So we are meeting the requirements of backwards compatibility with all of the billions of documents that are in previous Office versions," he said. </p>\r\n\r\nIt also would give customers the confidence that they could store documents in a format that would be long-lasting and even permanent, along with the promise that there would be many tools available to support the document use, he said, adding that customers would "not be reliant on one product or one version of a previous product from the past in order to open up those documents."  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhich provides an apt segue to the question of <b> What does this mean for Massachusetts?</b>  It appears that Microsoft''s behind the scenes messaging has been quite effective, as noted in this section of the same article: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n[S]tate Sen. Marc Pacheco said the state should consider adopting Microsoft''s Open XML along with OpenDocument if the company''s format is certified by Ecma. "If you have a product that''s going to be accepted in the international community, and they still exclude it here, then it''s really about restricting Microsoft and not about open standards," Pacheco said. </p>\r\nThe senator said Microsoft Office has features that make it accessible to visually impaired state workers, and he was concerned that abandoning Office would make it harder for people with disabilities to access state records and documents. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are three sad features of this statement.  First, Pacheco has freely admitted in the past that he doesn''t really <a href='' http://consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1696''>understand</a> what standards are all about, so (not surprisingly) one standard should be as good as the next, right? In fact, Yates had this to say to the <i>Globe</i> about whether the Microsoft formats â€“ and the covenant not to sue - should pass muster with the Massachusetts Information Technology Division:<blockquote>\r\nYates said Open XML is in the spirit of the Massachusetts initiative, although he conceded that it still "doesn''t meet the explicit policy" of the state that recognizes OpenDocument as its standard.</blockquote>\r\n The second is that (a) ISO adoption is at least a year away, (b) Ecma, and then ISO, adoption cannot be assumed, and (c) even if it is, no one knows yet how much the formats will be used, and by whom.  In short, if one were to resurrect the original objections Microsoft raised to ODF, many of them could play back with equal validity to counter what Microsoft is now saying about its own formats. </p>\r\nAnd finally, while the ODF community has committed to meet - and surpass - Office in terms of accessibility, there is no statement anywhere from Microsoft that I could locate addressing accessibility issues and the Microsoft formats.  As poignantly asked by one visitor to Brian Jones'' site:  <blockquote>\r\nWhat steps have MS taken with regard to the Office XML file formats in \r\nrelation to accessibility? I''m not referring to the Office Apps. \r\nthemselves, I''m only too familiar with how a11y works in MS apps. \r\nand the constant race of screenreader makers to keep up. Rather, \r\nI''m interested to know if an accessibility project, similar to the one \r\ncreated for ODF, will be created to address a11y requirements in the schema \r\ndefinitions themselves.</blockquote>\r\nNo answer from Jones so far, but perhaps one will follow later today. </p>\r\n\r\nAt the moment, most commentators are focusing on the immediate impact of currentevents.  David Berlind, who is on vacation and writes that he is therefore not tempted to spend hours on research, has nonetheless posted a thought piece on the Microsoft announcement titled <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=2189''>Microsoft ECMA/ISO move could give Office formats new lease on life </a>.  He asks a lot of good long term questions, and offers some interesting responses. </p>\r\n\r\nSo <b>where to end for now</b>?  Odds are, I could do another Google search right now and have enough new material to start all over again.  I''ll do that later today, but not now.  Instead, I''ll close with this prescient quote from <a href='' http://stephesblog.blogs.com/''>Steve Walli</a>:<blockquote>\r\nI''ve long argued that technology standards is a classical game of diplomacy where after the receptions and tea parties are over, the job is to defend sovereign territory while expanding one''s area of economic influence. If you''re really good, your best work goes unseen. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nBy Steve''s insightful definition, Microsoft has been a master of diplomacy â€“ with Massachusetts â€“ with Ecma â€“ with Apple and Intel â€“ and doubtless with many others, the results of which will become apparent over the days ahead. </p>\r\n\r\nWhatever else one thinks, one has to admit that Microsoft is very good at what it does.  Of course, since we''re talking about Microsoft, that also means that there are likely to be a few bugs in its strategy.  They''re bound to pop up sooner or later. </p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> <br/></p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

But how does Microsoft''s covenant compare to its old XML Schema?  From that perspective, its a real improvemen.', 'Earlier this week I posted \r\n<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1762''>an analysis</a> of the \r\n<a href=''http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/covenant.mspx''>"covenant not to sue"</a> announced by Microsoft with respect to their XML Reference Schema formats.  The release of that covenant followed closely on Microsoft''s announcement that it and a group of allied companies would \r\n<a href=''http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/nov05/11-21Ecma.mspx''>submit the XML formats</a> to Ecma International, a European standards body to form the basis for an Ecma standard that would in turn be offered to ISO for adoption. </p>\r\n\r\nIn that blog entry, I compared the commitment and impact of the Microsoft covenant to that of the covenant earlier announced by Sun in support of the OpenDocument OASIS Format standard (ODF), concluding that the Microsoft action, as a practical matter, fell short in a number of respects, when viewed from the perspective of an ISV or customer that needs to decide today which horse to bet on.  </p>\r\n\r\nSome of my friends at Microsoft thought that this was an unfair way to present the covenant.  By comparing the Microsoft covenant to Sun''s, I was necessarily ending up with a "glass half full" result.  Instead, they thought I should have provided an analysis of the covenant solely on its own merits. </p>\r\n\r\nThis strikes me as a fair request, so in order to present a more balanced picture, in this post I''ll look at the Microsoft covenant from the following perspective: how much better is the new covenant than the old 2003 XML Reference Schema license?  At the end of this entry, I''ll then try and reconcile the two analyses and see where we come out. </p>\r\n\r\nSo here we go.  The existing XML license, you may recall, already represented an effort by Microsoft to loosen up its intellectual property rights in the XML Schema, in particular in response to the government customers that are now showing the most interest in ODF.  As revised in November of 2003, the XML Schema license was also <a href=''http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/nov03/11-17XMLRefSchemaEMEAPR.mspx''>royalty free</a>.  But that applecart was upset this September, when the Massachusetts Information Technology Department (ITD) announced that it found the Microsoft license insufficiently open to meet the ITD''s new policy.  The action was doubly stinging, because earlier in the process Microsoft and the ITD had reached a non-specific understanding that Microsoft would make the changes necessary in order to make its XML Schema licensing terms acceptable (the ITD later concluded that the changes offered did not go far enough). </p>\r\n\r\nThe bottom line when comparing the <a href=''http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/ip/format/xmlpatentlicense.asp''>old licensing regime</a> and the new covenant is that the covenant represents a substantial improvement for developers and users.  Here are the important differences: </p>\r\n\r\nA.  A covenant not to sue of this type is self-executing.  In other words, there is no need to go to a website and agree to the terms of use in order to benefit from the license, either through a clickwrap agreement, or (in the case of the old Microsoft license) by including a required notice in any software that a developer distributes, licenses or sells. </p>\r\n\r\nB.  The principal concern of open source developers under the old license (the  restrictions applicable to "downstream" parties) disappears, because the downstream party automatically has its own license under the covenant.  Here is the old language: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf you distribute, license or sell a Licensed Implementation, this license is conditioned upon you requiring that the following notice be prominently displayed in all copies and derivative works of your source code and in copies of the documentation and licenses associated with your Licensed Implementation: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n"This product may incorporate intellectual property owned by Microsoft Corporation. The terms and conditions upon which Microsoft is licensing such intellectual property may be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/odcXMLRef/html/odcXMLRefLegalNotice.asp." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nBy including the above notice in a Licensed Implementation, you will be deemed to have accepted the terms and conditions of this license. You are not licensed to distribute a Licensed Implementation under license terms and conditions that prohibit the terms and conditions of this license. </p>\r\n\r\nYou are not licensed to sublicense or transfer your rights. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe last restriction - the inability to sublicense - was particularly problematic for the open source community.  </p>\r\n\r\nC.  There are no longer any restrictions on the uses to which the specifications may be used.  The old license, for example, includes this language: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nExcept as provided below, Microsoft hereby grants you a royalty-free license under Microsoft''s Necessary Claims to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise distribute Licensed Implementations solely for the purpose of reading and writing files that comply with the Microsoft specifications for the Office Schemas.  A "Licensed Implementation" means only those specific portions of a software product that read and write files that are fully compliant with the specifications for the Office Schemas.  </blockquote>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft had included a limited carve-out for its government customers, as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nBy way of clarification of the foregoing, given the unique role of government institutions, end users will not violate this license by merely reading government documents that constitute files that comply with the Microsoft specifications for the Office Schemas, or by using (solely for the purpose of reading such files) any software that enables them to do so. The term "government documents" includes public records. </blockquote> \r\n\r\nAll this is now swept away.  The correlative language in the new covenant simply says: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft irrevocably covenants that it will not seek to enforce any of its patent claims necessary to conform to the technical specifications for the Microsoft Office 2003 XML Reference Schemas posted at http://msdn.microsoft.com/office/understanding/xmloffice/default.aspx (the â€œSpecificationsâ€) against those conforming parts of software products. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, this last factor may not be as big a difference as the brevity of the new language suggests, but at minimum it leaves less room for concern about what is and is not permissible.</p>\r\n\r\nSo is the new covenant a significant improvement?  There is no question that it is, and Microsoft therefore deserves credit for moving its IPR position so substantially.  Hopefully it will take the same posture with other patents in its portfolio in the future, where significant standards opportunities arise. </p>\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, then, how do we most fairly reconcile the glass half empty of my last post and the glass half full described above into a single image? </p>\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two views is that the Microsoft covenant does not relate (for example) to one of the many Web services specifications that it, IBM and BEA have submitted to various standards organizations over the past several years.  In those cases, there were usually no alternative standards in play, nor (yet) any compliant products, and therefore any assertion made by Microsoft at the time of submitting a specification for consideration by a standards body would be pure gain to the marketplace â€“ clearly a glass half full (or more). </p>\r\n\r\nWith respect to the current situation, however, the ODF standard is already in the marketplace, is already supported by several products, and has already been submitted to ISO for adoption.  So if one were to put oneself in the position of a developer or a government agency, the analysis of my previous post becomes relevant:  am I better off under the Sun covenant and the OASIS IPR policy, or am I better off (or at least no worse off) under the Microsoft covenant and pledge to seek Ecma adoption, and then ISO endorsement? </p>\r\n\r\nFrom this market perspective, Microsoft arguably needs to go farther than Sun, rather than less far, to provide equivalent comfort to those currently choosing between ODF and the Microsoft schemas.  The reason is because Ecma has not yet taken control of the XML schemas, much less adopted them.  Until then Microsoft still controls (and can therefore change) the formats, or could withdraw the formats from Ecma if it was not pleased with the direction that the Ecma working group wished to go.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could it do to close this situational gap, if it wished?  Here are some suggestions: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n1.  Enter into a written agreement with Ecma not to withdraw the XML formats from forming the basis for a new Ecma standard, or disclose such a written undertaking, if it has already been entered into. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Announce at what point the XML formats will pass from Microsoft control to that of the Ecma working group (in other words, on what date will Microsoft have no greater voice than any other working group member over any changes the working group wishes to make to the formats?) </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Announce whether, and how, the XML formats may change between now and the hand over date. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Make a commitment to remain a contributing member of the Ecma working group supporting continuing development of the formats, and more importantly, make a long term commitment to support the standardized schemas, so that others that support the new standard, or buy products that support the standard, are not stranded in the future.  Yes, this is more than Sun has committed to, but Sun does not have an 85% (or greater) market share of office productivity software seats. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Disclose whether it is aware of any third party patents that would be infringed by implementation of the XML schema that are currently covered by Microsoft cross licenses, and whether the owners of those patents will be bound under those cross-license not to sue those that build implementations of the XML Schema under the new covenant. </p>\r\n\r\n6.  Consolidate the promise to cover the Office 12 version of the XML formats into the covenant not to sue.  Currently, the promise to do so is on a different Web page, making its legal force more questionable. </p>\r\n\r\n7.  Clarify the relationship between the new covenant and the previously required copyright notice, and whether copyright notices will be required in any implementation of the XML Schemas if they are adopted by Ecma.  I believe that this is less than obvious at the moment, after reading the various Web pages at the XMLS Schema pages of the Microsoft site.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again, and in fairness, it''s important to note that most of the above represent gap fillers, and are relevant only for the next 12 to 18 months (e.g., the time between now and the date upon which ISO may adopt a standard based on the Microsoft formats), and some concerns noted above will be eliminated as various milestones in the Ecma process are achieved.  If Ecma, and then ISO, adoption follows, then there will be very few differences of substance to be found between the Microsoft and the Sun covenants that would be of concern to either developers or end-users. </p>\r\n\r\nSo where does that leave someone today who needs to make a procurement decision?  Necessarily, comparing not only apples and oranges, but quite a few other types of fruit as well.  </p>\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, Office is well known, widely used, and will continue to be energetically developed, while ODF implementations are new and not yet as fully featured.  On the other hand, converters are already under development to transition Office documents for use with products that support ODF, and there are already multiple products in the marketplace that support ODF, including open source versions.  Again, the XML formats have been created (not surprisingly) to date solely to meet the needs of Microsoft products and are therefore presumably well crafted for that purpose, while the ODF formats have been developed to serve a wider consensus of needs.  </p>\r\n\r\nMost significantly for purposes of this analysis, though, is the fact that more things are known today about the terms upon which ODF may be implemented, and what ODF itself actually covers.  After all, there will be other members of the Ecma working group, and the Ecma IPR policy will not require them to give as liberal assurances as Microsoft has offered in its covenant.  Also, standards processes can be long, contentious and less than (how to say diplomatically) straightforward.  Much can happen, and there is always the possibility of an impasse before the XML Schemas become ISO standards, if in fact that ever occurs. </p>\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, fair is fair.  Microsoft has moved its position considerably, and it deserves points for doing so.  Whether it has moved far enough from a strategic perspective remains to be seen.  </p>Of course, we shouldn''t have too long to wait to find out.  That''s why customers were invented. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i><b>Note: </b>This entry does not constitute the rendering of legal advice; please consult your own attorney before making any decisions involving Microsoft''s intellectual property rights.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

I''ll then integrate these into the analyses of the Microsoft covenant that I posted earlier this week (the  <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1762''>first</a> by comparing the Microsoft covenant to that previously given by Sun, and the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1769''>second</a> evaluating the Microsoft covenant solely on its own merits):   </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are a number of questions which customers, the development community,\r\ngovernments and the general public need answered in order to properly\r\nevaluate this press release.<blockquote>\r\n\r\n   1.  Will there still be proprietary extensions within the Microsoft XML\r\n   implementation that are known only to Microsoft and keep the\r\n   implementation from being fully open and will the format include macros\r\n   that call on proprietary application?</p>\r\n   2.  Are there intellectual property constraints which would preclude or make\r\n   difficult the adoption of this technology as a truly open standard?</p>\r\n   3.  Are there licensing terms which would preclude implementation by the\r\n   open source community? </p>\r\n   4.  Why will it be 18 months before developers will be able to get the full\r\n   specification from ECMA and if that is due to ECMA''s process why doesn''t\r\n   Microsoft release it to the public before hand? </blockquote></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf my review of the Microsoft covenant is on target, questions 2 and 3 are largely resolved by the release of the covenant, although this assumes that the XML Reference Schema are themselves sufficient to allow a developer to do as much with them as she could with the ODF formats, which is something I am not competent to judge.  The first and last questions still seem like good ones to me.  </p>\r\n\r\nI''ll see if I can get an updated position from IBM next week to see what their official reaction to the covenant may be, and in the meantime, reproduce below the full statement for context and tone. </p>\r\n\r\n<b><center>* * * * * * * * *</center></p></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n     IBM and others who have been at the forefront of OpenDocument support and\r\nimplementation have read Microsoftâ€™s announcement with great interest. </p>\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with any company in the deployment of truly open\r\ndocument formats, both here in the United States, and around the world.  It\r\nis our hope that in the coming days, Microsoft will provide additional\r\nimportant details which will serve to clarify their position.\r\nSpecifically, does this announcement represent a true commitment to\r\nopenness? </p>\r\n\r\nThere are a number of questions which customers, the development community,\r\ngovernments and the general public need answered in order to properly\r\nevaluate this press release.<blockquote>\r\n\r\n   Will there still be proprietary extensions within the Microsoft XML\r\n   implementation that are known only to Microsoft and keep the\r\n   implementation from being fully open and will the format include macros\r\n   that call on proprietary application? </p>\r\n   Are there intellectual property constraints which would preclude or make\r\n   difficult the adoption of this technology as a truly open standard? </p>\r\n   Are there licensing terms which would preclude implementation by the\r\n   open source community? </p>\r\n   Why will it be 18 months before developers will be able to get the full\r\n   specification from ECMA and if that is due to ECMA''s process why doesn''t\r\n   Microsoft release it to the public before hand? </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIBM has been an active participant in past ECMA activities and we look\r\nforward to closely following consideration of this proposed standard within\r\nthat body. </p>\r\n\r\nWe also remain committed to the OpenDocument Format work that has already\r\nbeen completed in OASIS and which is currently being considered in ISO.\r\nOur customers and our industry are best served by a strong commitment to\r\nopen, industry standards, including open document formats. </p>\r\n\r\nGovernment customers already have recognized just how imperative it is to\r\nhave a truly open document format to ensure both choice among competing\r\nsolutions and to preserve their historical data. </p>\r\n\r\nWe look forward to a meaningful discussion within the IT industry on this\r\nsubject so we can all better meet these important customers'' needs. </p>\r\n\r\n<b><center>* * * * * * * * *</center></p></b>\r\n\r\n<i><b>Note: </b>This entry does not constitute the rendering of legal advice; please consult your own attorney before making any decisions involving Microsoft''s intellectual property rights.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

An article in today''s <i>Globe</i> suggests the wrong answer.', 'Recently I contributed an <a href=''http://www.masshightech.com/displayarticledetail.asp?art_id=70337&sec_id=35''>op/ed piece</a> to Mass High Tech, a regional technology business magazine, called "State House: City on a Hill or Tammany Hall?"  The subject was the amendment introduced into the Massachusetts Senate that would, if passed, deprive Peter Quinn''s Information Technology Department (ITD) of its ability to set prudent technology rules for the Executive Agencies of the Commonwealth. I also blogged on this a number of times, most pointedly in a piece called <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1745''>A Nasty Little Turf Battle (Massachusetts Style)</a>.  </p>\r\n\r\nIn the op/ed piece, I began as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere is a drama unfolding today that uniquely demonstrates the best and worst that Massachusetts has to offer. On the one hand, it evokes our historical leadership in society and technology. But on the other, it lays bare Beacon Hillâ€™s penchant for self-interested political bickering at the expense of the common good. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nAfter describing how the ITD reached it''s decision, I noted: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nPraise for its action has come from places throughout the country, where several states are contemplating adoption of ODF, and from around the world, where other governments are on a similar track.</p>\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s Massachusetts at its best, providing a shining example to the nation and the world. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nAfter desribing the "nasty little turf battle," I concluded as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat happens next will be watched closely around the world. Already, many of the largest technology companies are moving to support ODF, sparked first by the ITDâ€™s decision to adopt the ODF standard, and then energized by the political challenges to the ITDâ€™s ODF decision. </p>\r\n\r\nSo here we stand on the verge of two possibilities. The first is that we will once again shine a beacon to the world, demonstrating our technical leadership at home and abroad. The second is that the legislature will kill the ODF policy, thereby demonstrating instead not our leadership, but our well-deserved reputation for political infighting at the expense of our citizens. </p>\r\n\r\nWhich shall it be? </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, if the world is in fact watching what''s going on in Boston, the light is not only out, but today it''s been tossed into the gutter.   After going after Peter Quinn''s authority, it now appears that someone may be after his good name as well. </p>\r\n\r\nHere''s a story by staff writer Stephen Kurkjian that appeared in today''s <i><a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/26/romney_administration_reviewing_trips_made_by_technology_chief/''>Boston Globe</a> </i>:<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<center><b>Romney administration reviewing trips made by technology chief</b></center></p>\r\n\r\nThe Romney administration has launched a review of several out-of-state trips that its top technology officer took to conferences sponsored in part by companies who stand to benefit from a change in computer software used by the state. </p>\r\n\r\nPeter J. Quinn, director of the state''s Informational Technology Division and its chief information officer, has traveled to 12 out-of-state conferences in the last two years, visiting Brazil, Ottawa, San Francisco, Japan, Puerto Rico, and other locations, records show. Most of the conferences were sponsored by technology and information companies. </p>\r\n\r\nRomney administration officials are investigating whether Quinn violated travel procedures by not obtaining written authorization for six of the trips -- to Brazil, Ottawa, San Francisco, and other cities -- since September 2004. For six other trips, he received written approval from his supervisor. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe article goes on to note that Quinn went through proper procedures for all trips in 2004, but that in 2005, his superior, Eric Kriss had given him verbal approval.  Some expenses he paid himself, most were paid for by sponsors.  Quinn also consulted ITD counsel regarding what  approval procedures would be required. </p>\r\n\r\nThe <i>Globe</i> interviewed Quinn in connection with the article, and notes in part: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal of interest, both in the government sector and the private sector, in the adoption of Open Standards by Massachusetts," Quinn said in an e-mail. ''''The interest is focused on the why we adopted standards and what we learned throughout our journey. As a result, I have found myself in demand as a conference speaker. Each interaction is an opportunity for me to continue my learning. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo there we have it.  The CIO of Massachusetts is invited to speak all over the world about the leadership that the Commonwealth is demonstrating, and now he is being investigated to see whether he may have failed to dot his i''s and cross his t''s on his expense reports. </p>\r\n\r\n I''m not suggesting, of course, that conflict of interest rules are not serious and necessary - they are both.  However, Quinn is being faulted for not disclosing the identity of those who sponsored his trips, and the nature of any business dealings the ITD might have them.  And speakers are invited, and their fees are paid, by conference organizers, and not individual sponsors, a distinction that the <i> Globe</i> fails to make: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nEven though a galaxy of computer companies are listed as sponsors of many of the conferences, Quinn did not list any of them on his authorization forms or the business relationships any of them have with the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOne wonders whether anyone would have been better off if Quinn had stapled a page of logos to an authorization form and added "We buy some or all of our products from these companies."  The article also notes that Quinn told them that he frequently took night flights to lessen time away from the job - hardly the way to take a junket. </p>\r\n\r\nThe big question, of course, is whether the <i>Globe</i> thought to look into Quinn''s travel vouchers on its own, or whether it was suggested to them that they just might want to start asking questions on such an unlikely topic.  If the latter, we know the answer to my rhetorical question:  Massachusetts politics would rather roll around in the gutter, than shine a beacon to the world from Beacon Hill.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

It''s an important step forward for digital preservation and will help us fulfill the British Library''s core responsibility of making our digital collections accessible for generations to come.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe press release also listed Apple, Barclays Capital, BP (British Petroleum),  Essilor, Intel Corporation, NextPage Inc., Statoil ASA and Toshiba, as well as the British Library and Microsoft, as the cosponsors offering the XML schema to Ecma. </p>\r\n The immediate effect of the announcement was to negate a good deal of the forward momentum that had built up Since the Massachusetts Information Technology Division (ITD) had announced its adoption of the OpenDocument format (ODF)developed by OASIS and already submitted to ISO. </p>           \r\n\r\nBut, as is  so often the case, first impressions are not always complete, and therefore can create an inaccurate impression.  And so it is here.  </p>\r\n\r\nAn article by Peter Wiggins appeared this morning at InfoToday.com, titled, <a href=''http://www.infotoday.com/newsbreaks/nb051128-3.shtml''>British Library and Others Join Microsoft in Document Standards Effort\r\n</a>.  Wiggins apparently interviewed the British Library''s Adam Farquawar, and includes a number of quotes, including the following: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe think itâ€™s fantastic that Microsoft is opening up the MS Office formats to standardization. </p>\r\n\r\nI think that it is significant that Microsoft is taking this step. Microsoft is listening to customers who want to ensure that they have full access to the content that they have created. The route that they are followingâ€”standards-based followed by standardizationâ€”is a very positive one, and I anticipate that the resulting standardized formats will have excellent preservation properties. There are many alternate routes that they could have taken! </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo far, this could have been scripted by Microsoft''s own PR deparment.  But the concluding paragraphs of the article provide a very different perspective (emphasis added by me): <blockquote>\r\n\r\nEarly in November, Microsoft announced a project to digitize 100,000 rare and out-of-print books from the British Library collection. [For more information, see the NewsBreak at http://www.infotoday.com/newsbreaks/nb051121-2.shtml.] Farquhar says that that effort is not directly related to the Open XML announcement: <i><b>â€œSome people think we are adopting Microsoft formats as our standard for digital preservation. This is not right; we are striving to make sure that content we receive in MS formats will be preserved.â€ </b></i>He continued: â€œWhat format will we deliver? We deliver a lot of articles and in many formats. We deliver content in PDF, Office Open, ODF, TIFF â€” whatever format the customer wants.â€\r\n </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn short, the British Library is not recommending the XML Reference Schema as an exclusive solution, but giving a sigh of relief that if Microsoft has decided to offer some sort of methodology to permit long-term preservation. </p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it takes time for news such as this to make its way into the marketplace, if it ever becomes widely disseminated at all.  In Massachusetts, the flow of high-quality, timely information is particularly important, because the legislature will decide in the not too distant future whether the ITD''s ODF policy will live or die (sadly,  the same may apply to the ITD''s chief, State CIO Peter Quinn, if his <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1771''>opponents</a> have anything to say about it).  </p>\r\n\r\nHow soon could a decision be made by the Legislature?  My most recent information is that passage of the bill in question is unlikely before the end of the year, but this should not be regarded as conclusive.  Of note in this regard is the fact that another public discussion will be held on December 6, this time convened by Senator Hart, and (this time) including advocates on both sides of the issue. </p>\r\n\r\nHopefully, this will provide an opportunity for a more balanced public airing of the facts at issue than occurred on October 31.  I''ll provide further details as they become available. </p>\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

If you were stuck in holiday traffic between Boston and New York all that time, here''s what you missed: first, Microsoft''s <a href=''http://pajamasmedia.com/newsml/html/2005/11/21/6456816_Microsoft_Offers.shtml''>Ecma announcement </a>on Monday, followed by the release of it''s <a href=''http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/covenant.mspx''>covenant not to sue</a> on Tuesday, and finally the much-criticized Boston <i>Globe</i>-"instigated" investigation into Peter Quinn''s <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1775''>travel authorizations</a>.   Needless to say, a number of people have had a lot to say in response.</p>\r\n\r\nWhere to begin? For flavor, here are some of  the articles that have appeared in just ZDnet.com over the last two days:</p>\r\n\r\nFor starters, Dana Bankenhorn, in a piece titled <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=506''>Massachusetts open source fight becomes partisan</a> connected the dots in Massachusetts into a totally Republicans v. Democrat picture that ultimately ties into presidential and gubernatorial ambitions.  </p>\r\n\r\nLess speculatively, but still at ZDNet.com, David Berlind got <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2192''>Larry Rosen''s</a> take on the Microsoft covenant not to sue from the open source perspective.  Larry pronounced himself "delighted," saw no issues within the four corners of the covenant, and called for strong participation by open source advocates in the Ecma process to try and ensure that result.   David goes on to explore some of the questions that have been raised regarding the covenant, such as whether the patent waiver would apply in the case of a partial, as compared to a full, implementation of the XML Reverence Schemas. </p>\r\n\r\nAcross the pond, ZDNet.com.UK Ingrid Marson (with a keen eye for expert sources) quoted me extensively in a piece titled <a href=''http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/windows/0,39020396,39238666,00.htm''>Microsoft file standard offers ''minimum openness''</a>.  Ingrid''s focus was the Microsoft covenant not to sue.</p>\r\n\r\nCompleting the rounds at ZDNet.com, Martin LaMonica concluded that <a href=''http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5973440.html''>Mass. warms to Microsoft Office standard</a>, quoting Commonwealth Secretary for Finance and Administration Thomas Trimarcho as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe commonwealth is very pleased with Microsoft''s progress in creating an open document format. If Microsoft follows through as planned, we are optimistic that Office Open XML will meet our new standards for acceptable open formats," the statement said. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Trimarcho, let''s turn to what the vendor camp had to say. Earlier today I got a copy of a strongly worded letter that Sun delivered to Secretary Trimarcho over the signature of Sun Director of Standards Carl Cargill (cc''ing Governor Romney) that reads in part as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nRecent press reports have suggested that Microsoftâ€™s Office 12 XML-based format would also be an acceptable choice, despite the currently proprietary nature of the product. While Microsoft has promised to eventually submit Office 12 to a standards body, the Commonwealth must act on existing open standards to best serve its future needs for document exchange. Just as an agency would not purchase a product before its actual availability, so too would it be a mistake to rely on a single vendorâ€™s promise to submit a new product to a standards body at some point in the future. The Commonwealth owes no less to its taxpaying citizens....</p>\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealthâ€˜s process began as an effort to ensure that the documents created by its agencies would be owned by those offices and by its citizens for all eternity, without the need to negotiate or pay for continued access to them again in the future each time a new version of proprietary software is released. This process began as an effort to break away from the lock-in to certain expensive technologies, the costs of which ultimately accrue directly to taxpayers. This process began with a desire to create a level playing field so that innovation in the market would flourish, enabling better delivery of government services. </p>\r\n\r\nThis process should not end with the acceptance of a promise from those who seek to maintain a costly status quo, which accrues only to one companyâ€™s bottom line and denies the citizens of the Commonwealth the value they deserve from their tax dollars. </p>\r\n\r\nOnly after a specification has been approved by a broadly supported standards body â€“ one that demonstrates acceptable levels of openness by being available to all competing products â€“ should the Commonwealth consider including that open standard as one of its own. This â€œspectrum of opennessâ€ includes the ability of multiple, competing vendors to participate in creating the standard. It also includes the presence of a wide range of developers using the standard, including those from the open source community, who have sufficient rights to produce competing products. These are characteristics that the Commonwealth can only judge at the conclusion of a proposed standards process (e.g. standards body ratification). </blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou can read the complete letter at <a href=''http://blogs.sun.com/piper''>Piper Cole''s Weblog</a> (Piper is Sun''s VP of Global Government & Community Affairs).</p>\r\n\r\nContinuing with vendor reaction, IBM VP of Open Standards and Open Source Bob Sutor had much to say at his blog, including the following <a href=''http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=384&entry=100851''>out-takes</a>: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe know the old situation with the Microsoft XML formats: they created them, they changed them whenever they wanted to do so, and they had a license that was restrictive and prevented GPL implementations. Not so open, and people noticed, particularly in Massachusetts. </p>\r\n\r\nWhat''s the situation with the new covenant not to sue and the plan for ECMA? Let''s look at the five areas for openness in this case: </p>\r\n\r\nDevelopment: Microsoft has done all development on the Office XML formats by itself. Will the ECMA work be a rubberstamp or will ECMA members truly have a chance to participate? Will they do so? If the charter of the new technical committee allows no real modifications to what Microsoft has put forth, this fails this part of the openness criteria miserably. The new ECMA technical committee (TC) should have the opportunity to make whatever changes it sees fit. It is the responsibility of those who care and may even want to see some sort of OpenDocument Format/Microsoft XML format convergence to take part and lay the groundwork for that eventuality. But what if this causes product delays? Well, that''s just life in a standards world. HTML changed when it became standardized in the W3C from what Netscape and Microsoft had first implemented. The world is better for it. </p>\r\n\r\nMaintenance: Will the ECMA TC make whatever changes it, as a community, thinks to be appropriate beyond the first version? Backward compatibility with what the ECMA TC first standardizes and not necessarily with what it is handed as input is important, but the community can decide to do what it pleases. Again, life in a standards world. Vendors or groups can always implement the ECMA standard in the next version of their software. No single vendor should be allowed to make its own independent changes to the standard, unless this particular standardization effort is a sham. Also, this TC has to be a real joint effort and not just a single vendor making all the decisions. Just with Development, all minutes of all TC meetings should be public. For comparison, all the OASIS OpenDocument Format TC email list entries and minutes are public. </p>\r\n\r\nAccession: I suspect it will not be an issue getting a free copy of the spec, but we''ll need to watch this. The ISO usually charges for copies of its specs (with some exceptions), if this effort gets that far. Will we all be able to see the development of the spec in ECMA or will we have to wait until it becomes final there? This is important because developers need to see a spec as it develops so that they can prepare implementations, not to mention debug the spec in progress. </p>\r\n\r\nImplementation: Microsoft has made its covenant, but we''ll need to see what others do in ECMA. If the spec ends up being (F)RAND overall, it is not particularly useful for all types of implementation, particularly open source. So whatever Microsoft has or has not done so far, we will need to see what the licensing looks like in ECMA. To be blunt: I don''t think anything other than RF with some simple conditions like narrow defensive termination will be sufficient. Stay vigilant. We also need to see what the copyright license is like, since we have not seen anything about this yet. Microsoft has made progress in the openness direction with its covenant not to sue (and see Andy Updegrove''s latest analysis) but they need to continue that openness trend in ECMA. </p>\r\n\r\nAlso, and this is really important, by standardizing its formats in ECMA, Microsoft should be giving up the right to include proprietary extensions of the spec when it creates its implementations. Repeat after me: NO PROPRIETARY EXTENSIONS. </p>\r\n\r\nModification by Others: We''ll have to see what the copyright situation is here, as I mentioned above. Also, does the language in Microsoft''s covenant not to sue...mean that you can''t implement a subset of the spec to implement a profile, say, and still avoid difficulty? We don''t know, but we should find out....</p>\r\n\r\nIn summary, the move last week was interesting, but does not radically change the world. In my opinion, ODF and the applications that support it now and plan to support it are the best bet for an interoperabile future. Indeed, the ECMA action might be viewed as a move to fracture the existing industry standardization, and should be viewed in that light until proven otherwise. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf you''re not worn out yet and missed my blog post from <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1775''>earlier today</a>, check out this quote from Adam Farquhar, previously quoted in Microsoft''s Ecma press release as an XML Reference Schema supporter: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nEarly in November, Microsoft announced a project to digitize 100,000 rare and out-of-print books from the British Library collection. [For more information, see the NewsBreak at http://www.infotoday.com/newsbreaks/nb051121-2.shtml.] Farquhar says that that effort is not directly related to the Open XML announcement: â€œSome people think we are adopting Microsoft formats as our standard for digital preservation. This is not right; we are striving to make sure that content we receive in MS formats will be preserved.â€ He continued: â€œWhat format will we deliver? We deliver a lot of articles and in many formats. We deliver content in PDF, Office Open, ODF, TIFF â€” whatever format the customer wants.â€ </blockquote>\r\n\r\nOne could go on (and on).

The letter is signed by IBM''s VP of Standards and Open Source, Dr. Robert Sutor (it was Bob, you may recall, who hosted the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1705''>Armonk Meeting</a> back on November 4. </p>\r\n\r\nBob''s letter doesn''t hesitate to establish IBM''s right to make its opinion heard.  It opens as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWith all the recent activity around document formats and the strong leadership position taken by Massachusetts, I''m writing to you to reaffirm IBM''s full support for the OASIS OpenDocument Format for Office Applications (ODF) standard. IBM, with our nearly 5000 employees in Massachusetts, is pleased to continue our active participation in the open, community-driven OASIS standardization process as well as our support for this important global standard in an upcoming version of our IBM Workplace product. Massachusetts is one of the epicenters of IBM software innovation, which will continue to be a key growth engine for our company. Lotus, Rational and Ascential all call the Commonwealth home and are developing the next generations of customer solutions based on open standards. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs it happens, Massachusetts lost over 6,000 software jobs last year, dropping from 135,00 to 128,600, according to what until recently was called the Massachusetts Software Council.  </p>\r\n\r\nBob''s approach in the letter is to compliment Trimarcho''s office on the approach that led to the selection of ODF, and to call upon the Commonwealth to continue to apply the same high standards in evaluating other contenders for approval.  In that regard, he notes the distinction between the already completed, open process that has brought ODF not only to adoption by a well-regarded international standards organization (OASIS), but to multiple implementations as well, and contrasts this reality with the fact that Microsoft''s XML Reference Schema are still more than a year from achieving the same status â€“ if ever. </p>\r\n\r\nHere''s how he puts it: <blockquote>\r\nIn particular, you should study closely how standards are initially developed, maintained, made available, allowed to be implemented, and are made usable with other standards. Within OASIS, ODF was both developed and will be maintained in an open fashion by multiple stakeholders. This is not just a promise that might come true in a year or two, this is what has already happened. History has shown that this is a strong disincentive for vendors who might want to add interoperability-breaking, proprietary extensions. Anyone can freely get a copy of the ODF standard and implement it. Since the ODF standard is already in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) fast track process, I''m confident that 2006 will be a very big year for adoption of ODF and ODF-compliant software by governments, organizations, and businesses around the world. </p>\r\nAs you have done so far, you should require evidence of broad implementation of a standard. ODF has real, multiple implementations and there are more organizations building in support for it right now. This broad acceptance of and support for ODF is fact today and not something that is wished or hoped for in the future. In this way you will guarantee that Massachusetts can obtain the necessary software to run its citizens'' business in a cost effective way, while maintaining your historical legacy for all to read and access. </blockquote>\r\nSutor''s letter to Trimarcho follows one day after a letter of similar tenor and argument was sent by <a href=''http://blogs.sun.com/piper''>Sun Microsystems</a>, over the signature of its Director of Corporate Standards, Carl Cargill.  I don''t know the exact number of employees that Sun has here but it has a huge campus in Burlington, on Route 128, as well as other in-state locations.  I''d be surprised if it did not have at least several thousand employees within the Commonwealth.  That means that these two letters speak for somewhere between 6 and 7% of all high paying software jobs in Massachusetts.</p>\r\nThe net effect of these two letters, one would hope, is that the Commonwealth will (a) not repudiate the ITD''s commitment to ODF in the face of such strong support, and (b) await actual adoption in satisfactory form of the XML Reference Schema by (at least) Ecma, under acceptable license terms from not only Microsoft, but all Ecma members, before granting equivalent status to the Microsoft offering under Massachusetts'' IT policy. </p>\r\nThis kind of support is important to achieve that end, as it''s clear that Secretary of the Commonwealth William Francis Galvin and Senator Pacheco are hostile to State CIO Peter Quinn''s ODF initiative, and even Governor Romney''s office has been distancing himself from the ODF situation.  A statement from his office, attributed to Thomas Trimarco (to whom both the IBM and the Sun letters were addressed), <a href=''http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5973440.html''>reads as follows</a>: <blockquote>\r\nThe commonwealth is very pleased with Microsoft''s progress in creating an open document format. If Microsoft follows through as planned, we are optimistic that Office Open XML will meet our new standards for acceptable open formats. </blockquote>\r\nThe key words here, of course, are "follow though as planned."  Hopefully IBM''s and Sun''s focusing attention on what that should mean will help ensure that if the Microsoft formats come to be accepted as the equivalent of ODF in Massachusetts â€“ and elsewhere â€“ it will because they have earned it.\r\n\r\nYou can read the full text of Bob''s letter at <a href=''http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=384&entry=101092''>his blog</a>.

"Conformant" is not defined, meaning there is uncertainty needing legal advice. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nOK, let''s say a developer was to implement the XML Reference Schema in good faith, and wondered whether she was at risk because they didn''t know what "conformant" meant, or whether her application actually "conformed" to the degree required.  The good news is that when a court tries to help a jury figure out what to do in a situation like this, it tries to find out what the understood meaning of a term would be in the industry in question, and what the prevailing practices would be in applying that understanding. You''ll see that I will be coming back to this precept frequently as we go on.</p>\r\n\r\nSo far so good.  But now for the bad news.  Until relatively recently, the language used in standard setting IPR policies was surprisingly casual, because people just weren''t suing each other.  That started to change when Dell Computer was investigated by the FTC in connection with a consortium it was part of, and agreed to a consent decree that required it to license its patents royalty free under the standard in question.  After the Rambus case, people got even more serious.  So today, words are used more carefully and precisely, but too often what people think they mean is still not uniform.  For example, there is an American Bar Association Law and Technology subcommittee that has been holding bi-weekly conference calls for about a year now that is trying to create an annotated IPR policy, and they aren''t done yet. </p>\r\n\r\nSo what does "conformant" mean, then?  I believe that a jury, properly informed by expert witnesses, would conclude that "conformant" means the following: </p>\r\n\r\nA.  "Conformant" should have the meaning that a standard setting organization would give it. </p>\r\n\r\nB.  Standard setting organizations use several words in this general area.  Most commonly, "compliant," "conformant," and "certified."  The last one clearly means that the product has passed a test of some sort.  The first two usually mean only that the developer is asserting that it believes that its product complies with or conforms to the standard, unless the developer has specified what words can, and cannot, be used.  It is also understood that the level of achieved interoperability is likely to be lower than for a certified product that has actually passed a test. </p>\r\n\r\nC.  Since Microsoft has not defined "conformant," then I believe that a court would apply the definition I''ve outlined above, and therefore that a good faith effort to build a product that properly implements the XML Reference Schema should be regarded as fulfilling the terms of the Microsoft covenant.  This should be an adequate shield against liability. </p>\r\n\r\nBack to you, Simon, and I''ll try to be briefer, now that a couple of fundamental rules have been laid out.<blockquote>\r\n\r\n2. There is no provision for partial implementation, meaning true community-based development is not covered until complete. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nGood observation.  Superficially, one might wonder why someone might care one way or the other.  The reason is that if someone is going to waive their rights to assert a patent, then they expect that they will get some benefit as a result.  In the context of standard setting, that benefit is interoperability which, the vendor hopes, will lead more people to buy its product.  Why?  Because there will be more incentive for more vendors to build products, all of which are interoperable and competing on price and features, which will lead to a bigger market demand for everyone''s product.  The result is that the original vendor gets a smaller piece of a much bigger pie.  But -if someone doesn''t implement the whole standard, then the original patent owner doesn''t enjoy the benefit that they hope to gain by waiving their patent rights â€“ they''re just out their patent license fee. </p>\r\n\r\nBob Sutor gives a good explanation (at a more sophisticated technical level) of why complete implementations are important <a href=''http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=384&entry=101214''>here</a>.\r\n </p>\r\nSome IPR policies are explicit about this, saying that the patent pledge is made to "any product that implements all required elements of the specification"  and some are not, which might lead a jury to adopt the rule "if they meant it, they would have said it."  But I think on this one the right answer would be (subject to what I have to say after Simon''s next comment) that it''s understood in the trade that "conformant" means "implements the whole specification." </p>\r\nBack to Simon''s list (after only three paragraphs of punditry this time! <blockquote>\r\n3. It may well mean that implementation of just a word processor is impossible -- it implies that you have to implement everything (spreadsheets & all) to reach the bar.  </blockquote>\r\nSimon''s on target with a good question again, and he points out what would make a good law school question:  if you can divide a specification up into separate, independent pieces, does that make a difference? </p>\r\nMy guess is that a court would decide that someone should be able to take advantage of the covenant to develop just that word processor for three reasons.  First, because the patent owner would still benefit, because many people only need a word processor, and therefore all the documents that they would actually produce could be exchanged with owners of a full office suite.  The second is that there are at least some programs in the market that are just word processors, particularly those that are embedded in other types of products, such as email packages. Most important is the third reason: if you have an electronic document that you want to be able to open in 20 years, you won''t care whether it came from a word processor or a full suite â€“ you''ll still want to be able to access it, and that is a major goal for standardizing formats. </p>\r\nSimon''s turn again: <blockquote>\r\n4. It is specific to the version currently existing, meaning I can be hooked into supporting it now, but when Office 12 or Office 13 comes out & I update to be compatible with the format in that I can get sued. The covenant Sun uses creates ongoing protection. </blockquote>\r\nThis is a serious one, and it''s one that I''ve examined at length in two prior posts <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1762''>here</a> and then <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1769''>here</a>.  First, in fairness to Microsoft''s intention (although not it''s wordsmithing) and as I pointed out in the first of those posts, Microsoft does say at a separate page at it''s site that it will extend the same covenant to the Office 12 XML Reference Schemas.  But that''s as far as they''ve gone. </p>\r\nAgain, to be fair, the way standards organizations work, someone can always drop out and not have to make a patent pledge regarding any <i>new</i> parts of a revision of a specification.  But its undertakings are irrevocable and perpetual as to the version of the specification that was released while it was an involved member. </p>\r\nWhat''s situationally tricky here is that if Microsoft were to drop out while it still had such an enormous percentage of the marketplace, and then abandoned complying with the Ecma standard, or even simply added new features that extended beyond the standard (the infamous "proprietary extensions"), then what?  </p>\r\nWhere that takes me is that our hypothetical jury, looking to trade practice, would say that Microsoft has no obligation to give a new covenant to anyone for a new version unless it makes that promise now, because that is the prevailing trade practice.  So one hopes that Ecma will do something to close this gap as a condition to accepting Microsoft''s offer. </p>\r\nSimon''s turn again: <blockquote>\r\n5. It does not grant patents to the ECMA standard as it only applies to Office 11 XML. This means a new covenant will be needed for the ECMA work. </blockquote>\r\nAs noted, at a <a href='' http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/newvsold.mspx''>separate page</a>of it''s website, Microsoft says: " Microsoft will also be offering this same covenant with respect to the forthcoming specifications for the "Office 12" schema specifications."  I''ve said at my blog in the two posts previously mentioned that a court would be better persuaded if that language appeared in the covenant itself.  </p>\r\nThe reason is something called the "parol evidence" rule, which basically states that if you have a contract, it''s assumed that the whole deal is in that contract.  In this case, the covenant is what''s called a "unilateral contract," or one that binds only one party (Microsoft) â€“ but it''s still a contract, nonetheless, because Microsoft expects people to rely on it to their detriment. </p>\r\nBack to Simon one last time: <blockquote>\r\n6. If the same form of words were used for a contribution to ECMA, then those prototyping the ongoing evolution of the standard as ECMA changed it would lose protection the instant any change was made. It applies only to Microsoft''s input, not to ECMA''s output. Or maybe they would rather ECMA didn''t change anything? </blockquote>\r\nAll manner of business and legal concerns are swirling around in this one.  One can assume that Microsoft will want to change nothing in the XML Reference Schema that would require a change to Office, and who could blame them?  In fairness, it''s also worth noting that companies contribute technology to standard setting organizations all the time to act as the basis for standards.  Many accredited organizations (like IEEE, if memory serves) and consortia even require it, because they don''t want to issue a standard that isn''t instantiated in a product that people can immediately buy.  </p>\r\nBut acting as the basis for a standard, and being a completed standard, are two different things.  As such things go, the Ecma XML Reference Schema working group could turn out to be a great spectator opportunity, with open source advocates answering Larry Rosen''s call to police the process, with Novell already announcing that it will be an attentive participant, and with IBM presumably taking part as well (Sun, I believe, dropped out some time back â€“ but who knows, perhaps they will rejoin to be part of the fun as well). </p>\r\nBut if the Ecma process bogs down, or turns into Armageddon, then who wins and who loses?  After all, does Microsoft really <i>want</i> the XML Reference Schema to be adopted, or only to look like it''s being cooperative?  Interesting question, that. </p>\r\nThe fact of the matter is that Microsoft, so far, has only said on a Web page that it will make a covenant for the Office 12 versions of the XML Reference Schema â€“ and not for any Ecma standard based upon those Schema that may ultimately be adopted and issued.  If it wishes, it can stop right where it is, and to the extent the Ecma working group adds any extensions, Microsoft could utilize the Ecma RAND-tolerant policy for those portions of the resulting Ecma standard.   And, in fact, I think that''s fair dinkum, since no other Ecma member would be required to offer more than RAND terms for <i> any</i> of the elements of the resulting standard, and not just for any additions to the XML Reference Schemas that formed the starting point for the working group''s efforts.</p>\r\n\r\nBut here''s where the convergence of Simon''s first and last question bring us to an interesting conclusion: if Ecma <i>adds</i> to the Microsoft contribution, then a "conformant" implementation of the Ecma standard would have a subset of itself that was "conformant" to the XML Reference Schema, and the implementation would be entitled to the covenant as to the conformant part, and RAND benefits as to the balance.  But if instead of adding to, the Ecma working group <i>changes</i> part of the XML Reference Schema, then Microsoft could say "sorry â€“ a critical exception has occurred" â€“ and the covenant crashes. </p>\r\n\r\nWould Microsoft <i>do</i> that? </p>\r\n\r\nWell, as some lawyers like to say, "I''m sorry.  That''s not a legal question." </p>\r\n\r\n<i><b>Note: </b>While this entry is based on general principles of law and prevailing practices in standards development organizations, the conclusions I''ve offered are purely speculative, due to the number of variables involved and the vagaries of the courts.

If it''s not one thing, it''s another.', 'It''s been just over two weeks since the World Summit for the Information Society folded up its tents (literally) in Tunis.  I''ve been following the WSIS process for two years, and cumulating blog entries and news items for the last six months <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/news/cat.php?CID=25''>here</a>.  I also dedicated this <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/nov05.php''>November''s issue</a> of the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a> to the "compromise" that left the root zone of the Internet to the management of the U.S., and created a new Internet Governance Forum to accommodate the desires of the rest of the world to participate in decision making regarding the future use and impact of the Internet. </p>\r\n\r\nNow that everyone is back home, how is it going?  Here are a few notes and reports from all over that give a sense of what''s been happening. </p>\r\n\r\nFirst, as noted in an earlier entry titled <a href=''http://consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1751''>Spin Sets in on Internet Governance Compromise</a> everyone is claiming credit for how things did (or didn''t) turn out.  For example, here''s an excerpt from a report  at<a href=''http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=1283&dept_id=569301&newsid=15683447&PAG=461&rfi=9''>Coalfield.com</a> from <a href=''http://www.house.gov/boucher/''>Congressman Rick Boucher</a> (Dâ€“VA) to his constituents: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAt my strong urging, the U.S. House of Representatives has approved a measure which I co-authored to express the view of Congress that the Internet should remain open, free for all to use, global and seamless.  The legislation was approved unanimously in the House on Wednesday, Nov. 16â€¦.\r\n\r\nAs a result of efficient and even-handed American management, the Internet has become a global pathway of instant communications, which has spurred economic growth, improved the quality of people''s lives, and strengthened democratic institutions in this nation and around the world. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThings look rather different from the other side of the fence, however.  While noting "In fairness to [the United States], it has maintained a relatively hands-off role in respect of the Internet," an editorial in the <a href='' http://allafrica.com/stories/200512020240.html''>Abuja [Nigeria] Daily Trust </a> posted at allArica.com also states: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nUnpopular even before, this arrangement has now assumed a critical dimension with America''s crude approach to its self-declared war on "terror." In the long run, this US control of the Internet will be as untenable as it is unacceptable.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nA serious analysis of the impact of the Tunis Summit has been posted by Hans Klein, an Associate Professor of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Partner in the Internet Governance Project who has been following and writing about the WSIS process for some time, can be found <a href=''http://www.ip3.gatech.edu/images/Significance_of_WSIS-II_Tunis-05.pdf''>here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\nFurther details are also reaching the press relating to how the impasse over ICANN was finally broken.  Two days ago, TheRegister.com.uk (</i>"Biting the hand that feeds IT"</i>), which enjoys an 8/10 Google page rank and always has lively stories, posts the <a href='' http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/02/rice_eu_letter/ ''>full text of a letter</a> sent by Condoleeza Rice to British Home Secretary Jack Straw on November 7, less than two weeks before the Tunis Summit convened, in an effort to reverse the impact of the EU''s earlier desertion of the U.S. position on ICANN.  The Register''s Kieren McCarthy attributes great weight to the letter, concluding (rightly or wrongly) as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn the letter, Rice used strong language for a diplomatic missive, to stress how seriously the US administration was taking the issue and how determined it was to retain ICANN in overall charge of the internet. European diplomats privately confessed that the letter had a significant impact on their position. </p>\r\nThe result was that the EU never raised its inter-governmental forum again in World Summit meetings, and the end agreement stuck with the US position.</blockquote>\r\nThe Board of Directors of ICANN, meanwhile, is meeting today in Vancouver, British Columbia, and has posted the following <a href='' http://www.icann.org/minutes/''>agenda</a> on its minutes page.  It will be interesting to see how the WSIS experience informed and affected the decisions at today''s meeting when the resolutions passed at the meeting are posted at the same Webpage.</p>\r\n\r\nOne item that was not on the proposed agenda, but will presumably be discussed, 	will be several law suits filed against ICANN, as reported by sys.conNederlands in an article on December 1 titled <a href=''http://ne.sys-con.com/read/159349.htm''> Groups Tell ICANN That It Can''t in Internet Domain Name Furor</a>, and subtitled, " Lawsuits Filed in Wake of Proposed ICANN Renewal of Control".  The article reports in part as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nLess than two weeks after the U.S. private-public agency ICANN received the go-ahead at the United Nations WSIS meeting in Tunis to retain control over domain registration, ICANN in turn proposed to allow Verisign to handle this task for it through the year 2012. And just as there were howls of protest that the U.S.-based ICANN would be prone to exerting undue influence over the Internet in our global village, there are new howls coming from global registrars over Verisign''s continued monopoly on the key aspect of this critical function. </p>\r\n\r\nICANN''s draft proposal would give VeriSign exclusive control over the .com domain, and is being "vigorously opposed" by a group of notable domain registrars led by 1&1 Internet, who claim the plan harms competition within the Internet industry and could negatively impact end-users worldwideâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\nâ€œThe current draft of the agreement practically assigns .com to VeriSign forever,â€ said 1&1â€™s Domain Expert Eric Schaetzlein, who will present the registrar communityâ€™s concerns to ICANN at its meeting this week in Vancouver. â€œThis contradicts ICANNâ€™s core mission to promote competition in the Internet industry, which was established in its own by-laws and in the Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Department of Commerceâ€¦.â€ </p>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, two industry groups, The Coalition for ICANN Transparency (CFIT) and the World Association of Domain Name Developers (WADND), have filed antitrust lawsuits in U.S. federal court this week. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo the dust may have settled in Tunis, but the controversy is hardly over around the world on the subject of Internet maintenance and governance. </p>\r\n\r\nI''ll continue to report on this topic from time to time. </p>\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

As The New Delhi Economic Times, reported: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nNEW DELHIL: Global IT company IBM will start supporting ''open standards'' in India from early next year, by when the company would launch the new version of its Workplace Managed Client supporting Open Document Format (ODF). </p>\r\n\r\n"The next version to be launched in early 2006 will support the newly-ratified ODF providing flexibility of sharing information regardless of any software platform you are using," IBM Vice President of Standards and Open Source Bob Sutor told reporters here on Monday. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nMartin LaMonica had gotten the story earlier, and reported on late Sunday at <a href=''http://news.com.com/IBM+to+support+OpenDocument+early+next+year/2100-1013_3-5979150.html''>ZDNet</a>, IBM was following a different approach then simply bringing out another office suite:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nRather than create an analog to Microsoft Office, IBM is offering editors for creating documents, spreadsheets or presentations within a Web browser. Documents are delivered via a Web portal and stored in shared directories.

Moni, deputy director general of India''s NIC. "The choice, flexibility and reliability inherent in open standards like ODF are critical in our efforts to drive the eGovernance momentum in the country." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut the real government fun was to come a few hours later (less than an hour ago, as I write this), when Michael D. Rhodin, General Manager of Workplace, Portal and Collaboration Software for IBM â€“ and resident in Massachusetts â€“ emailed and faxed a letter to Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, announcing in great detail how the new technology had been developed inâ€¦(wait for it)â€¦Massachusetts.  Here are a few excerpts (the complete letter appears at the end of this entry):  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nI''d like to share some information on an exciting new IBM product that was built in Massachusetts but is expected to have implications on both a national and international level. </p>\r\n\r\nToday, IBM extended its support for open standards by announcing a new\r\nsoftware product designed to fully support the OASIS OpenDocument Format for Office Applications (ODF).  Designed at IBM''s development lab in Westford, Massachusetts, the IBM Workplace Managed Client will help protect an organization''s investment in corporate data by promoting consistency, reliability and open accessibility of its documents. </p>\r\n\r\nAs you know, Massachusetts is recognized across the globe as an incubator for software development. As the result of acquiring several\r\nMassachusetts-based companies, including Rational Software, Lotus\r\nDevelopment Corp. and Ascential Software, we now have over 4,000 IBMers\r\nbased in the Commonwealth.  Our employees are spread across IBM offices in Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, Westborough and Westford, where I have led the development of IBM''s collaboration software product line for the last two years. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nMassachusetts CIO Peter Quinn, you may recall, was the first State CIO to adopt ODF.  As I''ve pointed out before, his action provided a shining example of Massachusetts innovation in action, at a time when the Commonwealth is shedding rather than adding jobs to its software industry.  But what happened?  He was <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1745''>undermined in the legislature</a>, and even his speaking at IT conventions, which again showcased Massachusetts innovation, became the <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1771''>subject of an investigation</a> - not for taking payments, but for failing to get verbal authorizations converted into the required forms. He has also been accused (inaccurately) of being a partisan for open source, as compared to a partisan for sound, cost-effective IT management. </p>\r\n\r\nRhodin lays it on the line in this letter, supporting Quinn by showing that open standards and open source can save significant money â€“ something Quinn was questioned closely on during the earlier hearing:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs you heard previously, open standards help ensure flexibility and\r\nefficiency for business and governments around the world.  To bring this discussion to life, allow me to direct your attention to an analysis done in France following the implementation of open source products at the French tax agency (Direction GÃ©nÃ©rale des ImpÃ´ts). As a result of running software based on open standards, the agency is now saving around â‚¬20m per year â€” a considerable portion of the agency''s â‚¬200m yearly IT budget. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut Rhodin''s real message is to subtly point out that Romney - who is believed to be positioning himself for a presidential bid - has the choice of either latching on to ODF as a success story, or continue to backpedal as fast as he can away from a genuine Massachusetts success story: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe new Workplace Managed Client is one example of how IBM is driving\r\neconomic development in the Commonwealth.  Leveraging the business\r\necosystem, creating collaborative environments and maintaining focus on the end user are what enable growth.  The underlying framework of these\r\nactivities is open standards.  I''d like to echo IBM''s previous public\r\nstatement that commends the administration for the continuing and\r\nexhaustive open process that has been employed in evaluating the best\r\ntechnology solutions for the citizens of the Commonwealth. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn short, Rhodin says (as did Bob Sutor in a letter last week) don''t abandon that "exhaustive process" with an expedient pre-adoption of a competing format that is not yet, and possibly may never, achieve the status of a standard. </p>\r\n\r\nAll in all, a very satisfying day for Team ODF.  IBM''s move has flash, it has style â€“ and it has a point.  Big Blue''s actions today should be sufficient to move the ball back across the center field line, recovering much or all of the ground lost to Microsoft''s Ecma announcements just before Thanksgiving.  </p>\r\n\r\nThe game is far from over, but today, Team ODF evened up the score. </p>\r\n\r\n<center> * * * * * * * * *</P>\r\n\r\n<B>TEXT OF IBM LETTER TO GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY</B></P></center>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Mitt Romney  </br>\r\nGovernor, Commonwealth of Massachusetts </br>\r\nState House, Room 360 </br>\r\nBoston MA, 02133 </p>\r\n\r\nDear Governor Romney: </p>\r\n\r\nI''d like to share some information on an exciting new IBM product that was built in Massachusetts but is expected to have implications on both a national and international level. </p>\r\n\r\nToday, IBM extended its support for open standards by announcing a new\r\nsoftware product designed to fully support the OASIS OpenDocument Format for Office Applications (ODF).

"Rubberstamp" is the better word, if Ecma''s members vote to proceed.', 'Someone I know and trust has sent me a copy this evening of what he says are the "Terms of Reference" for Microsoft''s XML Reference Schema submission to Ecma.  It is these terms that I understand will be voted on by Ecma this Thursday and that would, if approved, comprise the charter of the working group that would convert the Microsoft submission into a draft standard for adoption by the Ecma membership, and then submission to ISO for adoption as a global standard.<p>\r\n\r\nAccording to the document I have received, the scope for the working group would be as follows:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Technical Committee is to produce a formal standard for office productivity applications within the Ecma International standards process which is <b>fully compatible with the Office Open XML Formats</b>.  The aim is to enable the implementation of the Office Open XML Formats by a wide set of tools and platforms in order to foster interoperability across office productivity applications and with line-of-business systems.  The Technical Committee will also be responsible for the ongoing maintenance and evolution of the standard.<i>[emphasis added]</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of the scope that I find to be significant.  The first is the use of the limiting words "which is fully compatible with the Office Open XML Formats."  In short, the effort will not be permitted to create a standard that is (as is the case with ODF) intended to be the best possible product-agnostic format standard, but to create a standard that describes the material submitted by Microsoft.  On the plus side, the charter does anticipate an ongoing maintenance effort that is not expressly tied to future Microsoft product developments.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe next section of the Terms is called the Introduction, and reads as follows (the emphasis is added by me, rather than present in the original):  <blockquote>\r\nThe objective of full compatibility with the Office Open XML Formats is adopted in order to <p>\r\n1.	<b>Guarantee continuous use of the existing base of Microsoft Office documents without losing any of the functionalities </b><br>\r\n2.	<b>Document all the options, properties, formatting, layout and other information of the existing Microsoft Office document base </b>using the W3C XML 1.0 language<br>\r\n3.	Guarantee interoperability by enabling standard-based XML 1.0 tools to create, read and write files conforming to the standardized file format <br>\r\n4.	Support the needs of governments and businesses to archive and preserve documents using an Open Standardized Format<br>\r\n5.	Enable standard transformations using W3C XSLT (or similar techniques) to extract or repurpose information from the file format\r\n6.	Support integration of custom defined schemas</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe language that I have highlighted demonstrates the degree to which the charter locks on documents created using Microsoft Office, and surprises me with it''s frankness.  The first point is most stark in this regard, speaking of "guaranteeing continuous use of the existing base of Microsoft Office documents without losing any of the functionalities."  Looked at from one perspective, this is a user friendly goal, as the great majority of the documents created in office environments over the last 10 or more years were, after all, created using Office. <p> \r\n\r\nBut basing a standard setting organization working group on so overtly proprietary a goal is highly unusual in my experience, as compared to chartering a group to create the best vendor neutral solution possible for the future.  After all, Microsoft could presumably create a converter without too much difficulty that could carry existing documents forward into the new standard if the Ecma working group thought that some degree of divergence would create a better industry-wide standard.  Stated another way, it is the job of a standards body to create great standards, and for vendors to adapt to them, not for standards bodies to act as rubber stamps for standards built to address the products of a single vendor.  The bold language in the second item goes even further than normal in this regard.<p>  \r\nThe third and last part of the Terms is called the Programme of Work, and reads as follows (emphasis added by me once more): <blockquote>\r\n1.	To Produce a formal Standard for office productivity documents which is <b>fully compatible with the Office Open XML Formats </b>(1)\r\nThis includes:<blockquote>\r\na.	Produce a standard <b>which is fully compatible with the Office Open XML Formats, including full and comprehensive documentation of those formats in the style of an international standard,</b> with particular attention given to enabling the implementation of the Office Open XML Formats by a wide set of tools and platforms in order to foster interoperability across office productivity applications and with line-of-business systems </br>\r\nb.	Produce a comprehensive set of W3C XML Schemas for the Office Open XML Formats, with particular attention given to self documentation of the schemas and testing of the XSDs for validation using a wide variety of XSD tools of the market and cross platform </blockquote>\r\n2.	To contribute the Ecma Office Open XML Formats standards to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for approval and adoption by ISO and IEC.<p>\r\nUpon completion of the Previous Items, the role of the Technical Committee will be: <blockquote>\r\n3.	To assume responsibility for maintaining the ECMA Office Open XML standard<br>\r\n4.	To evaluate and consider proposals for complementary or additional technology<br>\r\n5.	To assume responsibility for the evolution of the ECMA standard while ensuring backward compatibility with the previous versions to guarantee continuity in the use of the current and future formats<br>\r\n6.	To establish and maintain liaison with other ECMA TCs and with other Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) as appropriate to facilitate and promulgate the work of the TC<p>\r\n(1) to be submitted by Microsoft Corporation.</blockquote></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn summary, what I read here is the following: the working group would be told to take the offered schema and convert them, without change (or charge), into a standard, apply the Ecma imprimatur, and then submit them to ISO, so that users of Microsoft Office may seamlessly use their documents in conjunction with other conforming software, and so that Microsoft may obtain a unique market benefit.  The working group would also be told not to diverge in any way from this goal in order to improve the standard, or to address the needs of the users of any other products in existence, or to accommodate the functionality of any other product, or to serve the interests of any other vendor, or of any customer that has needs that cannot be served by Microsoft Office. <p>\r\n\r\nI would submit that such a request is not consistent with the role of a standards body, but rather the diversion of an organization created to serve the needs of an industry to the unique demands of a single vendor.  Were Ecma to be based in the United States, I would not be surprised if accepting such a charter would result (if discovered by the IRS) in the loss of the standards developer''s tax-exempt status. <p>\r\nI have also received a summary of objections raised to the Terms of Reference that I do not feel comfortable sharing here, but which indicate that there have been negative comments offered by at least some members regarding the substance of the Terms and the process followed to date, both internal and external to Ecma. <p>\r\n\r\nA final note:  as expected, there is no mention in the charter of any special IPR requirements that would be imposede on any member of Ecma.  This would indicate that while Microsoft may renew it''s royalty-free commitment, any other member(s) of Ecma with a relevant patent would have the right to charge a royalty to implement the resulting standard, or to require terms that would be inconsistent with open source licensing. <p>\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting indeed to see what reception the Terms receive within Ecma, as well as how Ecma is viewed in the global standard setting community in the future (i.e., as a true standard setting body, or as a mere conduit for single vendors to ISO approval).  The answer to that question will depend on whether the Terms, as offered, are approved.<p>\r\n\r\nNote:  Pamela Jones has looked into the Ecma process and its rules, and has posted a <a href=''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051207020812228''>detailed review</a> of how things operate in that venue.<p>\r\n            \r\n\r\n <i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

And then there are other Massachusetts'' headquartered IT companies like EMC, RSA, and Akamai (all in attendance at the TechNet dinner) that have stayed on the sidelines.  My understanding is that quite the opposite happens in Silicon Valley; that when certain out-of-town technology companies look to influence local or national legislation, that Silicon Valley-headquartered companies will actually cross party lines to stand together to keep the out-of-state "invaders" at bay. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n(2)  Steve Walli posts two excellent entries on Microsoft''s strategy (or lack of strategy) regarding XML.

Larry''s post reads as follows:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s been lots of interesting commentary about Microsoftâ€™s recent decision to submit its Office Document Formats to ECMA for â€œopen standardization.â€ Thatâ€™s good news, depending, of course, on the details. </p>\r\n\r\nBut this is even better news: Microsoft has also promised that â€œit will not seek to enforce any of its patent claims necessary to conform to the technical specifications for the Microsoft Office 2003 XML Reference Schemas.â€ </p>\r\n\r\nThis shows some hope to the complex of issues around patents affecting software in the land of Microsoft. Even opponents of software and business method patents will advise companies to secure them â€” given others can as well. But behavior like this goes a long way to neutralizing the negative effect of such patents. No license. No agreement. Just an unequivocal promise â€” at least with respect to those who donâ€™t sue Microsoft.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nA quick read of this may suggest a more favorable review than a more careful review will indicate:  he acknowledges that the devil of the Ecma tender will be in the details, takes the future promise at face value, and then finally comments not on the specifics of the covenant, but on the mechanism of covenants not to sue generically, in contrast to complex licenses. </p>\r\n\r\n<b>Wednesday: </b> The Computer & Communications Industry Association (or <a href=''http://www.ccianet.org/''>CCIA</a>) sends a letter of protest to Herald Theist, President of Emma International.  That letter reads in part as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nTomorrow you will hold a preliminary vote on the proposed establishment of an Emma International standard around Microsoftâ€™s Office XML formats. On behalf of the Computer & Communications Industry Association and the Open Source and Industry Alliance, I respectfully request that you reject this proposalâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\nNo one begrudges any company the opportunity to make new versions of its products compatible with previous ones. The larger problem is the frustration that arises when businesses, consumers and governments must deal with â€œstandardsâ€ that are simple ratifications of what almost any proprietary software company would do in the normal course of businessâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the proposal before you does not meet basic principles of openness. It provides no assurances as to third-party access to or implementation of the standard. The proposal does not call for open management and control. In fact, it indicates that no one can introduce or remove features from Office 12 save Microsoft itself. There is no \r\nassurance that the Microsoft will actually support the standard should it disagree with actions taken by Emmaâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\nBecause open standards are by definition controlled by no single party, they facilitate interoperation among suppliers, partners, peers, and customers. Standards such as HTML, XML and TCP/IP maximize choice, minimize production costs and make competition work for customers of all kinds. In the long run, market forces work better, and vital records can be preserved forever -- not just for two or three product cycles. This proposed standard assures none of these things.</p>\r\n\r\nMr. Theis, the world is at a crossroads. Much, if not most technological progress today takes place in a milieu of open standards. Rather than approve this proposal as is, we urge you to insist on true openness. You should demand more of any vendor that brings a standard to your committee. If Microsoftâ€™s proposal is to have any meaning at all, \r\ncompetitive vendors and open source developers must have a strong role in its development. Microsoft, likewise, should promise to develop within the confines of the standard it puts forward, and should license any intellectual property within Office 12 so that all developers can be assured that their software licenses will not conflict with Microsoftâ€™s. \r\nOnce again we urge you to reject the proposal.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe letter is signed by Ed Black, President & CEO of CCIA, and the full text of the letter can be read <a href=''www.ccianet.org/filings/ip/ECMA_letter_12705.pdf''>here</a> . </p>\r\n\r\nClearly, things are not settling down.  Nor have the supporters of ODF opted to sit back quietly and be spectators rather than active participants in influencing where all will eventually come out.</p>\r\n\r\nThursday should prove to be an even more interesting day, as Ecma makes a decision that will not only affect the future of open document formats, but may say much about the future of Ecma as a venue for effective and respected standard setting as well. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Or, as my contact phrased it, "<b>None</b> of the questions raised in the community, by IBM or by you in your blog were answered today.  We still don''t have any reason, for example, to think that proprietary extensions could not be used with the formats.  In short, the status quo has been maintained as far as information or answers to questions are concerned." </p>\r\n\r\nHe also stressed that IBM''s vote should be considered to be not a vote <i>against</i> Microsoft but a ballot <i>for</i> open standards.</p>\r\n\r\nSo there we have it.  A "standards" committee formed to standardize a single vendor''s product, and only one vote against proceeding as requested by Microsoft. </p>\r\n\r\nGiven that there was so little opposition to the vote, one would assume that things would proceed rapidly and smoothly from here, since much of the normal give and take of standard setting â€“ what existing implementations should we accommodate?  What features merit inclusion and what don''t? What vendors'' future product plans should be facilitated? What future capabilities might the community need?  What creativity could be utilized to improve the technology? â€“ all of these will not only be moot, but will be out of scope for the committee as well. </p>\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Microsoft has chosen its venue quite well.  It has also shown its hand at the last possible moment to limit the possibility of organized external opposition, and will be driving the process hard to end true to its beginning.  </p>\r\n\r\nAll of which makes the contrast to ODF rather stark: in contrast, that standard was developed by a community process that decided what should and should not be included and which had no constraints imposed upon it by anyone; it is supported today in multiple product offerings; it is not only open source friendly, but already implemented in open source; it is already in the voting queue at ISO; and it has no dependency, formal or de facto, that will require it to track any individual vendor''s product in the future. </p>\r\n\r\nThere''s no denying that Microsoft is a great strategist and extremely thorough in its execution, and therefore likely to succeed in its effort to produce an Ecma branded standard . The question is, when that standard comes out with the Ecma rubber stamp at the top, will the market adopt it to the exclusion of ODF?  </p>\r\n\r\nI don''t know.  But I hope that everyone will work to make sure that the flow of information is full, accurate and timely between now and then, so that the market can make up its mind in the most informed and intelligent a manner possible.  </p>\r\n\r\nI do know this, however: if the market wants a truly open standard, the information to date is telling me that the market wants ODF.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

But the story won''t be over until the <i>Globe</i> tells its readers why it took it upon itself to instigate this fruitless investigation to begin with.', '<i>Note:  this is a long blog entry (even for me).  It covers three elements: a story by the Boston <i>Globe</i> announcing that Peter Quinn has been cleared; a review of the <i>Globe''s</i> role in causing the inquiry into Quinn to be launched; and a letter to the paper''s Ombudsman, requesting an inquiry into the propriety of the <i>Globe/s</i> reporting of this story.</i></p> \r\n\r\nThe Boston <i>Globe </i> reports today that Peter Quinn has been <a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/12/10/review_backs_trips_by_technology_chief/''>cleared</a> in an investigation into whether his travel to trade conferences had received proper approval.  The article reads in part as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Romney administration''s chief technology officer did not violate conflict-of-interest standards or other rules when he took 12 out-of-state trips to attend conferences during the past year without obtaining the written approval of his boss, according to a review by the governor''s budget chiefâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\nAlso, Fehrnstrom said that while sponsors of many of the conferences included computer software companies, Quinn had assured Trimarco that none of the firms are currently state vendors or are bidding on state business.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe article also confirms Quinn''s statements that his superior, Eric A. Kriss, who was then secretary of administration and finance, had not only verbally approved each of the trips in advance, but had told him that completing any paperwork in connection with the travel was unnecessary, " because he felt that the reason that the regulation had been put in place originally -- the fiscal crisis of the mid-1990s had cut out all state-funded travel -- had expired."  It was the completion of this paperwork (only) that had been called into question, and not the travel itself.  </p>\r\n\r\nAs noted in my earlier entry, Massachusetts has an opportunity to showcase its innovation in technology through Quinn''s policy proposal, or to attack the messenger as part of an internal squabble.  The same point is implied in a quote in today''s <i>Globe</i>, and has been made in letters to the Commonwealth by both IBM and Sun Microsystems: <blockquote>\r\n \r\n''''I knew of every trip that Peter was taking, and I approved them all," Kriss said. ''''He was in demand at most of these [conferences] because of the path towards [open format] that we were taking. People in other states were anxious to hear about the Massachusetts experience." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo ends one sordid little story in the long unseemly saga of Massachusetts politics.  But the story does not answer all of the questions that this incident raises, some of which may be much more significant than Peter Quinn''s travel documentation: what caused this fruitless inquiry to be launched in the first place, and was the reporting of the <i>Globe</i> responsibly conducted? </p>\r\n\r\nIn fact, the investigation was instigated in response to inquiries to the State Government made by the <i>Globe</i> itself, as it reported on <a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/26/romney_administration_reviewing_trips_made_by_technology_chief/''>November 26</a>.  Both articles were written by <i>Globe</i> staff writer Steven Kurkjian.  As noted in my earlier entry, titled <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1771''>City on a Hill or Tammany Hall?</a>, the inquiries were made by <i>Globe</i> staff writer Steve Kurkjian concurrent with moves by Senator Pacheco and others in State Government to curtail Quinn''s ability to set rules for proper management of the IT needs of the Executive Agencies for which he is responsible.</p>\r\nThe question that remains, is why did the <i>Globe</i> make these inquiries, and did it conduct the degree of investigation prior to reporting the story that is consistent with responsible journalism?</p>\r\nThe reason these questions are relevant is because a paper can either be the source of invaluable information that might not otherwise come to light, or it can be used by enemies of a person â€“ or of a policy â€“ that are currently under attack.  When a controversy is in process, I believe that it is incumbent upon a journalist to be especially cautious regarding sources that can be expected to have an axe to grind, and to subject those allegations to particular scrutiny before proceeding to make them public.</p>\r\nIn this case, what did the <i>Globe</i> do before going to press with the story?  According to today''s story, "phone calls to Kriss''s home [in connection with the earlier story] seeking comment at the time were not returned."  The story does not say for how long the reporter tried to contact him, or whether it was known whether Kriss was even in town on Thanksgiving weekend, or why the <i>Globe</i> felt that it needed to rush the story to print before making further efforts to learn whether it indeed had a story to report at all.</blockquote>\r\nAndy Oram, an O''Reilly Media editor did manage to reach Kriss on the day that the first </i>Globe</i> story came out.  Here''s what the <i>Globe</i> reporter <a href=''http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8566''>would have learned</a> if he had held his story until he was able to do the same:<blockquote>\r\nI managed to reach Quinn''s former boss, Eric Kriss, which the Globe did not. (Choosing to break a story over Thanksgiving weekend, when protagonists are on vacation and government offices that could answer questions are closed, definitely does not contribute to clarity.)\r\nKriss, whom I know because he''s contacted me with a book idea earlier, pointed out that: <blockquote>\r\n-  Most of Quinn''s trips occurred after Massachusetts made the decision to adopt OpenDocument. There is no possibility that the trips would influence the decision that had already been made. </br>\r\n-  While some two-way communication occurs at any conference--and is beneficial to the public--the primary purpose of the trips were to let Massachusetts government tell the rest of the world what it was doing. </br>\r\n-  Far from being junkets, these trips were normally squeezed in on weekends around his normal duties and represented a contribution of his free time to the community. </blockquote></blockquote>\r\nIn other words, the reporter would have learned exactly what the investigation would learn: that there had been no impropriety, and that there was no story to report.</p>\r\nThe more troubling question is, why did Kurkjian wake up one morning and decide to look into Quinn''s travel documentation at all, among all of the other stories and areas of inquiry available to him at that time?</p>\r\nThat''s something I''d very much like to know.  As it happens, the <i>Globe</i>, like a number of other papers, has an ombudsman, and his name is <a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/ombudsman/chacon_bio/''>Richard ChacÃ³n</a>.  His email address is ombud@globe.com, and his number is (617)929-3020; he also has a separate voicemail number: (617)939-3022.  </p>\r\n Today I sent him the following questions by email:</p>\r\n\r\nDear Mr. ChacÃ³n:</p>\r\n\r\nI refer you to two stories by Steve Kurkjian, one appearing on November 26 and one on December 9, relating to the travel documentation of Peter Quinn, the CIO of the Commonwealth.  Currently, as reported by the <i>Globe</i> in several stories, Mr. Quinn, and a policy that his department, the Information Technology Division, are being criticized by Senator Pacheco, Secretary Galvin and Microsoft, among others.  They are also being applauded by a large number of people, companies and governments around the world.  </p>\r\n\r\nIn the first of the two stories I refer to above, titled <a href='' http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/26/romney_administration_reviewing_trips_made_by_technology_chief/''>Romney administration reviewing trips made by technology chief</a>, Mr. Kurkjian reports that he made inquiries into the travel of Peter Quinn which resulted in an investigation being launched by the State into the same topic. </p>\r\n\r\nIn the second story, titled <a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/12/10/review_backs_trips_by_technology_chief/''> Review backs trips by technology chief\r\nNo conflict found for aide</a>, also by Mr. Kurkjian, Mr. Quinn is reported to have been cleared.  The article also reports that he was cleared through the testimony of a person, Eric Kriss, who Mr. Quinn had told Mr. Kurkjian prior to November 26 could substantiate his story.  </p>\r\n\r\nMr. Kurkjian, however, went to press over the Thanksgiving weekend with a story that was damaging to Mr. Quinn''s reputation before meeting with success in reaching Mr. Kriss.  Had he done so, as indicated by today''s story, he would have found that there was no need for an investigation, and indeed, no story to report at all.</p>\r\n\r\nGiven the controversy surrounding the possible displacement of Microsoft products by the policy that Mr. Quinn proposed, I believe that it is important for you to address the following questions, in order to determine whether the <i>Globe</i> was used by opponents of Mr. Quinn or his policy to pursue the ends of any such opponents, and if so, whether the <i>Globe</i> followed appropriate journalistic practices in order to avoid this outcome:</p>\r\n\r\n1.  Did Mr. Kurkjian decide to look into Mr. Quinn''s travel on his own, or was this suggested to him by someone? </p>\r\n\r\n2.  If there was a source, who was that source?</p>\r\n\r\n3.  If there was a source, was that source inside the Massachusetts government or outside?</p>\r\n\r\n4.  If the source was inside the government, were the disclosures made to Mr. Kurkjian made in violation of any State policy?</p>\r\n\r\n5.  If the source was outside the government, did the source have any affiliations that would lead him or her to have an interest in the disparagement of Mr. Quinn?</p>\r\n\r\n6.  Why did Mr. Kurkjian not wait to run the story until he was able to reach Mr. Kriss, who Mr. Kurkjian knew could confirm or disprove the basis for the story?</p>\r\n\r\n7.  Was this story, and the investigation behind it, in compliance with the <i>Globe''s</i> policies?</p>\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of the information technology policy that underlies this story, which is literally being watched from around the world and has generated hundreds of articles in the world press, I hope that you will undertake to answer these questions. </p>\r\n\r\nBy way of disclosure, I have been reporting on this story for several months at my blog, and have reproduced this letter there in an entry that will be read by thousands of visitors over the next several days.  The address of that entry is: http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1805\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nI am also an attorney, and one of my clients is the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Systems (OASIS), which developed the OpenDocument standard that lies at the heart of the discussions that are going on within the State House.

Not only are most on-line stories limited to one to two screens of text (using whatever space is left between the advertising), but prevailing rules of journalism dictate that a good deal of what space is available will be spent in a very predictable way: headline, subtitle, opening sentences, expansion of theme, quote from source consistent with story line, statement of counter position, closing quote from source counter to story line or "good closing quote".  \r\n<p>The result is that while print journals abound with longer, more analytical pieces, in-depth on-line analysis is increasingly becoming the province of bloggers and those specialty sites that place fewer constraints on their authors.\r\n<p>It will be no surprise to many that as the recipient of this first award I have selected:\r\n<p><center><b>David Berlind - <a href='' http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/''>Between the Lines</a> (ZDNet.com)</b></center>\r\n<p>David has previously been honored by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), which presented him with its Presidents Award for Journalism in 2003.  Unlike most journalists, he was an IT professional before becoming a professional writer.  His Between the Lines blog (a venue shared with co-author Dan Farber) has consistently covered not only open standards and open source, but more recently the interplay, and sometimes clash, between those two disciplines.  I haven''t agreed with David on every position that he has taken (the opposite is also true), but his commitment and passion for covering open standards and open source is unquestioned, as has been his contribution towards bringing important issues to light and into public dialogue.\r\n<p><b><i>Best Community Site or Blog (Non-Profit)</b></i>\r\n<p>Blogs and community sites that focus on particular domains or issues have become an increasingly important route by which news can reach the public that would otherwise be neglected by, or unknown to, the formal media.

The abiding question it raises is this:  Why would any sane person want to <i>do</i> this?', 'As has been widely reported, including in this blog (see, for example, <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1699''>The Fix is in on ODF</a> and <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1745''>A Nasty Little Turf Battle on Beacon Hill</a>), an amendment was recently added to an economic bill in the Massachusetts Senate that would, if enacted, transfer control over most meaningful state IT decisions to a new politically appointed "task force".  The bill to which that amendment is attached has not yet been adopted, but may be early in the New Year, if not sooner.</p>\r\n\r\nOn November 16, General Counsel to the Commonwealth''s Information Technology Division (ITD) Linda Hamel released a legal brief substantiating State CIO Peter Quinn and the ITD''s legal authority to adopt ODF.  You can find that brief <a href=''http://consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/11-16-05.php''>here</a>.  I have now received a copy of a challenge that Ms. Hamel has also prepared, which will form a part of the Legislative Information Package relating to the proposed amendment, which is formally referred to as "Floor number 185, as amended on November 16, 2005."  The challenge is titled " A Revolutionary Amendment to Transfer Control of Information Technology from the Governor and the Municipalities to the Secretary of the Commonwealth."</p>\r\n\r\nIt would take more time and space than I have currently available to summarize the 17 single-spaced pages of closely reasoned argument and information that Linda has crafted, but having given the document a reading, there is one abiding question I am left with, and that is this:</p>\r\n\r\nWhy would any sane person want to <i>do</i> this?</p>\r\n\r\nPreviously, I have written mostly about the power politics and industry pressures that led to the proposed amendment, rather than spending a great deal of time on the practicalities and consequences of the amendment in question.  For example, I have previously noted that the amendment would not only take control of procurement and standards policy away from the State agencies directly involved in architecting, buying, deploying and training, but would also take the same power away from the heretofore autonomous municipalities of Massachusetts as well â€“ exercising hegemony, in other words, over thousands of town halls, libraries, first responders, and much more. </p>\r\n\r\nWhat exactly would that mean?  Here''s what Ms. Hamel offers as an introduction to her piece:<blockquote><i>\r\n\r\nImagine a world in which the Town of Reading has to get permission from the Secretary of the Commonwealth to issue cell phones to its employees.  The Department of Public Health has to get permission from the Secretary of the Commonwealth before providing information about AIDS-related health issues to the public on its website . . .Viruses proliferate throughout networks, continuously shutting down access for thousands of state employees, because the Governor cannot  issue network security standards without getting permission from both the Secretary of the Commonwealth and a task force that neither the municipalities nor the Governor  control.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd who would make up this task force?  That would be two industry representatives (one with a telecom background, and one with IT experience) and the balance being the following State officials: the CIO, the Supervisor of Records, the Archivist, the Treasurer, the Secretary of State, and the Auditor (or, in the case of the last three officers, his or her designee).  In short, there would be an eight person task force, only three members of which would be sure to have any relevant knowledge at all, and all of whom would have full time, or more than full time, jobs in addition to their duties on the task force.  </p>\r\n\r\nWhat would the task force be responsible for supervising?  The following excerpts hardly do justice to the reality described in greater detail in Ms. Hamel''s contribution to the legislative package:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts is a 23 billion dollar enterpriseâ€¦Executive Department agencies employ roughly 1700 technologists at the agency level, while the Information Technology Division (â€œITDâ€), the central agency assigned authority over the Executive Departmentâ€™s use of information technology, employs an additional 250â€¦ the Executive Departmentâ€¦employs roughly 55,000â€¦. ITD manages and maintains the Commonwealthâ€™s wide area network; runs a state of the art data center that hosts almost all of the Commonwealthâ€™s mission critical IT systems; hosts the Commonwealthâ€™s e-government portal, Mass.gov; and operates enterprise IT systems, including a central e-mail system, a central human resources system, and a data warehouse for the Commonwealthâ€™s electronic financial and human resources data. It also develops enterprise-wide applications; operates telecommunications facilities; makes recommendations to the Secretary of ANF for the distribution of approximately $80,000,000 in information technology bond funding annually; sponsors a number of enterprise wide IT related groups such as the Enterprise Security Board, the WebMasters Group, the TechLaw Practice Group, and the Enterprise Architecture Council; and has issued hundreds of individual standards related to the acquisition and use of information technology by Executive Department agencies.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, over what domains would this largely non-technical task force have authority?  According to the proposed amendment, the subjects of its control would include: <blockquote>	</i>\r\n\r\n(1) procurement policies by commonwealth agencies, constitutional offices, and other government entities concerning computer hardware and software, cellular telephones, personal data accessories, and other information technology devices; (2) format and content of web pages maintained by commonwealth agencies, constitutional offices, and other government entities; and (3) software standards governing commonwealth agencies, constitutional offices, and other government entities. </p>\r\n\r\nIn offering recommendations, the task forceâ€™s analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the following considerations: (1) cost-benefit analysis of proposed policies or practices; (2) security of proposed policies or practices from viruses, hacking, and other breaches; (3) the extent to which the proposed policy or practice results in user-friendly applications for commonwealth employees, business entities, and members of the public; and (4) proposals and options to facilitate more efficient transactions between commonwealth entities and the public, including on-line transactions. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nMs. Hamel is not sanguine about the ability of the Commonwealth to continue to operate, if it is subject to the constraints of the task force.  She notes:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nNone of ITDâ€™s current operational responsibilities can be fulfilled if ITD must await the decision of the ITETF [the new task force] or the Secretaryâ€™s Supervisor of Public Records before adopting or implementing information technology policies, practices or standards, or the creation or storage of record.  Today, IT and the use of electronic records permeate every aspect of the Executive Departmentâ€™s activitiesâ€¦. State employees employ sophisticated IT from desktop PCs and complex software systems to cell phones, handheld devices, laptops, notebook computers, Palm Pilots, and Blackberry devices. ITD simply could not function if every decision it made about information technology policy, practices, and standards had to be cleared by the ITETF or the Secretaryâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for ITD, in its capacity as chief IT organization for the Executive Department, to manage a 21st century IT environment without having the discretion and authority to issue policies and standards that profoundly affect the creation and storage of public records within the Executive Department by Executive Department agenciesâ€¦.   </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe document goes on to point out that, not surprisingly, that the IT professionals that currently manage the Commonwealth''s IT and telecom resources are better versed, capable and likely to properly decide what needs to be done. </p>\r\n\r\nThe second thrust of the document is to analyze the degree to which the amendment would "radically reorganize State government," and I may provide detail on what Ms. Hamel has to say in this regard on another day.  But my message for now, both analytically as well as from the perspective of a Massachusetts resident (which I am), comes back to the same, simple, question I noted above with alarm:  </p>\r\n\r\nWhy would any sane person want to <i>do</i> this?</p>\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Now where have I heard something like <i>that</i> before? </p>\r\n\r\nBesides being coincidental, the story illustrates yet again how high the stakes can be in standards battles, the degree of strategy and alliance building that is employed by the combatants, and the lack of coherence in the global standard setting infrastructure that allows this type of "forum shopping" to persist, permitting one faction to end-run another rather than work harder to arrive at a single, universally supported standard that would be more beneficial to the end user. </p>\r\n \r\nThis isn''t a story that I''ve been following, or have any special insight into, so I''ll try and pull together without comment what appears to be the story.  </p>\r\n\r\nAs reported in the <a href=''http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174907237''>EETimes</a>, two camps arrived at a deadlock within an IEEE task group formed to develop an ultrawideband (UWB) standard.  Intel, HP, Microsoft, Philips, Sony, Texas Instruments and Samsung are prominent members of one camp, which is supported by the <a href=''http://www.wimedia.org/en/index.asp''>Wi-Media Alliance</a>, a consortium with a very large <a href=''http://www.wimedia.org/en/about/ourmembers.asp?id=abt''>membership</a> that is independent of the IEEE, but promotes standards that emerge from the IEEE technical process, as well as specifications that it creates.  Critically, it also provides certification tests for wireless products.<p>\r\n\r\nThe other camp also has its own support group, called the <a href=''http://www.uwbforum.org/''>UWB Forum</a>, and also has a large and varied <a href=''http://www.uwbforum.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=59''>membership</a>, including Motorola and Freescale, the Motorola spinout.  </p>\r\n\r\nAs reported at <a href=''http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/news/article.php/3569596''>WiFi Planet</a>, here''s how things evolved: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n[The IEEE 802.15 Task Group 3a] was charged with creating the standard for a high data rate wireless personal area network (WPAN) technology called ultrawideband (UWB). A split formed in early 2004 when the MBOA Group (which later merged with WiMedia) left the table, blaming Motorola for preventing MBOA from getting the 75 percent vote needed to become the standard. Motorola and its offshoot Freescale Semiconductor formed the UWB Forum, whose members prefer the technology approach called Direct Sequence-UWB (DS-UWB). The two groups have been at odds ever since. </p>\r\nGoing with Ecma instead of IEEE gives WiMedia an international standard -- it just happens to have a headquarters in Europe instead of the United Statesâ€¦.Perhaps it helps that Freescale does not belong, though WiMedia is quick to point out that Freescale could have joined Ecma at any time and has been well aware of what WiMedia was working towardâ€¦.</p> \r\nThat doesn''t mean IEEE isn''t looking at high-speed WPANs anymore, but at the January IEEE meeting, [Wi-Media President and Intel employee Stephen] Wood says, WiMedia members will seek to terminate the work of the 802.15.3a group. If the members can get a 75 percent supermajority vote for the withdrawal of the task group''s PAR -- the Project Authorization Request -- then all work there would be done. </p>\r\nIf they don''t get the vote, it''s unknown what would happen, but it''s likely that the UWB Forum and WiMedia would keep things deadlocked for an indeterminate amount of time, just as they have for the last two yearsâ€¦.</p>  \r\nDoes this do away with the fight for UWB mindshare? Wood thinks it should, especially because he believes the term "ultrawideband" shouldn''t be used at all. "From a consumer perspective, we hope ''ultrawideband'' is never heard," says Wood. "We expect ''Bluetooth'' and ''Wireless USB'' to be heard, but not UWB. That should play only at the silicon and manufacturer level." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nHardball?  Absolutely.  Standards battles can bear enormous stakes, with literally billions of dollars up for grabs.  The process is frequently not pretty, the motivations are never philanthropic, and spin is the norm rather than the exception.  What someone says and what someone is doing are often not congruent.</p>\r\n\r\nSomething good to keep in mind, whatever universe you happen to find yourself in.</p>\r\n\r\n<i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The intro to the FAQ reads as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe have been gratified to see the general positive reaction to the Microsoft move to standardize the OpenXML document formats. Public sector organizations and many other customers as well as those in the technology industry continue to praise this development as they become aware of the details. The announcement was very straightforward, but as we have spoken with more organizations we are collecting the questions that arise about the details and implications of the announcement.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe page also promises regular updating, to "make sure that everyone has access to more and more information." </p>\r\n\r\nThe answers you will find range from expected, to genuinely reassuring, to what I believe are clearly inaccurate statements about ODF.  The highlights are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n1.	Microsoft has clarified some important points relating to its covenant not to sue:  no license will be required, and a "conformant" implementation does not mean that the entire specification must be implemented. However, this also means that extensions will be permitted.</p>\r\n\r\n2.  Microsoft has confirmed that the same covenant not to sue that it has offered regarding the current version of Office will also apply to Office 12 and to the eventually approved Ecma standard.</p>\r\n\r\n3.	 Based upon what I have been told in interviews in the past, Sun''s role in the development and relating to the release of ODF, and the development of ODF itself, have been blatantly misrepresented.  I would be surprised if Sun does not make a strong statement in response, and hope that they will do so. </p>\r\n\r\nWith the flagrant exception of the ODF statements, most of the answers are reassuring, and some are meaningful.  But the gratuitous and false statements about Sun, ODF and OASIS add a jarring note that represents at best a PR gaffe, and at worst an indication of the degree to which Ecma may allow Microsoft to write the script for the standards process to be conducted in its name.</p>\r\n\r\nHere is my initial take on the more important information to be gleaned from the FAQ, by category of information.  I may add additional analysis at a later date in this, or in a new blog entry:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n1.	Text confirming the tight focus on producing a standard that is locked on Microsoft Office: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nQ:  Why has Microsoft taken existing document formats and moved to standardize them with industry partners, rather than develop something new in a more collaborative process?</p>\r\n\r\nA.  Organizations all over the world have asked Microsoft to insure that their valuable investments in billions of documents are protected and are made even more valuable by enabling conversion to modern open XML-based formats.</p>\r\nBy taking this approach to standardization with industry participation and support in Ecma International, organizations around the world will have the immediate benefit of both backward compatibility for existing documents and the long-term benefit of a forward-looking open industry consensus process. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nOther Q&A''s stress the degree to which the submission is intended to optimize the user experience for those using Office.</p>\r\n\r\n2.	Mildly reassuring statements such as the following:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nQ:  How open or closed will the Ecma International process be for the OpenXML formats?</p>\r\n\r\nA:  â€¦The Ecma organization will focus on fully documenting the formats to enable further standards work, to insure cross-platform and multiple tool support and to meet widespread industry requirements and utility. Then it will go still beyond this startup mode under the stewardship of Ecma member organizations working on the technical committee. We expect competitors, partners, and customers to embrace the OpenXML formats as a result.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis makes the right noises, but it is not clear how much flexibility will be allowed in the ongoing work, given the tight initial focus on locking on Microsoft Office.  It would seem odd to show so much commitment to optimizing the format for Microsoft in the beginning, and then ignore those "billions of pages" of documents in future releases of the same standard.</p>\r\n\r\n3.	Outright untruths:  I am outright shocked by a portion shown below of the answer given to the following question:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nQ.  Why is Microsoft offering a new standard, rather than simply supporting the file format for the Open Office product (sometimes called ODF)?</p>\r\n\r\nA.  Sun submitted the OpenOffice formats to a small committee in the OASIS organization. The record shows that there were almost no material changes to the OpenOffice specification from the time it was submitted to the time it was approved by the working group at OASIS. Sun timed the release of the OpenDocument standard in conjunction with the OpenOffice 2.0 release. The OASIS committee did not focus on the requirements, constraints, and experiences of Microsoft customers.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom what I have been told in interviews I have personally conducted in the past, every contention (but one) in this statement is false.  Moreover, the statement about the composition of the formats going into the process and coming out can easily be tested. </p>\r\n\r\nHere''s an extract from a story I wrote in <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>September</a>, based on interviews with those in the know at Microsoft, OASIS, Sun, Peter Quinn, and management of a trade association critical of the Massachusetts decision.   I''ll do my own Q&A here, using excerpts from that article as answers:<blockquote>\r\n\r\nQ:  How small was the "small committee?"</p>\r\n\r\nA.	OASIS chartered what was originally called the OpenOffice XML Format Technical Committee (TC) in December of 2002.  The original members of the TC were nothing if not diverse: Arbortext, Boeing, Corel, CSW Informatics, Drake Certivo, National Archive of Australia, New York State Office of the Attorney General, Society of Biblical Literature, Sony, Stellent and Sun Microsystems.  Later, other organizations joined the committee, including KOffice and IBM, each of which has created its own office suite that supports OpenDocument.  Some, but not all, of the suites that support OpenDocument are based upon open source software developed by OpenOffice.org, which continues to offer an open source office suite that is committed to compliance with the OpenDocument OASIS Standard.</p>\r\n\r\nQ.	Is it a fact that " there were almost no material changes to the OpenOffice specification from the time it was submitted to the time it was approved by the working group at OASIS?"</p>\r\n\r\nA.	The new TC did not simply begin where OpenOffice.org left off, but instead spent more than a year analyzing the existing format in detail in order to determine what to retain, what to change, and what to add, thereby ensuring that the finally adopted standard would be vendor neutral, application independent, and as interoperable as possible.  More than a year of additional work was required to take the resulting format to a third and final vote by the TC in March of 2005.  The draft standard was also posted for public review during the process, and the many comments received from non-members were reviewed for merit and inclusion by the TC.  The resulting OpenDocument 1.0 was approved by the full membership of OASIS two months later, becoming an OASIS Standard in May of 2005. </p>\r\n\r\nQ.	Did "Sun time the release of the OpenDocument standard in conjunction with the OpenOffice 2.0 release?"</p>\r\n\r\nB.	A.  .  The resulting OpenDocument 1.0 was approved by the full membership of OASIS two months later, becoming an OASIS Standard in May of 2005. \r\n[Note: OASIS is an organization with hundreds of members.] </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe one statement that I assume is at least partially true is this: "The OASIS committee did not focus on the requirements, constraints, and experiences of Microsoft customers."  This would have been difficult to accomplish, since Microsoft, although it was an OASIS member, chose not to become a member of the ODF Technical Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n4.	Statements on Licensing:  Here are the most important statements:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere is no longer really a license that people need to sign up for in any way â€” No one needs to sign anything or even reference anything. Anyone is free to use the formats as they wish and do not need to make any mention or reference to Microsoft. Anyone can use or implement these formats to both read and write the formats with their technology, code, solution, etc.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis was expected, but not completely clear from the Microsoft Website.<blockquote>\r\n \r\nTransferability of solutions and "GPL Compatibility" â€” If someone wants to build a solution that works with our formats, they are free to do so without worrying about patents or licenses associated with our formats. The concerns raised with our previous license about attribution and sub-licensing are now eliminated. Because the General Public License (GPL) is not universally interpreted the same way by everyone, we canâ€™t give anyone a legal opinion about how our language relates to the GPL or other OSS licenses, but we believe we have removed the principal objections that people found with our prior license in a very simple and clear way.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAside from the use of the word "principal" (which may not really mean anything worrisome) this is reassuring.<blockquote>\r\n\r\nSubsets, supersets, and ''conformance'' â€” Anyone is free to work with a subset of the specifications, and anyone is free to create extensions to the specifications. A ''conformant'' use is simply one that does not modify the specification. Of course subsets and supersets may create incompatibilities with other uses of the specifications and we want to provide some guidance on this topic in the future, but this will be guidance and not a mandate.

State House, attending a meeting called "An Open Forum on the Future of Electronic Formats for the Commonwealth," which is focusing on the current controversy in the Massachusetts legislature over the adoption of ODF and/or the Microsoft XML Reference Schema.  I will be reporting here in real-time as the meeting proceeds.  I won''t be trying to take a rough transcript this time, but will try to summarize as many of the presentations'' key points and questions as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about 100 people in the formal, ornate, high-ceilinged Senate Reading Room.  The crowd includes State legislators, corporate employees (many from IBM, Microsoft and Sun), press, accessibility advocates, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presenters are:<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As legislative hosts:  Senator Jack Hart, Rep. Dan Bosley (Chairs of the Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Palfrey, Executive Director of the Berkman Center on Internet and Society, Harvard Law School (Palfrey hosted an earlier invitation-only meeting with some of the same speakers about six weeks ago). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Sutor, IBM VP of Standards and Open Source</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Yates, Microsoft General Manager of Information Worker Business Strategy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Quinn, Mass. CIO and head of the Information Technology Division (ITD)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linda Hamel, General Council, ITD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Sproull, Sun Microsystems</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judy Brewer, Web Accessibility Initiative, W3C</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Cote, Mass. Secretary of State''s Office</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Senator Hart briefly welcomes all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his opening remarks, <i><b>John Palfrey</b></i> expresses his pride that Massachusetts is tackling the issues, and notes his bias towards a "free and open Internet,"  and discloses that IBM, Sun and other interested parties support his Center.  He then identifies the "elephant in the living room," which is the commercial significance of the current debate, and urges that the elephant be evicted so that serious policy matters may be properly addressed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palfrey notes the importance of openness and availability of information, and setting up an ecosystem where information can be accessed over time, including by those with disabilities.  Interoperability is crucial, and admittedly costs are significant as well - but the upfront switching costs are a "red herring" - long-term costs should be the measure, and, frankly, Massachusetts is not at the forefront of eGovernment today - an investment is warranted. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, he notes that innovation is an important issue here, and that what the State does should be consistent with the well-earned reputation for innovation of Massachusetts.  Small firms can benefit from the ITD''s policy, and innovation is how that can be done. In that regard, technologies should be "generative," meaning that citizens can access, use, and build on the State''s resources.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrapping up, the world is watching - Massachusetts is the canary in the coalmine - and we''ve got to get this right.</p>\r\n\r\n<<p>i><b>Rep. Dan Bosley</i></b> now introduces the panel, inviting each panelist to give a brief introduction, including answering the question, "Is it important that the Commonwealth adopt an open format?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><b>Bob Sutor</i></b> leads off, commending Mass. on its open process in evolving this IT policy, and asks them to maintain the integrity of that process. He notes also the importance of having a multi-vendor environment, which will lead to greater innovation than a vendor-controlled standard - he says to the Commonwealth, "Don''t turn back."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ODF was created to answer the needs and demands of customers - we as a vendor, and others, are committed to serving customer demands - don''t turn back.  Your needs will best be served by running with ODF immediately.  IBM is committed to serving those governments and others that want an open format.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One last time, "Don''t turn back!"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><b>Peter Quinn,</i></b> Mass. State CIO speaks next:  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter begins by reviewing the history of the consideration, review, open examination of, and final adoption of ODF.  Gives examples of needs and challenges, and stresses commitment to addressing accessibility needs - and also announces that if those needs are not met by the announced effectiveness date for ODF implementation (Janurary 1, 2007), then the effective date will be rolled back until that need is met.  Applauds IBM''s efforts in helping meet these needs.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representative <i><b>Corey Atkins</i></b> introduces <i><b>Bob Sproull</i></b>, asking, "What do we have to gain - and lose - from adopting an open format?  What my constituents want is more transparency."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sproull is speaking off the cuff, and endorses and agrees with "everything Bob Sutor said."  He stresses Sun''s commitment to meeting State needs as well.  Uses the openness of the telephony world as an example, and the innovation that this openness has enabled - notes that documents are a form of communication as well - a communication to the future.  Says that we are not in a "breakdown of communication" mode, but we do need to address these needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to the Commonwealth''s questions:  can we deliver?  Yes we can.  And we can make the system flexible, so that it can evolve (like telecom standards do), to meet future needs.  The innovations that this openness will enable will drive the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Atkins next introduces <i><b>Alan Yates</i></b>.\r\n\r\n<p>Appreciates invitation, and acknowledges the need and importance for a public debate - welcomes the opportunity to clear up some of the misconceptions.  Agrees that delivering value to constituencies is in important duty.  Let''s keep the focus on "value," and what value means.  People should be able to choose the best value for the money.  Says that he''s not "particularly arguing with anything that Bob Sproull or Bob Sutor have said about openness," but adds, "can Massachusetts be open to additional choices besides ODF?" which will help avoid ongoing debates, and "public technology sitting at the craps table" hoping that the choice you made is the right one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy can also be used to establish political agendas.  Gives example of Brazil, where he says someone recounted to him how his government "was choosing my software for me."  Public policy should not favor one model over another - proprietary software can be "open" just as open source can.  These are two different business models, and government should be open to both - and to whatever else comes along.  If you do this, you will avoid problems like additional costs; like a lack of accessibility features.  "My message is to open up to more choices."  We are gratified by the reaction to our moving the schema to Ecma, "which is beyond anyone''s question an open process."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XML has been great at enabling openness, but performance can be an issue - you don''t want it to take three minutes to open a spreadsheet.  We also want to be sure that all legacy documents can be opened.  The technology is opening rapidly, and we''ve borrowed from other''s ideas - such as Sun - to make it so that any open source developer can use these formats.  Lawyers will still be arguing over this, I expect, but our covenant is intended to enable the schema to be usable with no concerns.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, Microsoft has never argued against the OpenDocument in any form.  We''re looking forward to helping spur this new era of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Atkins then introduces <i><b>Alan Cote</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cote says "I hate to pour cold water on this," but most documents are destroyed after 10 years.  And almost no paper documents that exist are available for public view right now - and eventually will be destroyed.  This is really all just about records management.  The idea is to make everything available, though.  But note - most documents won''t be affected by this policy.  Legislative and judicial records are closed - and will stay closed.  So my focus is a bit different.  We don''t have a crisis - we don''t have thousands of records that people can''t see.  We don''t have documents on servers that can''t be opened and read - we''ll find a way to make them available.  It doesn''t mean that we''re not working on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>"What we''re fighting for is open access forever at the cheapest cost, and I look forward to working with everyone to achieve that end."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Atkins next introduces <i><b>Judy Brewer</i></b>.\r\n\r\n<p>Brewer reads from a statement, and welcomes the degree of attention that has, and is, being given to accessibility issues.  She disagrees with Cote in that those in State government do have to review all kinds of records - and they therefore have to meet accessibility needs, as there are many state employees with accessibility needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some have proposed that the open approach should aid in permitting others to solve accessibility issues - we''ll see how that works out.  What levels of accessibility do we need?  This has not yet been addressed by this panel (reviews levels).  Agrees that the Massachusetts dialogue is being viewed all over the world - and that includes as regards accessibility issues.  There are questions that need to be answered as the process continues:  has there been an objective review of the issues that need to be addressed with ODF?  Is there a plan for addressing them?  OASIS has announced a Working Group to address these issues, which is gratifying.  But what is their reference, legal or otherwise, for setting their goals? [Asks many other questions more quickly than I can grab them.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I''m hoping that the dialogue here will put increasing focus on "more systematic and ongoing addressing of these problems."</p>\r\n\r\n<p></i></b>Alan Hart </i></b>asks Alan Cote a follow-up question: I hear people asking these same accessibility questions.  How do these needs relate to the decisions that you need to make?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cote:  documents are reviewed to determine how best to preserve them - often they are digitized in multiple formats, which are then converted over time as necessary to keep up with technological evolution. <i>[Cote has said this previously, and it has never made sense to me - wouldn''t he like to solve this problem with a format standard?]</i>  One solution that we are aware of would be to try to make all records available via a Web browser.  If we have a crisis, that crisis is document degradation, due to damp and heat.  I hope that the current process encourages vendors to provide me with solutions to this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hart asks another question:  What system would you recommend, moving forward? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cote:  we do not have a crisis; we need to review the situation, and I can''t recommend a solution at this time. I''m encouraged that we can select a solution "down the road," but that will need to be reviewed down the road as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hart introduces <i><b>Linda Hamel</i></b>.  Thanks legislature for opportunity to have this forum.  Says that she would like to explain what life is like for those inside government right now.  The ODF question implicates all types of laws - accessibility laws - laws giving authority to adopt IT policies - the Advisory Panel - and so on.  All of these are implicated in the process by which the ITD policy was created and adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>States that she has been a General Counsel for a decade, and these are difficult issues to wrestle with in a world of rapidly evolving technology.  Things are changing over night.  But it''s important to note that we are looking for "best value," and not any specific solution.  We look at proprietary products and we look at open source - we don''t have a requirement of one or the other - we are looking for the best value solution in each case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I completely applaud Mr. Cote''s desire to have a better system.  What this is about is document life cycle management.  Some documents not only need to be kept for long periods of time, but they need to be accessed as well.  I agree that there is no crisis today, but more and more documents are created every day, and Microsoft is moving into an XML-based product.  The problems that may cause haven''t hit Alan Cote yet - but the XML Revolution is on the horizon.  If we don''t have a standard for such documents, we have a problem both now and in the future.  When documents do get saved in XML, if they are created in a proprietary XML format, then some will not be able to open them.  If a document is created in a proprietary format, then it might as well not be in electronic form at all, for some citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the birth certificate that we''ve all been using as an example today [Peter Quinn had earlier held one aloft] is needed in 100 years, no one will be able to open it if it''s not in an open format.  If it is, then someone will be able to write the code to open it.  That''s the problem we have on the horizon.  We need to pay attention to these decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Atkins asks a question:  "What about email?"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Yates, speaks first, but first says that he wishes to support Linda Hamel''s concerns about an XML-based future.  It''s going to be work for a while, until all documents become open - there will be a transition period, and during that period, we think that choices will be helpful.  Things may even get worse for a while before they get better.   Long term, things look good.  Short term - things will be tough for awhile as the necessary decisions are made and implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Sutor adds:  this is a fascinating and important topic - we have to have the best standards, and we need to ask the hard questions: will there be default settings, and what will they be?  Mr. Vendor, will you give me guarantees that you will not do this or that?  Will you guarantee that I can participate?  These are the type of questions that are critical.  We can''t risk losing 10 years of history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judy Brewer asks: Alan Cote, can you tell me a bit about the formats that you are using now to address accessibility issues - it sounds like a different model?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Cote:  I don''t think we are; we are following the same model, and watching what can be done and what options may be available to the entire Commonwealth. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Palfrey:  I think that this isn''t really about paper records or philosophical questions.  This is all about what''s happening today, and whether we will be able to access it tomorrow.  My students don''t print anything out anymore - either as a document or as music on a CD - it''s created digitally, and it''s accessed digitally - they''re "digital natives."  How do we meet this problem.  Documents are a legacy issue - we need to get out ahead of this digital environment.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Peter Quinn:  It is difficult to address accessibility issues today; the products aren''t really completely up to the problem.  Myra Berloff  (of the State Office on Disability), would you tell everyone about how we are addressing this?  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myra Berloff says: When we heard about the new policy, I was besieged with email by those with accessibility issues.  People expressed great concern, and not just those that are currently disabled, but also those that are aging and concerned about failing eyesight and other age-related issues.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been a pleasure working with Peter Quinn, and we are committed to a policy of not buying anything that does not provide accessibility.  Our Memorandum of Understanding on this issue does not settle for a mere label of "accessible."  We will look more critically, and also be sure that we buy can transition.  It''s a six page MOU <i>[Is this MOU available anywhere?].</i>  We will be sure not to leave a subset of anyone out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Question from the audience: Bob Prokriff (sp?), President of [couldn''t catch it].  We are a vendor that is working with the National Archive on document preservation, and the single biggest concern they had was that the electronic records archive for the U.S. would not use proprietary formats, for the very issues discussed today.  It is vital that our national records are not saved in a format owned by any single company.  Ask yourself the question:  what would we do if we needed vital documents created on a Wang processor 20 years ago?  I think that the Commonwealth should be applauded for taking the lead among all the states in the Union in adopting this policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen Chow, attorney(Perkins, Smith & Cohen), who states that he was involved in drafting an electronic document record proposal that was preempted by the State stands.  What I''d like to say is that this must be addressed at a number of different levels.  Where you slice the layers matters.  Someone coming in at a different "slice" will not get the same degree of efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Yates speaks to making the right choices along the way as the technical issues are addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Sutor says:  we all agree on the layer that needs to be addressed and standardized.  Vendor choices need to occur at the application level.  Agree on the standard, and do different things at the application level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiawatha Bray, Boston Globe:  Mr. Yates:  The ODF standard already exists; how long will it be before the XML standard is productized and available?  And Mr. Sproul, how long will it be before ODF will be the equal of Office with respect to accessibility?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Yates:  The two standards started from two difference design points: ODF was formed to meet committee requirements, and the XML format was created to work for Office users.  Microsoft must focus on making this work well for Office users.  Some day the two standards are likely to converge - that''s how these things work.  There are people working on converters and filters.  This problem will be solved over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiawatha Bray:  You''re working on a deadline:  will you be ready by January 1, 2007?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Yates: We''re working on multiple deadlines, internal and Ecma.  They each have their own schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Sproull:  Its important to note that because ODF is open, that we can have a lot of help on this - it''s not just Sun.  IBM, Sun and many others are contributing.  And we''re also working on browser solutions as well. Will we meet your deadline?  I don''t know.  Software engineers never want to commit to a shipping deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Sutor:  As you know, we''ve committed to an ODF product now - and we have committed to meeting the Commonwealth''s deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Question from the audience (couldn''t catch name, but works on creating accessibility solutions for the State):  What sort of incentive will there be to train those that will need to know how to use these accessibility solutions?  Know that the blind community isn''t against ODF, but we are against a deployment that could cause the blind to lose the few jobs that we have - the jobless rate is already huge.  \r\n\r\n<p>Dan Bricklin:  If Massachusetts adopted ODF, would that solve your problem?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answer:  Not if the Commonwealth said that we couldn''t use Office because it was too expensive, and wouldn''t train us to use ODF solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Quinn:  We want disability to never be an issue in the Commonwealth again; we want it to be not necessary to even think about this.  And the more this goal permeates the industry, the more solutions there will be, and the lower the prices will be driven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pose a question from the floor, asking Alan Yates to comment on the following exchange from the Microsoft Q&A that was posted on Monday, reading the following outtake from the Microsoft Website:<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Q.  Why is Microsoft offering a new standard, rather than simply supporting the file format for the Open Office product (sometimes called ODF)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.  Sun submitted the OpenOffice formats to a small committee in the OASIS organization. The record shows that there were almost no material changes to the OpenOffice specification from the time it was submitted to the time it was approved by the working group at OASIS. Sun timed the release of the OpenDocument standard in conjunction with the OpenOffice 2.0 release. The OASIS committee did not focus on the requirements, constraints, and experiences of Microsoft customers.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I remind Yates of our interview in <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>September</a>, and of the fact that I had also interviewed OASIS and Sun representatives, and note that from what I have been told in these interviews, that every contention (but one) in this statement is false.  Moreover, the statement about the composition of the formats going into the process and coming out can easily be tested.  I remind him that others have said that the ODF format changed dramatically, that Microsoft is a member of OASIS and knows that Sun could not control when ODF would be released, and that Microsoft could have taken part in the working group to ensure the best fit for Office users, but chose not to participate <i>[ for more detail, see <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1818''>this post</a>]</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Alan Yates:  Well, we were reacting to comments made about the Ecma process, and trying to make the point that both formats started from in-house sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: But do you stand by the statement that there were no real changes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Yates:  I was coming at that from a different point of view; we''ve looked at the comment record, and saw thousands of comments, many from Sun, and I assume that they were reflected in the final code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>[I miss some comments, due to battery problems]</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Forum closed at approximately 12:35 after one or two more question and answer exchanges that I couldn''t catch.

But what is the consensus of the Noosphere on what happened, and on what will happen next?  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know that what is actually said in a meeting, as compared to the consensus that emerges from the collective, barbaric yawp of the commentators (like me), is never congruent.  Over the course of 2 Â½ hours, copious notes get taken that must then be digested into a mere 600 words that must convey not only the key facts, but develop a story line as well in order to hold the interest of busy, on-line visitors through a full one or two minutes of speed reading. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What congeals 24, or at most 48, hours after the fact is therefore usually a single, increasingly sharp (and less accurate) approximation of what really transpired.  Or, if there is controversy, then two images ("our" story and "their" story) coalesce, each of which is, due to the controversy, that much more stridently supported, and inevitably that much more divergent from the truth than if there were but one consensus interpretation.  Years later, historians may go back and "reinterpret" history, supplying yet a third version that may, or may not, more closely approximate reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after the Forum, most of the reporters I bumped into were scratching their heads and wondering what, if any news, had actually emerged during the open meeting.  Many accounts were written, most of which included more of a summary of the story up to now than what was said at the meeting, or turned the words of one speaker or another against them to prove their false intentions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My intention today was to sample the numerous stories that were added to the XML/ODF story stack today.  But after reading them all, I''m not sure that the effort would be sufficiently rewarding to the reader to warrant the effort on either side of the equation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So instead, here''s what the piece of the elephant Iâ€™m holding feels like.  I''ll focus on just a single point that I think came out of the meeting, and which I think actually constitutes news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That point is this:  I think that Microsoft has made a strategic decision that it will be sufficient for its XML Reference Schema to be blessed by Massachusetts â€“ as compared to pressing for a final decision that would *include* its Schema while *excluding* ODF - a significant development in that in September it appeared to me that the goal was to block ODF from adoption at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidence for this conclusion, I would point to the introductory remarks of Alan Yates, Microsoft''s General Manager of Information Worker Business Strategy, and the spokesperson for Microsoft for many months on all things ODF.  You can read Alan''s remarks at Pamela Jones'' <a href=''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051215014700305''>Groklaw site</a>, as transcribed by jtiner from the full podcast recorded by Dan Bricklin, and available at <a href=''http://danbricklin.com/podcast.html#danbcast-2005-12-14-21-48-24'' >his site</a>.  Note the following out takes:<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>What I''m really going to be talking about is Massachusetts actually opening up to more choice and more competition than the current policy has. That''s, I think that''s the fundamental decision that''s before us. Can Massachusetts open up to more choice, additional standards, in order to enable greater value over a period of time? And by doing that, by enabling more choice over a period of time, you avoid the industry warfare that tends to jerk governments around from one month to the next month, to one debate to the next debate to the next debateâ€¦.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with that, I would just like to summarize by saying Microsoft has never argued, you know, really, against the OpenDocument format in any way, shape or form. Microsoft is really concerned about Massachusetts opening up to more choice, more competition.  Competition between standards, we believe, is a very good thing in this rapidly evolving area of technology and by doing so, Massachusetts will, in fact, be a leader around the world in spurring this new level of innovation that''s possible around documents.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Passing for the moment on the interesting comment that Microsoft "has never argued" against ODF in any way (on that contention, see the answer to the <a href='' http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/developers/ecmafaq.mspx ''>third question</a> of the FAQ posted by Microsoft at its Website on December 13) or for the moment remarking on the use of the past tense, it is good news if Microsoft has really decided not to work against ODF adoption (in private as well as in public) in Massachusetts.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I right?  I don''t know for sure, but it''s significant to me that Alan Yates, who has (in my observation) been incredibly good at staying on message would have purposefully and firmly have stated this in his introductory remarks.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that this is very good for two reasons.  First, if Microsoft does not intend to fight the adoption by Massachusetts of ODF, then CIOs in other states will be emboldened to follow the lead of Peter Quinn.  And second, if the manifest destiny of ODF can in fact gather steam, then, as a result, Microsoft must follow through on its pledge to open up Office.  As long as ODF is in the race, then Microsoft must keep its promises, and ODF thus becomes a stalking horse for increased openness on the part of Microsoft.  As long as there are credibly two alternatives in the marketplace, there is an incentive for other vendors to push ODF as hard as they can, which in turn puts that much more pressure on Microsoft not to backslide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So was there news made in the formal, high-ceilinged Reading Room of the Massachusetts Senate yesterday?  I think that there was.  One just had to listen carefully to hear it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Around these parts, though, the answer depends on the type of standard, time and circumstances, and your views on economic theory.', '<p>I''ve received several emails and seen several articles asking whether any eventual decision by Massachusetts to approve two different document standards (e.g., Microsoft''s XML Reference Schema (XMLRS) as well as the OASIS OpenDocument Format) would be a serious blow to the goal of achieving long-term access to documents.  Here are a few examples, each with appended comment threads, if you''re interested: one at at CNET.com''s <a href=''http://news.com.com/2061-11199_3-5999198.html''>Blogma</a> page, and this one by <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2296''>David Berlind</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quick answer is that the "one standard - good, two standards - bad" response is not always the right response, because there are different types of standards that serve different purposes, as well as different situations that have different dynamics.  So my purpose in this post will be partially to give my own take on the "one standard or two?" question in the context of ODF vs. XMLRS, but also to help frame out the debate so that others can form their own conclusions with more context to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here we go.  The first distinction that I want to make is between kinds of standards.  For current purposes, let''s talk about just two of the most common types:  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>1.  Performance standards:</b>  These include things like how many watts or lumens a given bulb is rated for.  The intervals between ratings (e.g., 40, 60, 100 and 150 watts) can be arbitrary, since the goal of the standard is simply to give certainty in the energy demands and output of what you''re buying, and to allow for comparison shopping.  The same goals could be achieved if the ratings had been set at 35, 55 and so on.  And, in fact, if two different sets of standards had for some reason developed, you could still compare bulbs rated at 35 and 40 watts pretty intelligently. </p >\r\n\r\n<p><b>2.  Interoperability standards:</b>  In information and communication technologies, most standards are of a different kind, and exist for the purpose of allowing diverse programs and devices to "plug and play" with each other.  The benefits of these standards are huge, and include the following:  the "network effects" that economists like (the more nodes to the network, the more valuable the network); less risk of finding oneself in a legacy situations; comparison shopping and competitive bidding; and so on.  Using our light bulb example again, without standard bulb stems, you would have to buy your bulbs from the same manufacturer that made the lamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the above examples, you can see that performance standards are useful, but not essential, while interoperability standards are either essential, from an economic sense (e.g., to avoid great time and expense to constantly jury rig systems and convert data), or in an ultimate sense, since they permit something to be done that otherwise could not otherwise be done at all (e.g., making possible the creation of the Internet and the Web).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second distinction I''d like to illustrate has to do with time and circumstances.  The time element is important, for two reasons.  First, where a market has not yet emerged, it''s easier to agree on a standard, because no vendors are heavily invested in any particular solution.  These standards are called "anticipatory standards," and they are often created with less contention.  The opposite situation is where many products already exist, and where the eventual standard adopted can often favor one vendor over another.  </p>There exist, as you might expect, many gradations in between, that arise from preexisting alliances and cross-licenses, ease of migration, and so on.  As a result, things can get bloody even with anticipatory standards, sometimes just because there is so much at stake.  The current HD DVD-BlueRay standards battle is an excellent, and regrettable, example of such a situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the time factor can lead to an interesting and contrary result:  sometimes its actually good to have competing standards.  Let''s use the first generation of wireless interoperability standards as an example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once upon a time, there were groups working not only on creating the Bluetooth standard and the first Wi-Fi standard, but others as well â€“ such as HomeRF.  And today, there are additional standards that are in the same general functional area, such as the Near Field Communication standard.  Many of these standards were originally touted as being head to head competitors to serve the same purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But setting standards can sometimes be like skeet shooting â€“ you have to swing your shotgun, leading the clay bird, and making your best guess where the trajectories of the bird and the shot will intersect in the future, knowing that a sudden gust of wind can mean a clean miss even if your calculations and your aim were otherwise dead on. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difficulty of predicting the future when setting anticipatory standards is clearly demonstrated by the example of early wireless data standards development.  HomeRF disappeared, Bluetooth found a home in one set of short-range applications, and Wi-Fi predominated for longer distances, while Near Field Communications is filling in application gaps left by both.  In each of these cases, there was an overlap of situations where both techniques could be used.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But over time, it became clear which standard was optimally useful within those areas of overlap. If all of these standards hadn''t been launched  in anticipatory mode, then large gaps may have been left in the standards landscape (or those gaps may have been addressable only using a standard that offered sub par performance) by the time that hardware and software developments were complete and products were ready to sell. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note also that while the Bluetooth standard appears to be fairly static, the 802.11 standards development effort within the IEEE that gave the world the extremely successful Wi-Fi standard is going on to provide multiple additional generations of development (e.g., WiMax and WiLan), some of which have spawned internally competing submissions as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let''s take just a moment to look at circumstances, by which I mean the impact of reality on the standard setting process.  For better or worse, standards are thrashed out in the trenches, and idealism often yields to pragmatism.  So it is that the best standard does not always get adopted, just as the best product does not always win over the hearts and minds of the marketplace.  As a result, pursuading the market to implement a particular standard often requires tactics, alliances, and, not atypically, some luck as well.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here''s one last distinction to take into account when deciding whether one standard is always best:  the value of certainty vs. the benefits of competition.  There are some economists who strongly argue that two standard are always better than one -- and that in some situations we would all be better off with no standard at all.  In their view, setting a standard too early in the process stifles innovation, and leads to constraining the technical choices that vendors can make, and therefore the solutions that  are available in the marketplace to buy.  More to the current point, they also argue thate if there are two standards, the proponents of both alternatives have a greater incentive to further optimize their standard, and to update it  to remain current with market demands. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So â€“ what conclusion does that lead me to in the case of ODF and XMLRS?  Let''s go through the same distinctions I laid out above, beginning with "what type of standard do we have here, anyway?" </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, clearly neither ODF nor XMLRS is a performance standard (although in a given situation one of the two formats will have performance advantages over another).  Nor are they really interoperability standards, as we usually think of them, although (I assume) each would facilitate interoperability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What they really are is "accessibility standards," but not in the same sense that accessibility has been bandied about lately as part of the same debate.  More succinctly stated, the unique value that each is intended to provide is to augment the availability of data over time.  So in this sense, they are more like performance standards than interoperability standards, because the value of having one as compared to two is relative rather than absolute.  To use a comparison, it would be better if we only had to have one set of socket wrenches rather than two (e.g., English and Metric), but as long as we have both, we can still do what we need to do, and life goes on.  Stated  another way, we''re not by definition in a network situation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about time and circumstances?  Well, the fact is that there are one whole hell of a lot of Office documents out there, so Microsoft has a justifiable reason to want a good solution for Office users.  Also, there really isn''t any reason why one would expect Microsoft to want to make it easy for its competitors to poach any of its customers.  That''s just reality, so ODF proponents have to deal with this dynamic strategically and tactically.  (Parenthetically speaking, I think that they''re doing a pretty good job of it.)  Of course, as I''ve noted often before, its only fair to observe that the same vendors that are promoting ODF would be no more likely to act philanthropically if their own crown (profit) jewels were at stake than is Microsoft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, what about certainty vs. competition?  Well, the goal from a societal perspective is first and foremost to move to a situation where all documents remain available.  It would be better if we only had to have, in effect, one set of socket wrenches, but better two than none.  Note also that just because we may begin with two sets of tools doesn''t necessarily mean that we will not eventually end up needing only one, either because one format appeals to the marketplace better than the other, or because the two standards ultimately converge (as Alan Yates last week predicted would eventually happen).  But whatever ultimately transpires, the certainly today is that because there are two alternatives in the marketplace, the proponents of both ODF and XMLRS will need to compete with each other.  And that''s a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest winners from this dynamic will be people with disabilities.  To date, Microsoft has mostly responded to accessibility needs when required to do so.  But it has not been driven to excell in the delivery of accessibility in order to maximize either its market share or its profits.  Instead, market conditions have provided incentives only to meet minimum requirements. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with two standards in play, there is motivation for competition between both camps to create more and better accessibility solutions â€“ and that''s a <i>very</i> good thing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where do I come out? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, the older I get the more I tend to adopt a practical rather than a religious attitude towards standards.  I certainly do think that it would have been a heck of a lot better for all concerned if Microsoft had taken advantage of its opportunity to be a charter member of the OASIS ODF Technical Committee and fought it out with Sun and others to create one standard that all Oor at least most) of the members of the TC would eventually support, that the entire OASIS membership would adopt, and that would have provided a good solution for existing Office users as well as a tool for increased competition among a greater variety of office productivity software applications.  But Microsoft chose not to take that step, and (to understate the obvious) there''s nothing that I can do about that now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news, of course, is that ODF is gaining traction, and now the competition is on.  Just because Massachusetts may ultimately approve XMLRS doesn''t mean that it will necessarily use it â€“ that will depend on the products that are available (which will include ODF converters for use with Office documents).  Microsoft will still have to convince those that make purchasing decisions that they are better off with XMLRS than with ODF (and, of course, the opposite will equally be true).  And a rubber stamp by a standards body - if that''s what it proves to be - won''t make any difference in those decisions.  Instead, there will need to be demonstrable value and market confidence that XMLRS will become more, and not less, open as time goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, the ODF and XMLRS specifications will merge some day, with the final standard perhaps being better than either of the progenitors.  If that happens, our document format toolboxes will only need one set of accessibility wrenches.  And if we need two sets for a while, that''s a hell of a lot better than having none at all.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember yesterday?  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Still, they can be tricky to structure and maintain without getting sued - even if the intent is to charge no royalty at all.', '<p>Back on August 9, I <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1472''>wrote about</a> the fact that a patent pool had been <a href=''http://www.symbol.com/category.php?fileName=PR-864_Patent_Licensing.xml''>formed</a> by some of the patent owners that believe that their intellectual property rights (IPR) would be infringed by the implementation of RFID technology.  I was reminded of this entry when a reporter who was writing about the current status of that initiative called me up to explain how patent pools work.  He''s written what I think is a very clear update on this situation, called "The RFID Patent Pool:  Playing Poker," which you can find <a href=''http://rfidtribe.com/news-05-12-19.html''>here</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>The blog entry in question was one of those that I write from time to time that seek to dig below the surface of what is generally perceived to be bad news in order to determine just how bad that news really is.  In this particular case, I was pointing out that if the laudable efforts of those that had been working hard to create a royalty-free environment for RFID technology were going to fail, then the next best outcome could well be a patent pool.  \r\n\r\n<p>Why?  Well, in brief, its because if the going rate for an individual patent license is, say, 5%, and there are 20 different patent holders, then you''re not likely to have any products in the market at all.  But if those same 20 owners agree to cap the total royalty per device at 5%, and also hire an agent to provide a single license to all those 20 patents, then the technology can move forward into the marketplace in a cost effective and orderly fashion.\r\n\r\n<p>It sounds simple, but it''s much more tricky than that.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn''t, which is why you don''t hear about them more often.  Besides the practical problems with herding all of the IPR owner cats into the corral, there''s also the fact that the concept of competitors getting together and setting prices waves all kinds of antitrust flags.  \r\n\r\n<p>As a result, those that form a patent pool frequently describe what they plan to do in a letter to the Department of Justice (one of the two U.S. agencies that enforce the antitrust laws in this country) asking for a "business review" of what they planned to do.  If the DOJ thinks that the benefits of the arrangement to the consumers ("procompetitive effects") outweigh the antitrust concerns, then the DOJ will send back what is often referred to as a "no action" letter.  It''s non-binding on the DOJ, and would also not constrain any court hearing a suit brought by a private party, but receiving this sort of initial green light from those in the know is considered to be sufficient comfort for most companies to move forward.  You can see an example of a letter of this type relating to a DVD patent pool <a href=''http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/busreview/2485.htm''>here</a>, and a more easily digested press release <a href=''http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1999/2484.htm''>here</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>But even with care, patent pools can still be attractive targets for litigation.  The 3C DVD patent pool, which includes Sony Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and Philips Electronics, found itself the defendant in a national class action law suit in <a href=''https://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/sony2''>2004</a>, and of another suit (this time brought by two Chinese DVD manufacturers) in January of this year - even though the members of this pool had obtained a no action letter themselves.  The following article, written from the Chinese perspective, makes for <a href=''http://www.cqtv.com.cn/20050202/68654.shtml''>interesting reading</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>So what does all this, you may ask, have to do with open source software?  Well, there have already been a number of initiatives launched that could eventually lead to one or formal patent pools to support open source software â€“ not for the purpose of charging royalties, of course, but for the purpose of creating "save havens" where open source licensing terms are assured.  One such step is the <a href='' http://www.patentcommons.org/''>Patent Commons</a> Project, and various companies (e.g., IBM and others) have made unilateral pledges not to assert certain patents against open source solutions.\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, it will be possible to structure any such project in a way that makes all of those that participate feel comfortable. But the antitrust laws are tricky â€“ even giving things away can be problematic, if the result is to devalue the products of others.  So the task may be more challenging than would initially meet the eye.\r\n\r\n</p>Still, I''m hoping to read (or, better yet, write) an open source no action letter request soon.  Something to look forward to in the New Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

But, as I''ve often pointed out in my other column at this site, <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/blog/''>Consider Thisâ€¦</a>, there are many other types of standards as well, some of which are not developed (as such) by anyone at all, but rather are described from nature, as in the case of the laws of physics, or are pulled from the realm of pure abstraction, as with mathematics.  Today, I not only want to talk about one of these types of non-developed standards, but about the most famous one of all:  e= mc2.  (Sorry, this blog doesn''t support superscripts.)\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the standards that are developed by engineers to achieve predictable results, mathematical formulae and laws of physics are divined, appropriately, by mathematicians and physicists to help us understand the rules by which universe itself, for whatever reason (no, I won''t go there), has decided to operate.\r\n\r\n<p>It''s only appropriate that in this hundredth anniversary of Einstein''s Miracle Year that scientists at the National Institute of Science and Technology <a href=''http://www.nist.gov/ ''>(NIST)</a> and MIT have conducted the "most precise test ever" to confirm that E does, indeed, equal mc2.    According to a NIST press release issued <a href=''http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/einstein.htm''> yesterday</a>, the December issue of <i>Nature</i> includes a report that NIST and MIT scientists have confirmed that "E differs from mc2 by at most 0.0000004, or four-tenths of 1 part in 1 million. This result is â€œconsistent with equalityâ€ and is 55 times more accurate than the previous best direct test of Einsteinâ€™s formula," according to the paper. \r\n\r\n<p>The press release goes on to disclose that others have conducted more complicated tests that imply closer agreement between E and mc2 than the NIST/MIT work.  However, "additional assumptions" are required to interpret their results, making these previous tests "arguably less direct."\r\n\r\nThe press release goes on to report that the two independent tests conducted by NIST and MIT each used: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nâ€¦optical and X-ray interferometryâ€”the study of interference patterns created by electromagnetic wavesâ€”to precisely determine the spacing of atoms in a silicon crystal, and for using such calibrated crystals to measure and establish more accurate standards for the very short wavelengths characteristic of highly energetic X-ray and gamma ray radiation. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe test was originally conceived thirty years ago by a NIST physicist, Richard Deslattes, who conducted the NIST test but regrettably did not live to see the <i>Nature</i> paper published.\r\n\r\n<p> Interestingly, while most people think of Einstein''s Special Theory of Relativity in the context of the time distortions that the great physicist predicted would be experienced by those traveling vast, interstellar distances at nearly the speed of light, the NIST/MIT experiments were conducted at the inverse end of the distance spectrum: the spaces between subatomic particles.  Here''s the press release again:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe NIST/MIT tests focused on a well-known process: When the nucleus of an atom captures a neutron, energy is released as gamma ray radiation. The mass of the atom, which now has one extra neutron, is predicted to equal the mass of the original atom, plus the mass of a solitary neutron, minus a value called the neutron binding energy. The neutron binding energy is equal to the energy given off as gamma ray radiation, plus a small amount of energy released in the recoil motion of the nucleus.  The gamma rays in this process have wavelengths of less than a picometer, a million times smaller than visible light, and are diffracted or bent by the atoms in the calibrated crystals at a particular energy-dependent angle. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, enough of the technical side of thing, although those that are into crystal lattices may want to buy a copy of <i>Nature</i>, where they can learn (at least in overview) how to catch two ions in a "small electromagnetic trap" (the press release does not say how small a trap must be to be considered "small", but one would assume from its intended captives that the trap would be <i>really</i> small).  If you don''t get around to buying the issue, I should at least tell you that each team of scientists then "counted the revolutions per second made by each ion around the magnetic field lines within the trap," using an impressively gleaming, but prosaicly named, instrument dubbed GAMS4.  I don''t want to give away all of the secrets, but apparently the trick is to use ions of two different elements (in this case, sulfur and silicon).\r\n\r\n<p>Does any of this actually matter to you or to me?  Well, yes.  Because we live in the intermediate distances between the subatomic and the interstellar, and incredibly enough (at least to me), Einstein also predicted that as one flies higher, relativity kicks in, and time slows â€“ and slows enough that if airliner navigational instruments didn''t compensate for the time lag, they''d be miles out of their reckoning by the time they reached (or not, as the case may be) their destinations.\r\n\r\n<p>If you''re in to this sort of scientrivia, you might want to sign up for NIST''s bi-weekly email bulletin, called <a href=''http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/mailform.htm''>TechBeat</a>.

As I recall from a prior story, that''s because the Earth got a bit pokier as a result of last December''s disastrous Tsunami in the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n<p>And therein lies the difference man-made standards and scientific formulae, and between the length of the day and e= mc2.  I mean, the former ain''t <i>bad</i>, but as TechBeat points out, it''s not like you can set your watch by it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

It''s a good thing to keep in mind when you compare ODF and XMLRS', 'Those of us that are, to use an arcane bit of speech, "of a certain age," will remember the initial heyday of underground comics, epitomized by the work of <a href=''http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/Crumb.html''>R. Crumb</a> in come-and-go series such as <i><b>Zap Comix </i></b>and <i><b>Despair</i></b>.

Crumb (who now rather incredibly appears in The New Yorker on an occasional basis), or even about Mr. Natural, but I will use as my  jumping off point a bit of argot that R. Crumb popularized and which you can still find rattling around the Internet.  No, not "Keep on Trucking," but this:\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Natural sez, "Always use the right tool for the job!" \r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, these are words of wisdom to live by.  But how do we know what "the right tool for the job" may be, in a given case?  This question does (finally) lead me to the Topic of the Day, which is this:  ODF or XML Reference Schema (XMLRS):  which is the right tool for <i>your</i> job?\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I''m rather frustrated over this question for two reasons.  First, the specifications themselves are lengthy and complex (more on this later), making any sort of side-by-side comparison a challenging task.  And second, I''m a lawyer, not a software engineer, so I''m definitely <i>not</i> the right tool for this job.  So far, I''m not aware of anyone who has undertaken this task, and I really wish that someone with credibility would do so.\r\n\r\n<p>Until that happens, I''m left with deductive reasoning, but I think that this process may take us surprisingly far down the road, so let''s give it a shot, shall we? But first, we should introduce our combatants.\r\n\r\n<p>In this corner, we have the existing champion (it is, after all, an already adopted standard), the OpenDocument OASIS Format, or ODF, weighing in at a hefty, but trim, 706 pages.  And in that corner, the challenger and candidate Ecma specification: the Microsoft XML Reference Schema, weighing in at over 1900 pages.\r\n\r\n<p>What, if anything, might we deduce from the fact that the challenger is more than 2 Â½ times as long as the current champion?  Let''s come back to that, because really what we should start with is the <i>job</i> that we need a tool for, rather than the tool itself, right?\r\n\r\n<p>So what is the job?  Or, stated another way, what job was each tool created to do?\r\n\r\n<p>We have a lot more to go on here, because both sides have been very clear in what they were trying to achieve.  In the case of ODF, the purpose was to create a standard to which multiple products, both proprietary and open source, could â€“ and as significantly â€“ would be built.  And so it has happened.\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of the challenger, the purpose is explicitly to create a standard that will serve the needs of Microsoft, over and out.  (Should I have said "the needs of Office users?" instead of "the needs of Microsoft?"  No.  Adopting ODF, and solving backward compatibility issues with conversion features outside the format would have been serving the needs of Office users, because it would have given them freedom of choice, given that there are already other office productivity products that support ODF.  It will be years - if ever - before there are similar products supporting XMLRS.)\r\n\r\n<p>So in the one case, the purpose is to create a <i>standard designed to be <b>supported </b> by <b>many products</b></i>, while in the other the goal is to create a <i>standard that is designed to <b>support </b> only a <b>single </b> product. </i>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, we not only have two tools, but those tools were created to do two different jobs.  Or, to be a bit more objective, we have two tools that are targeted at more or less the same job, but which have been highly optimized, in each case, to do a rather different job.  And many would be the decisions, large and small, that you would expect to be made to optimize the tool to best do one job as compared to the other. \r\n\r\n<p>How much does that matter?  That''s a harder answer to nail down with certainty, because now we get into another dimension of what "the job" is.  In the case of ODF, the job is to enable not only long-term access to data, but to enable the creation of the most interoperable, innovative, competitive products and marketplace, while in the case of the XMLRS, it''s to make it easy for Office users to transfer information and not, one would have to assume, to make it particularly easy for anyone else to build products suited to their own unique needs or goals.  Or, perhaps, to build any products at all.</a>\r\n\r\n<p>One has to ask, will there be any incentive for other applications to be developed to accept Office data in any event, where Microsoft will presumably always have the upper hand on where the standard goes next; will always be a step ahead in product development; and will have no incentive to make competition easy?\r\n\r\n<p>I''ll leave that one for you to answer, because now I''d like to finally take a look at the very different length of those two specifications again.  True, Office is today more feature-rich than ODF, so some portion of that extra mass of pages is certainly to be expected.  How much?  Well, certainly not 1200 plus pages over and above the 706 page length of the entire ODF standard.  So no matter how you slice it, there''s a lot of extra detail there.\r\n\r\n<p>So what would that extra detail be about?  We already know what a large part of it is for, and that is to guarantee backwards compatibility â€“ back through multiple generations of Office.  Does that matter?\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is yes, and the reason is because any time you create a standard, you need to find a balance between technical excellence and accommodating legacy needs; between standardizing at a high enough level of detail to avoid becoming overly constraining; and also at a low enough level to prevent a proliferation of proprietary extensions that destroy the original goals of standardizing at all.  If you strike that balance properly, let''s say that the length would be X (or, for purposes of this example, let''s say, oh, maybe 706 pages).\r\n\r\n<p>So here, we might expect, lies the reason for most or all of those extra pages after we''ve described embedded audio and video and such.  One person who is more technically astute than I am and whose judgment I respect phrased it this way:\r\n\r\n<p>"Look, you can write a specification to make anything backwardly compatible.  But at what cost?   All programs grow warts, and if you want to accommodate all those warts, you have to write all kinds of strange code.  You end up with a complex hodgepodge of ancient languages and dialects, none of which are relevant to the way that you''d want to do things today.\r\n\r\n<p>"The result? Anyone from outside Microsoft who wanted to use MSXML would need to learn all this arcane stuff that just wouldn''t  be needed if they were using ODF instead.  It wouldn''t be there because it was necessary to make good documents, or to make a good standard.  It would just be there to handle all those old versions, and to work around all those warts."\r\n\r\n<p>That''s what would have to happen when you make the standard to suit the application, rather than make the applications to suit the standard.  I expect that this is indeed where a lot of those extra 1200 plus pages come from, and I''d hate to have to struggle through them, let alone have to work with them.  Would you, especially if you could use the ODF specification and get a proprietary or open source converter to plug the gap between an application that supported ODF and an Office document?\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, I guess it comes out like this.  You don''t really have to speculate whether Microsoft has evil designs, and you don''t even have to do a technical comparison to see what else might be under the hood (although I <i>still</i> hope someone will do so).  You can simply decide what the job is that you want to do, and then pick the best tool for that job. \r\n\r\n<p>If the job is to stay a Microsoft Office user, in a Microsoft world, with prices and features determined by Microsoft, then I would heartily endorse XMLRS as the right tool for you â€“ because that''s just the job (and the world) it was designed to serve.\r\n\r\n<p>But if you''d like more choices, competitive prices, richer innovation, market-driven features, and variety -- if that''s your job instead -- then boy, do I have a tool for you!\r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

It was Kurkjian, you may recall, who made the inquiries to Massachusetts State officials that sparked the unfounded investigation into Peter Quinn''s travel documentation.  Kurkjian''s <a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/12/28/technol \r\n ogy_adviser_quits_unexpectedly/''>brief article</a> is titled and subtitled, "Technology adviser quits unexpectedly; Says those against change have made him ''lightning rod,''" and includes the following excerpt from Quinn''s email to his employees, in addition to the excerpts earlier included in the McMillan article: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nI view these circumstances as quite troubling because the good work laid out by the IT Commission is slowly being strangled and brought to a halt. And the last thing I can let happen is my presence be the major            \r\n contributing factor marginalizing the good work of ITD and the entire IT  community.       </blockquote>                                               \r\n\r\nKurkjian also reports on the prospects for Quinn''s legacy being perpetuated, as follows: <blockquote>                                                                            \r\n                                                                            \r\n Eric Fehrnstrom, director of communications for Governor Mitt Romney,      \r\n yesterday confirmed that Quinn had submitted his resignation, effective Jan. 12. Fehrnstrom, however, rebutted Quinn''s strong implication that the administration was backing away from the recommendations, issued on Aug. 31 and announced by former Administration and Finance Secretary Eric Kriss, that the executive branch was moving toward open format software.   \r\n                                                                            \r\n                                                                    <p>''''We are moving steadily towards that deadline and we expect no changes in those rules," Fehrnstrom said. Under the Aug. 31 initiative, the state  would require all documents produced by the state''s executive branch to be  stored in a new, universal computer format, called OpenDocument. </blockquote></blockquote>\r\n\r\nSomewhat incredibly (to me, at least), while Kurkjian also recounts that Quinn had been investigated and cleared of travel improprieties following a "report  in November that Quinn had failed to fill out the required state forms," he fails to mention that he was the journalist  that wrote the report that most obviously led Quinn to feel like a "lightning rod."\r\n\r\n<p>An early article on Quinn''s resignation also appeared at <a href=''http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/management/0,39020654,39244400,00.htm''>ZDNet''s<a/> U.K. site, written by Ingrid Marson, who has been following the Massachusetts ODF story for some time.  The additional information to be found in this article (titled "Massachusetts CIO quits amid OpenDocument furor") is as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nEric Kriss, the former Massachusetts Secretary of Administration and       \r\n Finance who was Quinn''s boss during most of the ODF evaluation process, said that Quinn found it difficult to handle the personal attacks that followed the state''s high profile move.                      Quinn was particularly affected by last month''s report in the Boston <i>Globe</i>, which claimed he had taken unauthorized trips to conferences, according to Kriss. These allegations were investigated, and Quinn was later cleared of any wrongdoing. \r\n\r\n<p> The Boston Globe''s report attracted a flood of criticism from the          \r\n technical and legal community. Groklaw described it as a "character        \r\n assassination in an attempt to discredit OpenDocument."  </blockquote>  \r\n\r\n<p>And that''s all there is so far, 24 hours after the news of Peter Quinn''s resignation spread widely via the Blogosphere to thousands upon thousands of on line readers, spreading comment threads everywhere they appeared.\r\n\r\n<p>If additional news warrants, I''ll post again later today.         \r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

And we should have respect for his privacy.', '<center><i>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.</i><br>\r\n - Computer scientist and visionary Alan Kay</center>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last three and a half months I''ve been covering the ongoing debate and, for want of a better phrase, "related events" surrounding the decision by the Information Technology Division of Massachusetts (ITD) to mandate use of the OpenDocument format (ODF) for archiving Executive Agency documents.  The architect and public spokesperson for that policy has been Peter Quinn, the head of the ITD, and the CIO of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n<p>Like everyone else who has been covering this story, whether on one side or the other, I''ve felt free to use Peter''s name and report on his actions as if they were public property.  Which, in a way, is what one''s name and actions become â€“ even legally, as regards the threshold for proving libel -- when one accepts a public position.  And while I have invariably been complimentary, and even protective (in the case of the <i>Globe</i> article questioning his travel records), I''ve never asked Peter''s permission to keep putting his name out there, day after day and week after week, thereby doing my small bit to help keep him pinned down at the center of a controversy.\r\n\r\n<p>Now, as you know, Peter has decided to resign his position, in part to permit the work of the ITD to move on unhindered, and in part to allow his and his family''s life to do the same thing.  I can''t begrudge him the decision, but I''m very sorry to see him go, especially as a result of the reasons that led to that decision.\r\n\r\n<p>I can''t say that I know Peter.  I''ve interviewed him once, heard him speak or testify three times, and exchanged a few brief emails with him over the past several months.  But I have admired him, and I''d like to take a few minutes to say why.\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, I''ve been working with standards organizations for 18 years, and those organizations have created hundreds of ITC standards during that period.  But most of those standards, while important, were not significant in any larger sense.  Most were simply the cleverly created tools that were needed to take the next incremental step in the march of technical progress.  \r\n\r\n<p>ODF, though, is a standard that <i>matters</i>, even though very few people yet appreciate it. Unless ODF (or another mechanism capable of achieving the same end) becomes universally adopted, much of the information of today''s world will not only fade from view as time passes â€“ it may literally disappear for all practical purposes, leaving little or no trace.  Peter not only realized this, but he committed to do something about it.\r\n\r\n<p>Second, I''ve always admired the leaders and visionaries that see things before the rest of us, and have the courage to show the way.  It''s both risky and lonely to be out in front.  The enemies, doubters and flaks always outnumber the friends and those that "get it," and too often it''s those that follow that get the credit rather than those that took the heat.\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, I''ve always admired people who did the right thing simply because it was the right thing to do, regardless of whether it would be easy or hard, popular or controversial, personally beneficial or costly to one''s career.  There are all too few of us that ever rise to that challenge, especially (it seems) in public life.\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, I and others in the blogosphere and the traditional media will need to mention Peter a bit longer, as the consequences of his resignation play out.  I hope that he will understand and not begrudge our actions too much, in hopes that his goals will be more likely to be achieved as a result.  \r\n\r\n<p>But we should keep it short.  It''s the least we can do for someone who expected no personal benefit from doing something that needed to be done for the benefit of all, and who took the fall for doing so â€“ not because what he wanted to do was wrong, but because what was good for all was threatening to a few, and because those few were powerful.\r\n\r\n<p>So as Peter steps back from the spotlight, I''d like to express my gratitude to him, and wish him well.  \r\n\r\n<p>To everyone else, I''d like to suggest that the best thing we can do for Peter is to give him some peace and privacy.  And we should do everything we can to achieve what he set in motion - for our benefit as well as in recognition of his efforts.

After all, many have suggested that it would be a brave CIO that would stick his neck out after seeing what sort of treatment an innovative policy earned Peter.\r\n\r\n<p>I''m happy to say that I have found a quote from one such state CIO, in a <a href='' http://www.washingtontechnology.com/news/1_1/daily_news/27656-1.html ''>brief article</a> by Ethan Butterfield in Washington Technology.  And not just any state CIO, but from Matt Miszewski, who is also the president of the National Association of State CIOs.\r\n\r\n<p>Here''s what he had to say: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nPeter has left an indelible mark on public sector IT.  His resignation sets in stone the need for change in the area of open source, open standards and, of course, open formats. If the enemies of true change think it sets those efforts back, simply wait.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThanks, Matt.  That''s what a lot of people have been wanting and waiting to hear.  When one soldier in the front lines goes down, another one needs to step in to take his place, or the centre cannot hold.\r\n\r\n<p>It''s good to know that there are others willing to do just that.  If a revelation is in fact at hand, I want it to be one of hope, and not one that slouches back towards the status quo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Although I have lived in England in the past and even read the <i>Guardian</i> on many occasions, I was totally unaware that I had not only read, but written, some of what I enjoyed until an alert reader brought a certain blog post to my attention.  That entry was posted by Jon Levell in his thought provoking blog, <a href=''http://www.coralbark.net/blog/''>Irregular Verbiage</a>, aptly subtitled (the most recent entry is dated November 24th), "Sporadic Musings."\r\n\r\n<p>It seems that in that most recent Musing, Jon was disposed to muse over Open Document.  But his musing did not stop there.  Instead, he culminated with this final, coy muse: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other news, if you are obsessively reading info on the debate about open standards (and specifically whether public organisations like the government of Massachusetts or the European Commission should mandate that their employees use then) then a key source of info is the Standards Blog. What I find most intriguing is that you never see the Standards Blog''s Andy Updegrove and the Guardian''s/Radio 4''s Simon Hoggart in a room together.<p>\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.coralbark.net/blogphotos/newsquiz_hoggart.jpg">\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmm.  He had a point.  To the best of my knowledge, I <i>had</i> never been seen in the same room as Guardian/Radio 4''s Simon Hoggart; at least, to be objective, unless I <i>was</i> Simon Hoggart.\r\n\r\n<p>While some (Alan Yates springs to mind) might question my objectivity, in fact I have tried to be scrupulously objective in my reporting of facts and in any analysis of legal language that I offer on line, while preserving the right to express the opinions that I form as a result of what I observe.  I strive to maintain a reputation for objectivity not only for its own sake, but in order that my opinions will be given credibility and weight, as well as the facts I report.\r\n\r\n<p>Thus it is that I feel that I cannot shy away from the challenge that Mr. Levell has obliquely presented.  \r\n<p>I therefore take it as obligatory that I investigate Mr. Levell''s disturbing suggestion that I am "Guardian/Radio 4''s Simon Hoggart", rather than mild-mannered Massachusetts attorney and standards wonk Andy Updegrove.  After all, perhaps the greatest test of objectivity arises when evaluating oneself.  Moreover, I shall do so with as much diligence as I would a contention that Mr. Yates (for example) is in fact Presidential Press Secretary Scott McClellan (perhaps I''ll return to that intriguing possibility in a future blog entry).\r\n\r\n<p>With that as prelude, here are the significant facts that I uncovered, as well as my ultimate conclusion after balancing all ambiguities against my own sense of identity:\r\n\r\n<p>1.  Mr. Hoggart was born on May 26, 1946.  I was born on November 9, 1953.  Close enough for government work.\r\n\r\n<p>2.  Mr. Hoggart has an <a href=''http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4051777.stm''>entry</a>  in the Wikipedia, and I do not.  Pure coincidence, or careful research on the part of the Wikipedia staff, notwithstanding the recent controversy over the accuracy of the on-line encyclopedia?\r\n\r\n<p>3.  According to that same entry, Mr. Hoggart is alleged to have had a brief affair with <a href=''http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4051777.stm''>Kimberly Quinn</a>. I do not recall everâ€¦ahem, being in the same room as Ms. Quinn, but, on the other hand, I have no recollection of ever being in the same room as Mr. Hoggart, so these two pieces of data appear to cancel each other out.\r\n\r\n<p>4.  Mr. Hoggart chairs BBC 4''s weekly show, <a href='' http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/newsquiz.shtml''>The News Quiz</a>, a delightfully erudite, humorous and occasionally pedantic show which I have often enjoyed.  I have some small pretensions to being both erudite and humorous, while my partners regularly assure me that I am pedantic in the extreme.\r\n\r\n<p>5.  Mr. Hoggart is the author of, among other works, a compendium of absurd Christmas Letters, titled <a href='' http://www.westminsterbookshop.co.uk/images/475/1843544741.jpg''>The Hamster that Loved Puccini</a>.  I am forced to admit that I am fully capable of giving (and perhaps have given) such a name to a book, should I ever write/have already written one.\r\n\r\n<p>6.  I have not been able to contact Mr. Hoggart by telephone to put the question to him/me, but each time I placed the call, <i>his phone was invariably busy!</i>\r\n\r\n<p>But enough of this.\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, I have been unable to disprove the suggestion of Mr. Levell that Guardian''s/Radio 4''s Simon Hoggart and I are one and the same.  Therefore, resolving all doubts against my own bias that I am, at least in this regard, unique, and assuming that Mr. Levell is a responsible practitioner of the blogging trade and has some evidence to support his implied allegation, I must, with regret, surrender my identity.\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, a note to Mr. Levell.\r\n\r\n<p>I see from the CV that you have posted at your site that you have earned a  Ph.D in Theoretical Particle Physics.  Having myself (or, as the case may be, Mr. Hoggart''s self) at best only a muddled and imperfect knowledge of <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics''>quantum mechanics</a>, perhaps you can explain, for Simon''s and my benefit and in the manner of the late lamented Douglas Adams, the seeming duality of existence that I/he/we/whoever seem to be experiencing.  After all, if I''m not really here, how do I know that Mr. Hoggarts is really there?  For that matter, what is the probability density of <i> <b>either</b>, let alone both, of us really being in that room at all?</i>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, as was once more succinctly phrased by the <a href='' http://www.firesigntheatre.com/funway.html''> Firesign Theatre</a>, in their 1969 appreciation album, <a href='' http://www.whyaduck.com/cards/all-hail.jpg''>All Hail Marx [and] Lennon</a>, "How can you be in two places at once, when you''re not anywhere at all?"   \r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Levell, Simon''s and/or my identity are at your mercy.  We await your response.\r\n\r\n<p>Please muse on that.\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

And he will be the official to whom Peter Quinn''s successor will report between now and the effective date of the open format policy.\r\n\r\n<p>Secretary Trimarco also confirmed to Ms. Hamel that Peter Quinn left his post voluntarily, at least in the official sense (I say "formal" because Peter''s farewell email indicates that the distinction between actual termination and his ability to properly do his job in the face of other types of action may have been a slim one). \r\n\r\n<p>With this statement from Secretary Trimarco, the path forward towards implementation of ODF will hopefully be swift, especially if the Secretary''s statement to Linda Hamel as quoted here is not only widely reported, but also repeated to journalists in the formal press in response to their own independent inquiries for confirmation.\r\n\r\n <p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Mitt Romney''s office. \r\n\r\n<p>Pepoli, who formerly served as the chief operating officer of the IT Division, will temporarily replace Peter Quinn, who stepped down at the end of last month, citing political pressure. A search for a permanent replacement is ongoing, Fehrnstrom said. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe story goes on to report the most concrete statement thus far by the administration to the effect that it''s full speed ahead towards a January 2007 implementation of Peter Quinn''s legacy policy: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nFehrnstrom said the state remains on schedule for an implementation of OpenDocument-based desktop software in executive branch agencies. "There have been no changes in the commonwealth''s published OpenDocument rules, and we are still on track for a January 2007 implementation," Fehrnstrom said. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nGiven that it is less than a year now until the effective date of the policy and the fact that there has been no announcement of approving Microsoft''s XML Reference Schema before it is approved by Ecma, that would appear to conclusively confirm that implementation of the policy, using ODF, is proceeding full speed ahead.\r\n\r\n<p>Martin had also independently confirmed that Massachusetts is  <a href=''http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6018311.html''>standing by ODF</a> earlier in the week, based on an earlier interview.  To quote Martin from that story: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nA spokesperson for Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney''s office on Wednesday said there are no changes to the state''s plan to adopt standards-based products for storing documents starting in January 2007. \r\n<p>The current technical blueprint, published in September, calls for the state to use OpenDocument-based productivity suites. OpenDocument is a standard created at OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) and not supported by Microsoft Office. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A more lengthy article reviewing the roller coaster of statements and affairs in Massachusetts was posted by Jack Loftus of CIO Decisions.com on Wednesday, and appears <a href=''http://searchopensource.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1155956,00.html''>here</a>.  David Berlind also gave <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2323''>his take</a> on how the latest Massachusetts statement factors into the ongoing drama.\r\n\r\n<p>One interesting email that I''ve received in light of the latest Microsoft security breach (here''s <a href=''http://news.ft.com/cms/s/0d644d5e-7bb3-11da-ab8e-0000779e2340.html''>one of the many articles</a> on that topic from FT.com) asks whether any other product that supports the eventual XML Reference Schema will be at risk of painting a hacking target on their back, given how tightly Microsoft''s Ecma submissions is locked on Office?  In other words, if a hacker finds a back door that''s required by the Ecma standard, would you have stepped into the same mess simply by complying, as required, with to the specification?\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, that could theoretically happen with any specification, but the more granular the spec, the higher the likelihood.  But the XML Reference Schema, as I understand it, is more detailed than ODF, in order to ensure backward compatibility and to otherwise serve the needs of existing Office users.  And, of course, XMLRS  is based upon a product of the most popular hacker target around.\r\n<p>For those that missed the earlier <a href=''http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1319009.cms''>announcement</a> by IBM that it''s its Workplace Managed Client will support Open Document Format (ODF), and its <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1794''>timely impact</a> on the back and forth between ODF and Microsoft''s XML Reference Schema, there''s an article on those plans <a href=''http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=175801681''>here</a>\r\n\r\n<p><i>[Update added 5:00 pm EST:  Sam Hiser has posted an entry at his blog on the <a href=''http://fussnotes.typepad.com/plexnex/2006/01/wmf_the_ecma_sp.html''>establishing a connection</a> between the WMF story and Microsoft''s Ecma submission that reads in part as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nNow, what I find shocking, penetrating & newsworthy is that there is a reference to an implementation of the WMF in the "Ecma spec" for Office "Open" XML. The reference falls in Section 14.3 of the 1900-page Ecma format specification where it discusses how a single WMF is stored in a file along with their Presentation ML code specification. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nEnd update]</i>\r\n<p>And now for that bonkers article.  This is the second negative take by eWeek''s David Coursey on Peter Quinn''s efforts to convert the Executive Agencies to ODF.  Coursey''s first article was titled <a href=''http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1906903,00.asp''>The Open-Source Martyr Meets His Fate </a>, and the following gives a sense of its tenor:<blockquote>\r\nWell, we don''t have Peter Quinn to kick around anymoreâ€¦.Before you shed too many tears for the man, consider that he''s likely to fall up, landing a better job, for more money, than what the people of Massachusetts were paying him.  Such is the fate of this open-source martyr, a man whose name has become known industry-wide, even if most people think he was foolish. </blockquote>\r\n<p>Pamela Jones <a href=''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051230204255532''>excoriated</a> Coursey for that article.  Now, Coursey has <A HREF=''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060106030949216''>returned to the same topic</a>, reporting that he received some rather spirited email as a result of his first article, but then going on to make a number of statements that make it clear that he is not familiar with the use to which Massachusetts actually intends to put ODF â€“ which is exclusively for internal purposes, as I reported in extensive article back in <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/sep05.php#feature''>September</a> in the Consortium Standards Bulletin, which used the detailed FAQ which was even then available at the ITD''s public Website and describes this use in great detail, in order to dispel the misinformation then in the market on this very point.\r\n<p> Pamela Jones has done a great job of contrasting Coursey''s statements on a point by point basis with sections of the FAQ, which you can see in her most recent story, aptly titled <a href=''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060106030949216''>Educating David Coursey</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>And, as Porky Pig used to say in closing his own sage thoughts on the events of the day, <a href=''http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/Shores/7484/ftr/pigstamp.htm''>"That''s all Folks!"</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Is it about to reemerge?', 'A major international standards dispute that most have forgotten may be beginning to rumble again.  That issue is the effort by China to promote its own wireless standard in preference to the globally IEEE 802.11 family of Wi-Fi wireless standards that is in use in most parts of the world, and that is vigorously promoted by Western chip makers such as Intel and Texas Instruments.\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese specification at issue is a wireless local area network (WLAN) security standard called BWIPS (broadband wireless Internet protocol standard), and the rationale given by the Chinese government for developing this alternative was that the Wi-Fi standard provided inadequate security â€“ a contention that had some validity several years ago, when the Chinese standard was created.\r\n\r\n<p>But the Chinese government had announced in 2003 not only that use of its own standard would become compulsory at the end of that year, but also that only a limited number of licenses would be granted to build products implementing that standard.  Foreign vendors would be free to contract with the domestic suppliers that had been granted these licenses.  But unlike the Chinese companies, Western companies would be charged far more for the right to sell products supporting the standard than would the Chinese vendors (the differential arose from the fact that domestic companies would receive a rebate of most of the license fees on the units manufactured).\r\n\r\n<p>The result was a trade dispute that escalated to the highest levels of government, and ultimately resulted in a postponement â€“ but not a revocation - of the effective date of the Chinese standard deadline.  The intention was to permit a cooling off period during which the Chinese could participate in IEEE activities, as well as argue the case for their own standard before ISO, in hopes that a universally accepted global standard would eventually emerge.  \r\n\r\n<p>One of the principal levers used by the United States in the dispute is the Act on Technical Barriers to Trade (TTA), under the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits the use of standards purely for the purpose of favoring domestic goods over those imported from other countries.  The full story can be read in much greater detail in the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/apr05.php''>April 2005 issue</a> of the <b><i>Consortium Standards Bulletin</i></b>, which was dedicated to the emerging standards might of China in general, and to this dispute in particular.\r\n\r\n<p>Now the issue is emerging again, as reported over the weekend in <a href=''http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-01/07/content_510193.htm''>China Daily</a>, which state in part as follows, in an article titled "Network products receive lift": <blockquote>\r\n<p>Products that comply with the Chinese security standard for wireless networks will get a boost from the central government in the form of a recommendation for procurement. \r\n<p>According to a circular published on the website of the National Development and Reform Commission on Thursday, organizations using the State budgets to procure computers, telecommunication equipment, printers, copies and projectors should give preference to the recommended products from next month. \r\n<p>The joint circular by the commission, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Information Industry said those organizations, which have special requirements on information security, must buy recommended products. \r\n<p>The circular says the main purposes are to protect national information security, safeguard the interests of the nation and society, and promote the national economy and the use of information technology. </blockquote>\r\nThe article goes on to relate the past history of the standards dispute from the Chinese perspective, noting in part as follows: <blockquote>\r\n<p>The standard claims to ensure higher security on information transmission in a WLAN network, which became a hot issue because of aggressive pushes from international giants, especially Intel. One of the biggest features of Intel''s Centrino notebook processors is its WLAN capability. \r\n<p>However, the WLAN network is also known for its lower security control, which can lead to information leakage, so some Chinese researchers decided to start to develop a solution. The result is BWIPS, which became the national compulsory standard in 2003. \r\n<p>The Chinese standard required all players in the WLAN industry to make their products comply with the BWIPS standard and co-operate with some Chinese partners. \r\n<p>That aroused complaints from companies such as Intel and WLAN chipmaker Broadcom, which finally became a focal point of a trade dispute between China and the United States. \r\n<p>In 2004, the two countries reached an agreement, and China promised to postpone the implementation of the standard indefinitely. </blockquote>\r\n<p>While the story does not indicate that the postponement is being lifted, it does appear to signal that the Chinese government is testing the limits of how much preference it can still give to its home grown standard while not violating the prohibitions of the TTA, and invoking a protest within the WTO.  The article is sensitive to this possibility, and includes the following: <blockquote>\r\nA member of the BWIPS working group, who declined to be named, said yesterday that the circular is just a confirmation of the Chinese Government''s emphasis on information security and encouragement on technological innovation. \r\n<p>"It is a question of national security, so the top officials in the government are also very attentive to that, meaning that State agencies should act first," he said in a telephone interview. \r\n<p>Intel, a strong opponent of that standard, declined to comment, saying it should evaluate the policy first. \r\n<p>Li Ke, a senior semiconductor analyst with the domestic research house CCID Consulting, said that the circular shows the government''s concern about information security and its intention to encourage the use of the domestic technology. \r\n<p>"Although the implementation of BWIPS was postponed, it is still an effective national standard, so it is not surprising that products based on the standard become recommended products" he said. \r\n<p>He added that since the circular addresses only government procurement and every country has the right to give preferences to domestic products and services, that move does not violate the principles of the World Trade Organization.</blockquote>\r\n<p>It remains to be seen, on the one hand, whether China will expand the policy further, and on the other hand, how Intel, Texas Instruments, and the Department of Commerce will react to the announcement, particularly since improvements in security have been made in the Wi-Fi standard since the dispute originally heated up.  If the Chinese circular is just the beginning of a new effort to push the Chinese standard in the home market or that parity has been reached on security, it may be that these companies will once again contend that China is pushing the envelope of its obligations under the TTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Prior art, under patent law, is technology that is already public.  Since new patents must describe inventions that are "novel" (i.e., new), the existence of prior art that either represents the same invention, or would make the new invention "obvious" (a disqualifier under patent law) will prevent a patent from issuing â€“ but only if the patent examiner that is reviewing the patent application becomes aware of it.\r\n\r\n<p>This is where the new initiatives come in, which are most completely described in an <a href=''http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20060110005422&newsLang=en''>IBM press release</a>.  The initiative most germane to the open source community is called "Open Source Software as Prior Art," and is described in the press release as follows: <blockquote> \r\n\r\n[A] a project that will\r\n        establish open source software - with its millions of lines of\r\n        publicly available computer source code contributed by\r\n        thousands of programmers - as potential prior art against\r\n        patent applications. OSDL [Open Source Development Labs], IBM, Novell, Red Hat and VA Software''s SourceForge.net will develop a system that stores\r\n        source code in an electronically searchable format, satisfying\r\n        legal requirements to qualify as prior art. As a result, both\r\n        patent examiners and the public will be able to use open\r\n        source software to help ensure that patents are issued only\r\n        for actual software inventions. Information for this project\r\n        is available on the <a href=''        http://developer.osdl.org/dev/priorart/''>OSDL web site</a></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe second leg of what is essentially an early warning system for patent examiners (and their private-sector watchdogs) is called the "Open Patent Review" initiative, and is described in the IBM press release as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n    [A] program that seeks to establish an\r\n        open, collaborative community review within the patenting\r\n        process to improve the quality of patent examination. This\r\n        program will allow anyone who visits the USPTO web site to\r\n        submit search criteria and subscribe to receive regularly\r\n        scheduled emails with links to newly published patent\r\n        applications in requested areas. Established in conjunction\r\n        with the USPTO, this program will encourage communities to\r\n        review pending patent applications and to provide feedback to\r\n        the patent office on existing prior art that may not have been\r\n        discovered by the applicant or examiner. Professor Beth Noveck\r\n        of New York Law School will lead a series of workshops on the\r\n        subject. For more information, visit Professor Noveck''s\r\n        project <a href=''http://dotank.nyls.edu/communitypatent''>website</a>. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe third initiative is more subjective, and addresses patents that, for better or worse, have already been issued.  This project is called the "Patent Quality Index:" <blockquote>\r\n\r\n   --  Patent Quality Index - an initiative that will create a\r\n        unified, numeric index to assess the quality of patents and\r\n        patent applications. The effort will be directed by Professor\r\n        R. Polk Wagner of the University of Pennsylvania with support\r\n        from IBM and others and will be an open, public resource for\r\n        the patent system. The index will be constructed with\r\n        extensive community input, backed by statistical research and\r\n        will become a dynamic, evolving tool with broad applicability\r\n        for inventors, participants in the marketplace and the USPTO.\r\n        Information about the Patent Quality Index is available at:\r\n        http://www.patentqualityindex.org. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Markoff article, the project planning was finalized at a meeting held last month between the PTO, IBM, Novell, Redhat, and academic participants.  Future participation will be open to all, with a first public meeting scheduled for February 16 at the PTO.\r\n\r\n<p>How successful will these initiatives be?  At first blush, it would appear that these new projects may best be thought of as source of more efficient tools that overworked patent examiners can use to increase the quality of their work, while at the same time permitting interested outsiders to direct the attention of those same examiners where it needs to be focused.  Given that patent examiners are under pressure to complete discrete tasks in set time periods, and the vast and difficult to search store of software that is already in existence, these new tools should be of high value.\r\n\r\n<p>The next question (besides how quickly and well these new resources can be created) will be how and whether the private sector organizes itself around these initiatives, coordinates its actions, and communicates with the PTO.  \r\n\r\n<p>And, of course, how well the PTO listens. \r\n         \r\n<p><i> <center)<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Not only will this give news agencies and software developers a unified method for handling news, but it will also provide an XML framework for a future family of IPTC news exchange standards covering such diverse specialties as sports, entertainment and financial news. \r\n\r\nUnder the IPTC model, text, photo, graphics, video -- in fact, any combination of media types -- can be bundled into packages that neatly wrap the news content, information about the content and a management layer. Senders can make the XML wrapper as simple or complex as desired, tailoring the final package to the exact needs of their customers. \r\n\r\nAs with all IPTC standards, when work is completed NewsML 2 standards will be released for use without payment or royalties.

I still haven''t seen anything in the Western press on this story, but last night another Chinese source reported a second development: the Chinese government will now allow any company - domestic or foreign - to license the WAPI encryption standard.  The story appears at <a href=''http://www.chinatechnews.com/index.php?action=show&type=news&id=3414''>ChinaTechNews.com</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>The significance of this development is that previously, only 24 domestic Chinese companies had been licensed to implement the standard, meaning that anyone who wished to sell products (e.g., wireless-enabled laptops) in China that implemented the standard would need to contract with one of those companies in order to do so.\r\n\r\n<p>This latest story does not state, however, whether the economic playing field will also be leveled.  Originally, domestic companies were to receive a substantial rebate with respect to their products, while foreign companies would not.\r\n\r\n<p>Opening up the WAPI standard to all is not a surprise, in that China has been seeking to have the standard approved globally by ISO - something that could not happen unless it was available to all.  By doing so at this time, China presumably is indicating that it is turning up the heat on ISO to accept WAPI on an equal basis with Wi-Fi - the IEEE standard that has been elsewhere widely adopted, and which has been strongly supported by Intel and other Western chip vendors.\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting question thus arises: if China will require (as this story also states) that WAPI encryption will become mandatory for products in addition to those purchased by government agencies, then Western companies may actually wish to support WAPI at ISO.  Why?  Because in order to gain ISO adoption, China would presumably need to drop any economic advantages for domestic companies.  Given the size of the Chinese market, having two standards - Wi-Fi and WAPI - may seem like the lesser of two evils to the companies that want equal access to the profits to be made in the PRC.  \r\n\r\n<p>Given that the formal press hasn''t picked up on this story yet, I''ll continue to pass along what I can find in English-translation Chinese news services.\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Now the water is drawn off to send to distant cities and to water broad fields of alfalfa and cotton, leaving only dry washes as evidence of what used to be.', '<i>[I am hiking in Arizona this week and will be writing about that instead of technology until I return.]</i>\r\n\r\n<p>I began driving my rented four-wheel drive car about a half hour before dawn today with the objective of reaching a small area of public land that I had selected using a topographic map.  What made this particular area of interest was the fact that it lay between a certain river (dry now, but flowing before modern farmers commandeered it to water their fields)and adjacent highlands.  Equally important was the likelihood that existing jeep tracks would allow me to get reasonably close to my desired destination (I don''t believe in creating new ones, especially in arid regions, where the damage takes many years to heal).\r\n\r\n<p>As the sun was nudging over the horizon, I was turning off the paved road and onto a jeep track that was headed, more or less, in the right direction.  Shooting the straights to gather enough momentum to carry through the occasional stretches of deep sand and braking sharply into the turns and gullies that crossed the track to keep the vehicle both moving and in one piece, I navigated by sight for the next half hour, switching tracks and gradually working my way closer to where I wished to go.\r\n\r\n<p>Navigating by sight is easy in most of Arizona, of course, where forests are limited to the higher elevations.  But the landscape where I was headed this particular day was more reminiscent of some of the dry areas of the Hawaiian Islands than the Arizona of tourist brochures.  Instead of cactus and sandy soils, I was driving across the shattered, black rock of a not so ancient lava flow, lightly dusted here and there with tufts of dry, yellow grass, and little more.  But unlike the Hawaiian Islands, where vast cinder cones rise thousands of feet into the air and gently slope for miles in every direction, all here was random and jagged.\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, I took a turn towards the edge of the plateau upon which I was driving, and the jeep track zigzagged it''s way sharply down a ravine eroded into the escarpment, taking me, finally, to a dry, gentle incline that ended at the flat valley below.  \r\n\r\n<p>From the bottom of the valley, the edge of the lava flow looked like any mesa, except that the color of its face was a harsh, erodede surface of black.  A mile or more across the dry riverbed, chocked with mesquite and underbrush, a much taller, but equally dark ridge of volcanic rock extended to the East for ten miles or more.  Later, I found my way back along its base, and could see that the surface of the 700 foot tall ridge was an endless expanse of shattered black rock, with nothing growing upon it but a blush of dried grass, and at great intervals, an enormous, solitary saguaro cactus, perched hundreds of feet up on the impossibly steep, 75 degree slope and surreally raising its arms like a supplicant to the unheeding sky.\r\n\r\n<p>Once on the valley floor, I continued for another half mile through the dry mesquite, aiming towards a promontory of the same black mesa, and eventually came to a stop next to what I had hoped to find: a roughly triangular, flat-topped hillock, only a few feet high, and perhaps 25 by 40 feet in dimensions.  Looking down at its side, I saw that it was liberally covered with bits of broken rock â€“ dark black, white, red and yellow, as well as shards of pottery.  The top of the hillock was similarly littered with material that had been pushed to the surface over hundreds of years by kangaroo rats and other desert rodents as they dug their burrows into the sand.\r\n\r\n<p>What I was looking at was a ruin of a Native American dwelling compound, comprising four or five rooms, that had been abandoned perhaps 800 years ago, now completely filled and covered with wind-blown soil and sand, and serving as a kind of raised garden for scattered mesquite bushes.\r\n\r\n<p>I did not expect to find any arrowheads, knives or other tools here (and couldn''t have kept them if I did), although several days before I had indeed found a number of broken arrowheads at an older site at a higher elevation.  Unlike that older hunter-gatherer site, the habitation I was now looking down upon was permanent, and dated to the agricultural period.  Most of the meat consumed by those that had lived here would have come from domesticated turkeys and small animals (mainly rabbits) caught with snares, rather than from larger game brought down by arrows or spears.\r\n\r\n<p>Had I been 100 miles upriver, the pottery that was scattered on the ground would have been more colorful, with striking geometric patterns.  Farther to the East and North, the color schemes would have been balck Anasazi designs on a white or red background.  Across the border in Southwest New Mexico, the pottery left by the Mimbres people would show fantastic images of real and mythical animals.  But here where I stood, the pottery was a simple, grey ware, tending towards black on the bottom, and a flat brick color on the inside.  When the sun caught the inside of some shards, tiny pieces of mica used as "temper" to avoid breakage when the pot was fired glinted brightly.\r\n\r\n<p>Only a few pieces were more colorful â€“ a richer red with a softer tone, achieved by polishing the pot with a stone towards the end of its preparation.  And every now and again, I''d find a piece of a cockle shell â€“ a fine section of the shell laboriously sawn free, and used as a bracelet â€“ trade goods from many hundreds of miles away.\r\n\r\n<p>The flakes and large pieces of broken stone that were liberally scattered about were of various types: white and yellow "sugar" quartz struck from the cobbles that lay about; a deep rich black stone from; white chalcedony; and a very few pieces of obsidian â€“ trade goods again, perhaps from Nevada or Mexico.  A few pieces of broken basalt manos and metates â€“ the former a hand-held grind stone, and the latter the surface upon which seeds and grain were ground â€“ completed the lithic inventory.\r\n\r\n<p>All around, for as much as a quarter mile in any direction, similar material lay scattered about.  Some pieces of pottery were larger than your hand.  At one time, many people would have lived here, in settlements all along the wide, now-missing  river for over a hundred miles.  Crops would have been grown in fields watered by irrigation ditches, and small compounds of adobe-walled, single story houses would have dotted the landscape, looking out on the wide river that had cut this wide valley down through the black lava flow that stood proud in the near and far distance.\r\n\r\n<p>I nosed around for awhile, seeing if any of the adjacent pieces of pottery might fit (they almost never do), and determining the size of the settlement area and the elevation at which it began and ended.  I also took a few pictures, and as always, tryed to imagine what it all would have looked like long ago, with children playing, women grinding corn outside their dwellings, and smoke rising from cooking fires.  All of this would have overlooked carefully tended green fields stretching along the sides of the river, which itself would have been rimmed with reeds sheltering duck and heron.  But now, like virtually every other river in Arizona, there was nothing but dust and a thick jungle of twisted underbrush in the valley botom, with pretty pieces of stone and plain grey pottery lying in the dust where those that had tended those fields once had lived.\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, I climbed back into the car and left the silent mounds of mesquite-overgrown sand, and the parched and dusty valley whose river had been had piped and ditched and apportioned for the use of farmers far away, so that cotton could be grown for factories and alfalfa for feedlots instead of maize. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p><i>To read more <b>Wilderness Journal</b> entries, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=28''>here</a>.\r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

It is 142 miles by two-lane road from Tucson and about the same distance from Phoenix, and is surrounded on all sides by areas that do not draw a crowd: the Tohono O''odham Indian reservation to the East, and the vast Barry Goldwater Air Force testing range to the North and West.  To the South is the Sonora State of Mexico.  And once you get there, it has nothing to offer besides a unique species of cactus, a few hiking trails, and average Arizona scenery (much of it gorgeous), making it one of the least frequented parts of the American Southwest.\r\n\r\n<p>When I arrived for a few days of hiking and camping to start my trip, I found that it was both more and less used than before, as well as even less easy to get around in than in the past.\r\n\r\n<p>The 517 square miles of Organ Pipe were set aside in 1937 and have provided a largely wilderness environment ever since.  But recently, the preserve was considered for "decommissioning" due to what has been called a "state of siege" by those crossing illegally from Mexico â€“ would-be immigrants, on foot, and drug smugglers, increasingly using various forms of motorized vehicles.  In writing this entry, I stumbled upon a Webpage with a collection of articles on the situation, which can be found <a href=''http://www.desertinvasion.us/articles/articles_opnm.html''>here</a>\r\n\r\n<p>In consequence, while the mountain scenery of the park remains breathtaking, the Park Service has made many changes: most of the roads that allowed vehicle access to parts of the Monument are now closed, and a six-foot high, vehicle-proof  wall of railroad ties supported by steel posts sunk in concrete is being built along the entire thirty mile side that forms a part of the US-Mexico border â€“ not so much to keep the illegals that cross on foot out of the park, but to stop the more dangerous (to both legal visitors as well as the plant life of the park) vehicular traffic of the drug runners.  According to <a href='' http://www.azstarnet.com/dailystar/relatedarticles/5746.php''>one article</a> I read, In 2002, park rangers made 100 felony arrests and seized 14,000 pounds of marijuana.  \r\n\r\n<p>Articles on the page noted above include information like this: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nFor a tract of desert wilderness that is supposed to be left alone by humans, this national park is a mess. Fragile ocotillo shrubs and saguaro cactuses lay lifeless where they were mowed down. Foot trails and car tracks scar the delicate sandy ground in all directions. Trash is everywhere.<i>[Chicago Tribune, 	August 19, 2003]</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd this: <blockquote>\r\nAt Organ Pipe... ''This park comes alive after dark,'' explains Bo Jones, a 35-year-old ranger, as he bounces down a rutted desert road in a truck containing the tools of his trade -- including body armor and a semiautomatic rifleâ€¦.On any given night, Mr. Jones estimates, as many as a thousand illegal aliens are moving north... At the same time... there may be a ton of marijuana being lugged north in 50-pound loads by husky backpackers. They sleep by day and move at night, guided by lookouts posted on mountains with solar-powered phones to warn them of approaching agents. <i>[ Wall Street Journal, January 22, 2003]</i></blockquote>\r\nThe effect is somewhat surreal.  The desert may be crawling with human life on moonless nights, but during the day, you''d never know, but for the various pieces of clothing and water bottles that do, in fact come into view from time to time.  Still, 517 square miles can absorb a lot of water bottles without too much visual damage, and to some extent the current nocturnal traffic is as much a part of the history and ecology of the area as are the organ pipe cacti themselves.  As observed by the ranger from whom I obtained my camping permit, "This has been a trade route for thousands of years."\r\n<p>The most sad and striking evidence of the situation, though, is an unobtrusive bronze ranger hat on a small boulder outside the Visitors Center.  On the boulder there is a plaque, which reads as follows: <blockquote>\r\n<center>On August 9, 2002 <br>\r\nWhile protecting visitors from harm</br>\r\nUnited States Park Ranger Kriss Eggle </br>\r\nWas slain in the line of duty </br>\r\nHis service and sacrifice  </br>\r\nTo the National Park Service </br>\r\nAnd the people of this Country </br>\r\nWill Never be forgotten.</blockquote></center>\r\nEggle was 28, and was killed  by an AK-47 bullet while assisting Border Patrol agents apprehend two men suspected by Mexican officials of being involved in a drug-related quadruple murder.\r\n<p>I had hoped to camp wherever I chose, and asked at the Visitors Center whether that was still possible, perhaps at Growler Canyon, which looked interesting to me on a topographical map, and could be reached from Ajo via a twenty mile gravel road.  Yes, the ranger told me at the Visitors Center, I could camp there, if I chose, but it was a high nocturnal traffic area, and there was a Border Patrol encampment there as a result.  I''d have to let the agents know that I would be in the area.  But, she said, after that "You can just ignore them â€¦"[pause, then an afterthought], "that is, unless they''re coming down the middle of the road at 90 miles an hour."  \r\n<p>I grudgingly took one of the four primitive campsites available in Alamo Canyon as a compromise, having promised back home that I would be prudent.  And in truth, it wasn''t bad, situated at the end of a three-mile jeep track, tucked up against high mountains that glowed red and orange in the light of the setting sun.  Lying outside that night the stars and planets were brilliant before the full moon rose, and when it did, it''s light was bright enough to show the colors of the cactus and the red walls of the peaks.  The silence was intense.  Sunrise brought another show of equal majesty.\r\n<p>The next day I did hike in Growler Canyon, and couldn''t miss the Border Patrol station, given that it''s presence was announced by large signs on the gravel road 100 yards away on either side saying, so help me, "Border Patrol Ahead."\r\n<p>As it happens, I did find one obvious "illegals" trail while I was hiking in the park.  It came through Growler Canyon, and was clearly marked with plastic water bottles and failed footwear here and there along the way.  \r\n<p>And it ran within 150 yards of the Border Patrol station.\r\n\r\n<p><i>To read more <b>Wilderness Journal</b> entries, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=28''>here</a>.\r\n             \r\n\r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

To get a good night''s sleep, you need Big Agnes.', '<i>[Last week I was hiking in Arizona and writing on what I experienced there.  This is the last entry on that topic and I will return to blogging on technology issues tomorrow.]</i>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the great joys of hiking in the desert is sleeping under the brilliant, ever-present stars and the even more prominent planets, accompanied by gentle breezes, the smells of the desert, and often, the serenade of coyotes.  In the crystalline air far from the light of cities, the dazzle of the stars and planets is unparalleled, and the experience one to savor.\r\n\r\n<p>There are other sights and sounds as well, especially when camping near an air force bases (which is likely to be the case, given how many are spread around the Southwest, and the fact that the word "near," in this context, can mean pretty far away).  Last night four jets streaked and wheeled overhead while I looked up at the sky, two almost wingtip to wingtip, and the second pair much farther apart, and farther ahead.  Each had strobe lights that flashed in a manic syncopation reminiscent of a 1970''s disco.  Others flew silently at supersonic speeds at extreme altitude, seeming to travel more swiftly than could be possible.\r\n\r\n<p>All of which is well and good, if one can look forward after tiring of the show to a good, solid night''s sleep.  For that, you sometimes need Big Agnes.\r\n\r\n<p>But first, some background.\r\n\r\n<p>In some ways, it''s surprising that I still enjoy camping.  When I first started sleeping out as a boy scout in the early 1960''s, modern camping equipment was unknown.  Gear came from a sporting goods store or perhaps Sears Roebuck, and was all the same wherever you bought it, anyway.  Our first tent was what was referred to as a "pup tent," (I have no idea why), and was made of heavy, stiff canvas.  If you were really serious, you could order better gear from L.L.Bean, which in those days was a single-location store of about 1/10th its current size, and actually an outfitter, rather than a clothing emporium that keeps a few expensive fishing rods around for atmosphere.  \r\n\r\n<p>Wherever you got your gear (other than from L.L.Bean), a pack was a sack with canvas straps that sought to divide your shoulders from the rest of your body when it was full, and a sleeping bag was a also a sack, of the rectangular persuasion, that (a) cost about 20 bucks, (b) was probably lined with flannel, and (c) used cotton batting as insulation. Even camping gear so basic that someone growing up today would assume Noah carried off the Ark was unknown â€“ no pack frames, or even what would pass as a usable camp mattress (you could, to be fair, buy a narrow rubber and canvas inflatable mattress that resembled a pool float, and then spend the rest of the night trying not to slide off of it). \r\n\r\n<p>Camping, therefore, provided neither an opportunity to make a fashion statement nor an occasion to indulge in a love of gadgetry.  Nor, for that matter, did it even offer to most mortals a realistic hope of getting a good night''s sleep â€“ especially in winter.\r\n\r\n<p>In consequence, my own early experiences in camping always went something like this:  <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Act I <i> (In which the subject of our drama turns in with trepidation)</i>:</b> Pitch tent, lay out sleeping bag, cook and eat burnt food, hack around for awhile, put on long underwear, shirt, pants, and two pairs of socks.  Fall asleep.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Act II<i> (In which the Gods of Camping begin to toy with our hero)</i>:</b>  Wake up one half hour later covered in sweat.  Take off shirt, pants, socks and long johns.  Fall back asleep.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Act III<i> (In which the Gods of Camping call all their friends in to share the fun)</i>:</b>   Wake up shivering; put clothing back on and huddle in sleeping bag.  Fall asleep for one half hour.  Wake up shivering and put on any other clothing one can find.  Try unsuccessfully to get back to sleep.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Act IV <i> (In which our hero realizes that his heroic and tragic destiny must be faced)</i>:</b> Confirm that there is no more clothing to put on.  Get up and chop wood until dawn in order to stay warm.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Gods of Camping aside (whose existence may only be inferred rather than proven), the above tragicomedy is a sadly accurate rendition of most of my early camping experiences, other than those in the dead of summer.  \r\n\r\n<p>With time, of course, I got more savvy about such gear as was available, and did lots of backpacking and camping, winter and summer alike.  But as the gear got better, I also got to be a lighter sleeper.  Always, that ephemeral good night''s sleep lay just beyond my grasp, even though various companies came to realize that there was a lot of money to be made from offering high tech camping gear that promised to make comfortable camping a snap.\r\n\r\n<p>So it was that about fifteen years ago I bought my first down sleeping bag.  It handily solved the temperature problem, even on pretty cold nights, and it was light enough for back packing to boot (if you could stuff it into a sack smaller than a Volkswagen Bug).  But by then, mummy bags had become the norm, and while I may have been warm, I also felt as confined as a mummy.  Sleeping in my usual elbow-out, arm under the pillow, knee out to the side position was impossible, even though I was (and still am)slim.  Moreover, rolling over in a mummy bag is an athletic experience, and difficult to pull off absent a fair degree of exertion and liberal muttering of whatever selection of words you find to be most useful and appropriate in situations of this type.\r\n\r\n<p>Thus it was that before heading West this time, I was determined to find a sleeping bag that would be not only warm, practical in size, and sufficiently roomy to sleep in using whatever position I chose, but which would permit my shifting my position without breaking a sweat. Naturally, I turned to the Web to investigate my alternatives.\r\n\r\n<p>I soon found that rectangular sleeping bags still exist.  Now, they are sold by K-Mart, Wal-Mart and on-line vendors that probably buy their goods from the same overseas sweatshops.  Each one (still) (a) costs about 20 bucks, (b) is probably lined with flannel, and (c)uses cotton batting as insulation.  So much for that.\r\n\r\n<p>So the next question was whether I could find something in between â€“ light and warm, but also reasonably roomy.  I looked with increasing discouragement at site after site, each of which offered only high-end straitjackets or low-end rectangular ice chests.\r\n\r\n<p>Until suddenly I came to a new Website, and there she was â€“ the mummy sleeping bag line of my dreams. And this product line had a memorable name to match: "Big Agnes." \r\n\r\n<p>I suppose I shouldn''t have been surprised to find her, given our Super Sized nation.  With 300 million people now, there must be a need for camping gear for the, how to say, "fully figured" camper (both male and female).  The matchmaking site where I met my own particular Big Agnes included helpful statistics for girth as well as height (mine, not hers), as well as her over-all proportions.  Besides having great vital statistics and room to move, Big Agnes has many other becoming features as well: her bottom is a full length sleeve, into which you can slide, not a paltry 20" wide sleeping pad, but a full 25" number.  \r\n\r\n<p>It was love at first sight.  Needless to say, my fingers fairly flew to place the cursor over the shopping cart icon, and lovingly give it a click. \r\n\r\n<p>So it was that this week, with the greatest of anticipation, and for the very first time, I lay myself down on the desert floor, stared up at the stars blazing overhead, and fell blissfully to sleep, cradled in the warm, welcoming, ample bosom of Big Agnes.\r\n\r\n<p><i>To read more <b>Wilderness Journal</b> entries, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=28''>here</a>.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a</b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Which is why I never take them.', '<i>[Last week I was hiking in Arizona and blogging on what I experienced there.]</i>\r\n\r\n<p>As I''ve grown older I''ve come to dislike hiking trails -- which is one of the many reasons that I''ve grown to love the American Southwest.  Here, you can find vast stretches of public land that seem to extend virtually forever, to the horizon and beyond, all sufficiently sparsely vegetated that you can strike out in any direction you wish.  As a result, when one canyon or another piques your fancy, there is nothing to prevent you from simply parking your car and climbing into it, taking as much gear and food as you need to explore for an hour, a day or a week.\r\n\r\n<p>What you find may disappoint as well as please, but the scenery is so compelling that "disappointment" is a relative term.  But considering that wherever you decide to venture the terrain will be challenging and interesting, the worst that can happen is that the way becomes impassable sooner than planned, or that the degree of drama never unfolds to quite the degree that you hoped.  When this happens (which it does when you''re hiking off the beaten track), what you do encounter will still be fresh and unexpected.  And you''ll never see a soul along the way.\r\n\r\n<p>A trail, in contrast, provides the opposite type of experience.  You probably know in advance how long it is (to the tenth of a mile), what the vertical rise you''ll encounter will be, and even the rating of its degree of difficulty.  You can also usually assume that the rough places will have been made smoother, and that the steep places will have been made more tolerable through switchbacks.  And you''ll also know what the "attractions" will be (e.g., a waterfall), as well as what will be your reward when you reach the end â€“ a mountaintop view that will let you see X number of states or a lake to camp by, perhaps. You''ll also almost certainly see other hikers, unless you''re hiking early in the morning (always a good idea for many reasons), or on a weekday in the off-season.  The footsteps and other evidence of those that came before, of course, will still be everywhere.\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps most insidiously, there is this: someone else has decided what you are going to see every step of the way, as well as what you could have seen nearby, but won''t.\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, there are places where trails are advisable, or even necessary.  In forested parts of the country, most people would find traveling any distance to be either laborious or an invitation to becoming lost, and in fragile ecosystems with high visitation too much individualism would damage the environment to an unacceptable.  But wherever I can strike out on my own, I do, and I''m constantly surprised by the gaggle of cars parked by trail heads that give access to scenery no more appealing than that to be found in any other direction - and the same scenery that everyone else has seen.  No more, and no less.\r\n\r\n<p>I can''t help wondering whether this is not all of a piece with our modern life of managed expectations.  Recreation is increasingly compartmentalized, regulated, sliced into convenient time slots, and ennabled â€“ usually for a fee.  The result is guaranteed satisfaction every time â€“ but no surprises, whether it be in the form of a day of skiing at Hatstack or a week of hiking the huts in the White Mountains.  True, there are more people practicing "extreme sports" in off-trail places, but many of these exploits have more to do with the physical challenge than with appreciating where that challenge is being experienced.\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings me, at last, to a metaphor that occurred to me today as I roamed through the Table Top Wilderness area, a 34,000 acre preserve that is itself part of the much larger Saguaro National Monument, just North of the Tohono O''odham reservation.  That metaphor involves the flower of the Ocotillo â€“ to me, the most beautiful desert flower of all, and also one of the most evanescent.\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the year, an Ocotillo is a spray of spindly dry, spine-covered sticks rising from a common base to a height of up to 20 feet, and have from one dozen to six times that many branches.  When not in bloom (which is most of the time), they fade into the landscape, their grey-black bark blending into the background. \r\n\r\n<p>Unlike some flowering plants and shrubs in the desert that bloom only in season, the Ocotillo is an opportunist.  While it will usually bloom between March and June, whenever a meaningful amount of rain falls during the year, it will spring into action, taking advantage of the fortuitous event to meet its solar energy needs, and also to grow and set another crop of seeds.  In a matter of days, <a href=''http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/bto/desertecology/ocot2.htm#top''>small leaves</a> of a rich green spring forth, reaching out on all sides of every branch along it''s entire length.  And at the very tip of every branch, an explosion of <a href=''http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/bto/desertecology/ocot3.htm#top''>exotic blossoms</a> springs from a single apike up to 10 inches long, waving in the breeze like a scarlet handkerchief. \r\n\r\n<p>When in full bloom, an Ocotillo looks almost as if a host of brilliant, red hummingbirds are sipping from the end of each delicate, green branch.  Not surprisingly, a grove of Ocotillos in bloom is almost always the most striking thing to be found in the desesrt landscape.\r\n\r\n<p>A week after the rain falls, though, the show is over. Tthe leaves are shed to avoid losing too much moisture through transpiration.  The blossoms rapidly whither and fade to a dull red as well, eventually falling away entirely.\r\n\r\n<p>Unless you live in the desert (or have a free schedule and a private jet), catching the Ocotillo in bloom other than in Spring is a gift â€“ something always unexpected and welcome, and never to be anticipated.  I''ve only caught the Ocotillo in full bloom out of season twice, most memorably after topping a ridge with my family as we descended towards Joshua Tree National Park in California at dusk.  Suddenly, we found ourselves surrounded on every side by scarlet blossoms on startlingly green plants, brilliant even in the shadow cast by the mountains behind us.  It was a magic moment, made more so in contrast to the many times I''ve arrived  just too late â€“ and found nothing but withered, dry flowers dangling from the tips of dry sticks.\r\n\r\n<p>In consequence, catching the Ocotillos in bloom is a rare treat â€“ something to be savored and remembered.\r\n\r\n<p>And that is where the metaphor of the Ocotillo comes into play in the context of this essay, providing the contrast to the guaranteed satisfaction that we have come to expect, and the tame pleasures that prepackaged attractions provide â€“ including when hiking.  To find a waterfall unexpectedly gives far greater pleasure than to see one across a valley that may, or may not, compare as impressively as hoped with the picture in the trail guide.  In other words, when you always know that you will find an Ocotillo in full bloom, they quickly become unremarkable, and provide a pale reflection of the excitement that comes when you stumble upon them unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, there are few waterfalls to be found unexpectedly in most landscapes, and this is especially so in the desert.

Here''s an update on the latest news:\r\n\r\n<p><b>Peter Quinn gives an interview to Groklaw:</b>  As you''ll recall, Massachusetts CIO and ODF champion Peter Quinn announced his <a href=''http://consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1863''>resignation</a> on Christmas Eve.  He''s kept a low profile ever since â€“ and many (myself included) wondered whether he was sufficiently sick of the whole mess that he would go gentle into the good night of apolitical life.\r\n\r\n<p>Any doubt on that question ended yesterday, when Peter decided to let loose some very explicit rage in his <a href=''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060123132416703''>first interview</a> since announcing his resignation, appropriately given to Pamela Jones at Groklaw, who has championed both his cause, as well as castigated the Globe for its <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1805''>ill-starred</a> inquiry into Quinn''s travel to conferences.  You should read the whole interview at Groklaw, but here are some (although not all) highlights:\r\n\r\n<p> -  The "last straw" for Peter was a move in the State legislature to hold back an IT bond approval while letting the rest of the bond package go through â€“ in retaliation, Peter believes, for the ITD''s handling of its new IT policy.\r\n\r\n<p> - While Quinn refers to State Senator Pacheco as a "bully," he believes that it was Microsoft, and not Pacheco (or anyone else on Beacon Hill) that suggested to <i>Globe</i> reporter Steve Kurkjian that he should look into Quinn''s travel documentation. \r\n\r\n<p> - Peter did not have an outstanding job offer when he quit, but is beginning to meet with those that would like to meet with him.\r\n\r\n<p> - He expects the ODF decision to hold, although he also notes: "I believe MS will continue to do anything and everything it can to stop it. And I know my seat wasn''t even empty and they (MS) took another shot at the title, to no avail. This horse is out of the barn and I see no way for it to go back in."\r\n\r\n<p>Peter''s answers in the interview are, to but it mildly, both candid and unrestrained.  Here''s an example: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>PJ:</b> Do you know who inspired the Globe to do the investigation? Was it Pacheco?\r\n\r\n<p><b>Quinn:</b>Almost to a person, to anybody involved or who knows about the ODF issue, they attributed the story to Microsoft, right, wrong or otherwise. Senator Pacheco may be a bully but I do not believe he is disingenuous and would stoop to such a tactic. Senator Pacheco and Secretary Galvin''s office remain very heavily influenced by the Microsoft money and its lobbyist machine, as witnessed by their playbook and words, in my opinion. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, Peter is relishing his new role as a private citizen.  He also indicates in the interview that he will continue to speak candidly in a number of already planned speaking arrangements about what "open" should mean, and what happened in Massachusetts over the last six months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>More Mush from the Wimp:</b> As you may recall, Corel surprised everyone last October by announcing that it would <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1663''>not support ODF</a>  in the next version of its flagship WordPerfect product.

Here are the issues and milestones that I''ll be watching, the state of play of each on as I understand it, and the approximate date to look for an announcement on each:\r\n\r\n<p><b>Morrissey Amendment:  </b>On November 2, 2005, word reached the public that an <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1699''>amendment</a> to an economic stimulus bill had been introduced by Senator Michael Morrissey in the Massachusetts Senate that would radically shift policy making power away from the ITD to a political task force.  The text of that amendment was later modified somewhat, but the bill was not enacted into law before the legislature adjourned for the holidays.\r\n\r\n<p>The legislature is now back in session, and I am told that this portion of the economic stimulus bill to which the amendment relates will now begin getting attention, now that debate on another part of the same bill (involving health care) has been resolved.  The next step will be for the economic bill (with or without the amendment) to be approved by each branch of the legislature.  Following this, a reconciliation committee will be formed, and the final bill will then presumably be approved by both houses.  Finally, the Governor would need to sign the bill â€“ and can veto it if he chooses.\r\n\r\n<p>Will all this happen?  I have talked to several people in the know who believe that the amendment will not survive.  And, in fact, it is easy to identify many obvious enemies, and few obvious proponents to speak in its favor.  In essence, the amendment would shift great power to the Secretary of the Commonwealth''s Office, and, by definition, leave less power for other individuals and offices to share in comparison â€“ including the Governor, who continues to support the ODF policy.  Moreover, the current version of the amendment would take away IT policy power from all of the municipalities of the Commonwealth â€“ a breathtaking move for which there is no precedent and little excuse.  It is hard to imagine that any local CIO would welcome this outcome.\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, I have learned that support for the ODF policy continues to be expressed from public, as well as private parties. Within the last month, letters of opposition to approval of the task force contemplated by the amendment have been sent to multiple legislators by three of the major Massachusetts technology trade associations: the Massachusetts Network Communications Council (MNCC), Mass High Technology Council (MHTC) and the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council (MTLC).\r\n\r\n<p>I have received copies of these letters, and here are representative quotes taken from them.  First, from the MHTC letter, signed by its President, Christopher R. Anderson: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The state''s current transparent audit process for reviewing IT decisions works very well and is viewed as the direction in which national IT procurement models are heading.  The proposed new task force would create a bureaucratic bottleneck that would result in procurement inefficiencies for the Commonwealth and should be rejected by the conference committee. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>And this, from the MNCC letter, signed by its Executive Director, Carol J. Meier: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n-  The Task Force will be unable to objectively evaluate procurement decisions\r\n<br>-  The Task Force will slow decision-making down, or force it to a halt, delaying adoption of critical productivity technologies\r\n<br>-  The Task Force will tend to single-vendor solutions, subject to the influence of the suppliers with the greatest political leverage.  New entrants or innovators may not be able to propose their products and services\r\n<br>-  The Task Force creates jurisdictional and constitutional issues regarding interfaces and authorities of existing government agencies and branches in Massachusettsâ€¦\r\n<p>We urge you to strike this Amendment </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, there are few inherent reasons one can imagine why legislators would wish to approve the amendment (other than to please lobbyists and Secretary William Francis Galvin), once they thoroughly understand the issues.  We should know more on where this will go within the next thirty days. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Auditor''s Office:</b>  A detail from the October 31, 2005 <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1696''>hearing</a> held by Senator Marc R. Pacheco, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Post Audit and Oversight, that most have forgotten is that Senator Pacheco requested the Audit Office to evaluate a cost analysis that had been conducted by the ITD with respect to the cost of implementing ODF,  and the process that had been used by the ITD in adopting the ODF standard, as earlier submitted by the ITD.  That analysis had indicated that significant cost savings could be achieved by implementing the ITD''s proposal.\r\n\r\n<p>The auditor has not yet issued a report on this matter, but can be expected to do so sometime over the next few months if he continues on the originally contemplated schedule.  If the result of that evaluation is to confirm that implementation of ODF would, as asserted by then State CIO Peter Quinn, result in significant savings, it would be much more difficult to justify a roll back of the ODF decision.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Pacheco Hearing: </b>If usual procedures are followed, the Senate Committee on Post Audit and Oversight will certainly issue a decision as a follow up to the October 31  hearing referred to above.  That decision can be expected to address: (1) the legal issues addressed by Senator Pacheco at the hearing to which ITD General Counsel Linda Hamel responded then, and in a subsequent brief that she submitted to the Committee, and (2) the Auditors evaluation referred to above.  For this reason, the Committee decision would not be expected to issue until <b><i>after the Auditor''s evaluation has been completed and presented.</b></i> \r\n\r\n<p><b>Disability issues: </b> The ability of ODF to match, or surpass, the capacity of MS Office to accommodate those with disabilities remains an important test for implementation.  Last week, Thomas Trimarco, the Massachusetts Secretary of Administration and Finance, delivered a to representatives of the community of persons with disabilities stating that an evaluation will be made in mid 2006 to determine whether applications supporting ODF are likely to provide an acceptable alternative to MS Office for State employees with disabilities.  If that need is not met by mid 2006, then the effective date of ODF implementation will be lagged as necessary until it is judged adequate to this task.\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, work continues within OASIS to give final approval to and launch the new working group which will be chartered to facilitate use of applications supporting ODF by those with disabilities.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Leadership:</b>  Following Peter Quinn''s Christmas Eve announcement that he would <a href=''http://consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1863''>resign as CIO</a>, it was made public on January 6 that Secretary Trimarco (Quinn''s immediate superior) had appointed ITD COO Bethan Pepoli as the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1904''>interim CIO</a> and head of the ITD.  Ms. Pepoliâ€™s title implies that Secretary Trimarco may appoint a permanent CIO, and that Ms. Pepoli may be in the running for this position.  \r\n\r\n<p>The identity of the permanent CIO is important, because presumably some deference will be given to the opinion of the CIO who will be responsible for implementing (or not) the ODF policy.\r\n\r\n<p>I have been told by a number of people in the know that Ms. Pepoli is a friend, and not a foe, of the ODF policy.  Given that at this point there remain only 8 months before a new Governor will be elected (Mitt Romney has announced that he will not stand for reelection), it would presumably be difficult to attract a forceful candidate from the outside to take such a (presumably) short-term engagement, and that it would be unlikely that any candidate would be chosen that would be likely to take a strong stand against an policy so recently by the Governor''s office.\r\n\r\n<p>Given how short a period of time remains before the November election, anticipate an announcement on a permanent CIO (Ms. Pepoli or someone else) within the next thirty days.\r\n\r\n<p><b>ISO Adoption of ODF:</b>  OASIS, the developer of the ODF standard, submitted it to ISO for adoption as a global standard on September 30, 2005.  While final approval of ODF by ISO is not essential to adoption by Massachusetts, that step will give ODF additional credibility in comparison to the Microsoft XML Reference Schema (XMLRS), which was not <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1795''>submitted to Ecma</a>, a European standards body, late last year, and is not expected to reach ISO for at least another year. \r\n\r\n<p>Under the ISO "publicly available specification" (PAS) process used by OASIS for ODF, and which would be used by Ecma for XMLRS, balloting is held open for six months, following which a committee reconciles (under its own authority) any comments included with any votes submitted.  The reconciliation process should begin in <b><i>May of 2006</b></i>, meaning that ODF should achieve adoption <b><i>next summer</b></i> - at least a year to 18 months before XMLRS could be expected to achieve a similar status, and be considered on an equal footing in (for example) Europe with ODF.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Summary:</b> While there are significant events to watch for over the next year, the only two which, in my judgment, represent a significant impediment to a timely effective date for ODF on January 1, 2007 are these:  making adequate progress on meeting accessibility needs, and confirmation by the State Auditor that the ITD''s cost analysis was sound.  \r\n\r\n<p> With respect to the first, major players, such as IBM and Sun Microsystems, are betting heavily on ODF, and will be providing urgency and assistance in this regard in order to keep momentum for ODF adoption, both in Massachusetts and elsewhere, strong.  Whether that means making sufficiently substantial progress by mid-summer to avoid a delay in the effective date remains to be seen, and bears watching.\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to the second, confirmation of the cost benefits would provide powerful support.  It is important to note, however, that the Auditor is not doing its own cost analysis, but rather evaluating whether the ITD''s mode of analysis was properly conducted.  Hence, a negative finding does not mean that cost savings would not follow, but rather that they had not yet been established â€“ a lapse that can be cured.\r\n\r\n<p> As always, I will keep you informed on each of these issues as they mature.\r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Happily, it appears that the latter is the case.  That is, unless the <i>Globe</i> story was a set up.', 'It has been interesting observing how lobbying works at the state level as the ODF situation has developed here in Massachusetts. The types of antics engaged in by those who log in their expense vouchers on K Street normally seem far away from most state capitals, but I expect that''s because the level of scrutiny is much lower in the provinces than inside the Beltway.  \r\n\r\n<p>At issue here in the Bay State is whether the legislature will approve an amendment to an economic stimulus bill that would take IT policy power away from the state''s own Information Technology Division (ITD) and transfer it to a politically appointed task force.  The impetus for the amendment was the adoption last year by the ITD of a new technology policy that would involve the roll out of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for use by the Executive agencies of the Commonwealth.  The announcement of that policy provoked a strong reaction from some quarters, including Microsoft, which fears the loss of market share for its flagship Office productivity suite if proprietary and open source implementations of ODF become popular, as well as with some members of the community of the disabled, who are concerned whether products that support ODF will meet their needs.\r\n\r\n<p>The rationale for lobbying has always been that it is necessary to inform legislators, who must enact laws that cover the gamut of all possible issues, of relevant facts that can guide them in making good decisions.  And, of course, the First Amendment right of free speech (which includes commercial free speech) has long been held to protect this type of speech as well.\r\n\r\n<p>So what have I seen so far on Beacon Hill, and how does it compare to what is being exposed in Washington?  \r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line is that while the action has been spirited, I''m pleased to say that so far the game play appears to have been aggressive, but clean.  Here''s a recap:\r\n\r\n<p>First, I have not heard even one suggestion from anyone of any fiscal impropriety of any sort.  So to begin with, let me make it clear that I have no reason to think that anything (with the possible exception of the still-unanswered question of how the <i>Globe </i> story came about) has been done by anyone on either side of the issue that has been in any way legally improper or that would rise to the level of a "dirty trick." This is not to say, however, that there has not been ample evidence of spreading much disinformation, both privately as well as publicly, as evidenced by some of the statements made in the <a href=''http://www.mass.gov/Aitd/docs/policies_standards/''>public comment letters</a> that can still be viewed at the ITD''s public website.  Many of these letters assert, or repeat assertions about the ITD''s plans that at no time were ever included in its proposed policy.\r\n\r\n<p>Second, it also is clear that the legislators that have spoken publicly (and in all likelihood the great majority of those in the Massachusetts legislature) or that wrote comment letters to the Information Technology Division (ITD) have very little technical awareness or preexisting knowledge of the technical issues involved.  Senator Pacheco, one of the principal actors in the drama and the Chair of the Senate Post Audit Committee, freely admits that he really knows nothing at all about either open standards or open source, much less what an document format really is.\r\n\r\n<p>Third, I am told that Microsoft was "all over" the relevant legislators well before representatives of ODF proponents, such as IBM and Sun, knocked on their doors.  As a result, Microsoft got their version of the story out first, and IBM and Sun were in the position of having to displace the story line that Microsoft presented.  Proponents of ODF, however, have made substantial progress since then in one-on-one meetings with important legislators.  \r\n\r\n<p>One of the more intriguing questions is whether State Secretary William Francis Galvin came up with the idea of creating a Task Force to transfer greater policy power to his office on his own, or whether this was suggested to him by lobbyists who saw an opportunity to bait the hook.  Given the existing reputation of he who is often locally referred to as The Dark Prince (Galvin), I have no reason to think that he needed any assistance in concocting this gambit.\r\n\r\n<p>Both sets of corporate adversaries have also tried to make the point that keeping them happy would not be a bad goal for Beacon Hill.  Both IBM and Sun sent letters of support to the Governor''s office for the ITD''s position, and each letter recited the number of employees they have in the Bay State in pointed terms.\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft, on the other hand (which had no development facilities in the Bay State before acquiring Ray Ozzie''s Groove Networks recently), has lately been running a set of rather odd ads touting its extensive "developer ecosystem" (i.e., its partner network) in Massachusetts, and trying to create the impression that somehow this network conveys great value to the Commonwealth (of course, IBM and Sun, which each have thousands of employees in Massachusetts, have partner programs as well).  These ads - featuring the picture of Ray Ozzie himself - have been running in venues such as the Boston <i>Globe''s</i> editorial page, and in the <i>Boston Business Journal</i>.\r\n\r\n<p>One development that has provoked much comment and suspicion is whether Microsoft incited the community of the disabled to become as involved as they have in their own lobbying efforts.  Many have leapt to the assumption that the trail for this activity must lead back to Redmond.  In point of fact, however, the community of the disabled maintains a very active on-line network of communication, and actively follow accessibility issues.  Given that many are also Massachusetts state employees, there is no need to assume that they were unaware of the ITD''s policy, or would not want to know what its implementation would mean to them.  \r\n\r\n<p>As a result, while it is possible that their attention was directed at the inclusion of ODF in the ITD''s new policy, that is not at all a necessary, or even a likely, conclusion, and certainly should not be taken as a given absent some proof to that effect.  Whether the disabled were delivered any misinformation as the accessibility issue heated up is a more interesting question, but not one that I can speak to. Thus far, I''ve seen and heard nothing concrete to that effect.\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, one could make the argument that in some ways the lobbying and related activities that the forces, both pro and con, have engaged in over the last six months have actually been a good example of how a lobbying effort can work, in its own, quirky, self-interested, and vexing way, if one is going to allow lobbying at all.  What we''ve seen is that many legislators have received letters, been visited by advocates of both sides, have had the opportunity to attend two public meetings (one a hearing, and one an informational meeting), and have seen an amendment (thus far) in two different forms.\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the media and bloggers have paid sufficient attention to the issue that key legislators and state officers are being contacted by the press, which requires them to look into what the issues are and develop policy and positions.\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, a wide swathe of the public has become engaged in the process, and has had a chance to hear what both sides have said, how they have said it, and whether it makes sense.  Those voters are watching what is going on, and note will be taken of who votes for what on Beacon Hill.\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, at the end of the day, the question is why the legislature became involved to begin with.  After all, it already has a large and experienced technology infrastructure whose managers are charged with making cogent technology decisions and adopting appropriate standards.  What reason is there for legislators to need to become educated about such technical issues at all?\r\n\r\n<p>Up to a point, there is a rationale, which relates at a high level to maintaining appropriate checks and balances, and ensuring that public monies are appropriately spent.  This is why, for example, the State Auditors office is not performing its own cost analysis of the ITD''s implementation of ODF, but rather evaluating the ITD''s analysis to determine whether it was appropriately conducted, and whether its conclusions may safely be relied upon.  \r\n\r\n<p>But imposing a task force of political appointees, only a few of whom would be required under the amendment in its current form to have any technical expertise at all, hardly seems to be the answer.  This would be more in the realm of usurpation of power, rather than ensuring quality of decision making.  And while lobbyists may have put those behind the proposed amendment onto the issue to begin with, it''s not necessary to assume that lobbyists engaged in the K Street practice of drafting the amendment as well.\r\n\r\n<p>So at the end of the day, here''s my score card: on the plus side, so far as anything I''ve read or been told so far, the lobbying has been pretty clean (as such things go), and when all of this is finally settled, the citizens and legislators will be better informed about intelligent IT policy than they were before.  Hopefully, the original ODF decision will continue to hold, and ODF will not actually be implemented until the needs of the disabled are met â€“ a positive result. \r\n\r\n<p>The public debate has also nudged Microsoft into offering its XML Reference Schema to Ecma.  And while that offer was on conditions that would effectively require rubber stamp adoption by the Ecma working group formed to present it for a vote, it is still a first step towards opening up the formats upon which Office is based.\r\n\r\n<p>But on the negative side, the treatment of former Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn has been inexcusable, and may cast a long shadow on the efforts of other state CIOs to adopt innovative and necessary IT policies.  We can''t blame that on the lobbyists, though â€“ the hatchet men of Beacon Hill were quite able enough to come up with these attacks all on their own.\r\n\r\n<p>The final question then is, What about the <i>Globe</i> story?  Whether or not that can be traced back to Microsoft â€“ or more likely a Microsoft lobbyist â€“ is the question that will ultimately determine whether the lobbying efforts on Beacon Hill can lay a claim to meeting K Street standards.  \r\n\r\n<p>If that proves to be the case, Jack Abramoff would be proud.\r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The appointment is effective on February 6, 2006.\r\n\r\n<p>Gutierrez will be responsible for overseeing the final stages of implementation of the state''s new Open Document format proposal, to go into effect in January 2007.\r\n\r\n<p>"Information technology is an important tool that helps to deliver a wide range of government services both quickly and cost effectively," said Trimarco. "Louis Gutierrez has a distinguished record in both the private and public sectors and brings a keen understanding of information technology''s mission and its potential."\r\n\r\n<p>Bethann Pepoli, who has served as the departmentï¿½s acting chief information officer, will become deputy chief information officer. Gutierrez will leave his current position as chief technology strategist at the Commonwealth Medicine Division of UMass Medical School in order to accept the appointment. While at UMass Medical, Gutierrez directed a team that provided technology support during Operation Helping Hand, the state assistance effort for Hurricane Katrina evacuees who came to Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to working at UMass Medical Gutierrez was chief information officer for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services (HHS), the largest state secretariat with 23,000 staff and more than $12 billion in annual spending. While at HHS Gutierrez led the development and implementation of the state''s Virtual Gateway, an online portal that integrated the web presence of 16 agencies into a user-friendly format that improved service delivery and reduced costs.\r\n\r\n<p>"The Virtual Gateway is an example of how state government computing can be transformed through the application of open standards that interoperate with many kinds of technology and vendors," said Gutierrez. "As technology continues to evolve there remain substantial opportunities to transform services and a need to plan for the long-term future of technology-infused operations."\r\n\r\n<p>A former principal at the Exeter Group, an IT strategy and integration services firm, Gutierrez has held a number of top IT positions, including chief information officer at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and deputy director for technology planning and standards for the Federal Reserve system. He is a former Commonwealth of Massachusetts chief information officer.\r\n\r\n<p>A graduate of Harvard College and MIT''s Sloan School of Management, Gutierrez lives in Arlington with his wife and their two daughters.\r\n\r\n<p><center>* * * * * * *</center>\r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

It looks like that bet is paying off.', 'It''s no secret that Mitt Romney wants to be president.  That means he knows that everything he does and says will be under the microscope, and every decision he makes is an opportunity to further his ambitions - or a chance to call the toss wrong and lose the game.  Surprisingly enough, a technical standard has presented one such decision to Romney, and the stakes for calling the toss right for his presidential ambitions may be high.\r\n\r\n<p>Massachusetts has been in the middle of a fracas for the past six months that has not only pitted factions of the state government against each other, but also set the largest IT companies in the world in opposition as well.  The battle involves a technology standard called OpenDocument Format (ODF), which the State is to implement on January 1, 2007.  When the champion of that policy, Massachusetts State CIO Peter Quinn, abruptly announced his <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1863''>resignation</a> on Christmas Eve last year, the man that appointed him had two choices: duck and cover, or gamble that toughing it out would be a shrewd political decision.\r\n\r\n<p>That man, of course, is Mitt Romney, and the easiest path available to him  was to say that he wished to consult with Quinn''s successor about his or her recommendation, and then simply drag his feet in making that appointment as his term as governor rapidly expired.  \r\n\r\n<p>The riskier path was to stick with his policy, and announce that he would not give in to local forces, including Secretary of the Commonwealth William Francis Galvin (affectionately known locally as the "Dark Prince"), or to "special interests" - in this case Microsoft, which has directed its substantial lobbying forces to heading off ODF at the pass in Massachusetts, lest the virus of implementation spread to other states â€“ because ODF is a format for office productivity suites, and directly threatens Microsoft''s vastly lucrative monopoly in that market.\r\n\r\n<p>Romney seemed to waver at first, when a spokesman welcomed as positive the news that Microsoft had submitted its rival XML Reference Schema to Ecma for approval as a standard, but then the statements by members of his administration suddenly firmed up, and announcement followed announcement indicating that he would hold firm in his support for ODF.\r\n\r\n<p>What happened?  \r\n\r\nHere''s what makes sense to me, as I explained it in an <a href='' http://www.publish.com/article2/0,1895,1917510,00.asp''>interview</a> I gave to Lisa Vaas at Publish.com after Romney''s office issued a press release announcing that Quinn''s successor would be <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/''> Louis  Gutierrez</a>: <blockquote>\r\n"The whole press release is clearly being used as a vehicle to convey the strong support of Romney for ODF," [Updegrove] said. \r\n<p>The reason Romney is investing political capital in a technological debate likely has to do with Romney''s intention to run for president in the next election, Updegrove suggested. \r\n<p>First, because Romney has continued to be asked about the ODF controversy, he had to decide how to come down on it, and he likely wouldn''t want to be seen as flip-flopping going into a presidential race. \r\n<p>Second, the Abrahamoff [sic] scandal is likely influencing Romney, as politicians become leery of succumbing to aggressive lobbying, Updegrove said. \r\n<p>"What with the Abrahamoff scandal, and with Microsoft pushing very hard for a reversal, would you rather look like you''re giving in to a special interest or would you rather look like you''re standing up to a special interest?" he saidâ€¦.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nLest I focus only on the presumed <i>realpolitik</i> of Romney''s strategy, I should also give him credit for, well, standing up to the local politicos and powerful special interests, when ducking and covering would have been so easy to do.  As I said to Vaas in the same interview:<blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd regardless of the political winds that brought Gutierrez to the position, Updegrove said, Romney merits praise for doing the right thing. \r\n<p>"You have a governor who''s deciding what is the smartest thing for [him] to do here, and really, to his credit, he''s doing the right thing," he said. \r\n<p>"He''s standing up to special interests, he''s standing behind the recommendations of the highly skilled professionals that he hired. He''s keeping with a policy, he''s going against the political maneuvering of [Massachusetts Secretary] William Francis Galvin and others on Beacon Hill, [the location of the Massachusetts State House]. He''s sticking with it." </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Decisive and principled - not a bad way to be viewed in a presidential campaign, if that''s how others decide to view Romney''s determination to stay the course as well.  But would the story be reported by the press that way?  And would it break out of the technical press and into the mainstream media?\r\n\r\n<p>It looks like Romney''s bet is already paying off.  Yesterdy, <a href='' http://www.forbes.com/2006/02/01/massachusetts-opendocument-romney-cx_rr_0201autofacescan09.html''> Forbes Magazine</a> (no less) posted a story on Romney and the ODF story at the "Faces in the News" section of its Website that begins: <blockquote>\r\n<p>Goliath software companies and executive resignations are no match for the state of Massachusetts. \r\n\r\n<p>The commonwealth said Monday it would stick to its guns and implement open document software standards in every state government agency. \r\n\r\n<p>Governor Mitt Romney stood by the policy as his Chief Information Officer Peter Quinn resigned over the issue last month, and has put its foot down by saying it wouldn''t natively support the OpenDocument standard in Office 12, due out mid-year. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nGranted, the Forbes reporter is a little unclear about what''s actually going on here at the technical level, but then again, most Massachusetts legislators are, too. The article concludes by commending Massachusetts'' steadfastness in its resolve to stand up to Microsoft, saying: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhen Massachusetts announced its decision to switch over to [ODF, Microsoft] called the move "inconsistent and discriminatory." The mere fact that Microsoft appears irked by the New England state''s plan shows just how powerful a statement Massachusetts is making. \r\n\r\n<p>If one state shows it can run its IT operations just fine while shunning Microsoft''s dominant software products, the door will be left open for other states, organizations and companies to do the same. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So Romney''s decision to stand fast as David against the Goliath of Redmond has begun to succeed in raising his profile nationally.  That''s good for the Governor â€“ and it''s good for everyone that believes in open standards as well.\r\n\r\n<p>And it''s also good in another, less obvious way: it has been repeatedly noted that Romney''s successor will be entitled to replace the state CIO come November, and that the new governor could then abort the ODF transition.\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, that''s true.  But if Romney''s stand continues to draw national publicity, what new governor will want to be seen as giving in to Goliath?  Every day that this story grows, such a reversal will become more politically untenable.\r\n\r\n<p>And one thing more:  it will make it easier for other state CIOs to implement ODF as well, off-setting the chilling impact of the Boston <i>Globe</i> instigated investigation into Peter Quinn''s travel documentation that significantly contributed to his decision to resign as CSO.\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of which:  I''m still waiting for <i>Globe</i> Ombudsman Richard Chacon to fulfill his promise, <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1863''>made on December 12</a>, to look into the matter.

Maintenance is not elective, although the timing and cost of maintenance can at least be scheduled to balance annual costs, absent natural disasters.\r\n\r\n<p>Upgrading, on the other hand, can often be long-delayed, absent competitive pressures.  Every private business, public agency, and utility needs to decide when the benefits of upgrading outweigh the costs, work and inconvenience of making the switch.  \r\n\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, the Internet is no exception to this rule.  Some years ago, the cost of building the infrastructure (routers, fiberoptic cable and so on) upon which the Internet is based was much in the news - as well as the question of whether the buildout of those resources could keep pace with exploding demand.  Now, the infrastructure that supports the Internet and the Web, like the infrastructure of traditional utilities, is largely taken for granted and forgotten by those that depend upon it.  \r\n\r\n<p>In the case of the Internet, however, some significant costs involve upgrading based not upon tangible goods, but upon virtual elements: the standards and protocols upon which the entire system depends.  One of the most important of those protocols is the venerable and aptly named <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol''>Internet Protocol</a> (or IP), which enables not only the operation of the Internet itself, but many of the applications that run on top of it. \r\n\r\n<p>The IP is also a very complex standard, and upgrading the Internet to implement a new version of the IP will be very expensive.  Currently, the Internet runs on IPv4 (and has done so for more than 20 years), even though IPv6 has already been developed.  \r\n\r\n<p>One goal that is now forcing an upgrade to IPv6 is the belief by the U.S. government that upgrading to IPv6 will enhance cybersecurity.  Accordingly, in preparation for the multi-year process of making the upgrade, a Task Force was established by a 2003 directive issued in a White House report, called the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.  That Task Force was charged with determining what it would cost to make the transition, and with assessing the relationship between the cost and various anticipated benefits, such as augmenting national security and economic growth.\r\n\r\n<p>The complexity of making such an evaluation is increased by the fact that the Internet will not simply be switched over from supporting IPv4 to IPv6 some night at midnight, Greenwich Mean Time.  Instead, there will be a dual-use period during which both versions of the IP will be in use.  The Task Force was also therefore charged with thinking about how this protracted transition be accomplished without undue direct cost or undue negative economic impact.\r\n\r\n<p>Now, an 83 page report has been issued by that Task Force, with the title <a href=''http://www.nist.gov/director/prog-ofc/IPv6-final.pdf''>Technical and Economic Assessment of  Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)</a>.  A related <a href=''http://www.nist.gov/director/prog-ofc/report05-2.pdf''> report of estimated transition costs</a>, based on research by RTI International, has been issued by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) as well.\r\n\r\n<p>The report reaches rather sober conclusions, noting (for example) that in the "initial years" security will not be augmented by the upgrade, and that in fact if the transition occurs too soon, security may actually suffer.  At the same time, it anticipates that "most hardware, operating systems, and network-enabled software packages (e.g., databases, email, etc.) will likely include IPv6 capabilities within the next five years."\r\n\r\n<p>The report does anticipate increased innovation as a result of greater availability of name spaces, and notes that at minimum the transition will "future proof" the Internet against address shortages.  Other benefits â€“ none of them revolutionary - are described as well.  At the same time, the report expects that full implementation will take many years, and that "Interoperability needs will be a major consideration in an enterprise''s decision to adopt IPv6." Nonetheless, the report advises limiting costs by implementing IPv6 in the "normal refresh cycle" of upgrading hardware and software that currently supports IPv4.\r\n\r\n<p>The report is also sober in its evaluation of whether the upgraded network will indeed augment security, concluding that "new security paradigms that are significantly different than those commonly employed in today''s networks" will need to be developed at "considerable" expense in order to realize such benefits, and will be preceded by diminished, rather than increased, security.  After 3 â€“ 5 years of implementation roll-out, the report concludes, users "may" see improvements in security.\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the Task Force was charged with determining whether the government would need to play an active part in making the transition happen.  The report concludes that no barriers will exist that would require that government intervene to assist the private sector, and therefore that "aggressive government action to accelerate deployment of IPv6 by the private sector is warranted at this time."\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, one would conclude, upgrading the Internet will be much like all too many other IT upgrades â€“ long, tedious, expensive, doubtful in their ultimate benefits â€“ and ultimately unavoidable.\r\n\r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

I was happy to get the email, because the sender was none other than Alan Cote, the Massachusetts Supervisor of Records.  \r\n\r\n<p>Alan is one of the individuals who has been in the center of the ODF policy debate, and has testified twice in opposition to the Information Technology Division (ITD) policy that mandates use by the Executive Agencies of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) on January 1, 2007.  The first time was at the October 31, 2005 <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30&Result_Set=30''>hearing</a> convened by the Senate Post Audit Committee Chairman, Senator Marc Pacheco, and the second was at the\r\n<a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1825''>open meeting</a> held on December 14, 2005 at the State House in Boston.\r\n\r\n<p>Alan''s role in the ODF debate arises from the fact that he is the Supervisor of Records in the <a href=''http://www.sec.state.ma.us/pre/preidx.htm''>Public Records Division</a>, which is part of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth (the current Secretary is William Francis Galvin, which explains in part why his name has come up so often as the debate unfolded â€“ and why you see his face at the top of so many Webpages with addresses that end with state.ma.us). \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In both times that I''ve heard Alan speak, he has made no secret of the fact that he is not a believer in the implementation of ODF.  I''ve wondered why that would be so each time that I''ve heard him, because the way that the Public Records Division currently archives records is quite laborious.  In consequence, I would have expected Alan to be ready to welcome, not challenge, the ITD''s policy.\r\n\r\n<p>Alan and I spoke by telephone at length on Thursday, and we had quite an interesting discussion.  He also agreed to let me send him a long email interview, which I''ll include in the February issue of the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a>, which will focus on the many "standards wars" that are currently in process, but I wanted to share some of the things he said at this time as a counterpoint to the long list of entries that I''ve posted previously that have largely presented the ODF camp''s side of the Massachusetts story.\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing worth noting, although it is no surprise at this point, is that Alan, as well as some other members of the State government, felt that they were entitled to have been consulted by the ITD far more frequently, and at an earlier date, then in fact they were.  I have heard and read the rationale for the ITD''s decisions and the <a href=''http://consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/11-16-05.php''>basis for its authority</a> in acting as it did (all of which sound convincing to me), but the result was nevertheless that enemies were made along the way as a result of not having pursued a more collaborative process.\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the reason that others in government felt entitled to greater participation may have arisen in part due to what might be considered a "generational" shift (the generations to which I refer are technological, rather than human).  This became apparent from one revealing comment that Alan made about the ITD: "They aren''t really an information office â€“ they''re just about technology."  Quite an intriguing statement, because for those of us that live primarily in the world of technology, "information" today is by nature electronic.  \r\n\r\n<p>But, not surprisingly, to the Public Records Division, still with millions of archived paper documents, "information" isn''t bytes of data, but specific records that are important for what they represent â€“ birth certificates, investigative reports, and so on, that have specific purposes, are subject to public records requests, and will be utilized by historians.  \r\n<p>Of course, that last point is precisely what ODF and the ITD''s policy is all about.  But at minimum there''s a convergence of turf here, and when one part of a government''s authority begins to overlap with another, pursuing even a collaborative approach is apt to be challenging.\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing that was apparent in speaking with Alan is that he is passionate about what he does, and thinks that he has a very good handle on how to go about doing it well.  As I spoke with him, another disconnect between the way he looks at the issues and the way that Peter Quinn saw the future also became clear.  \r\n\r\n<p>That disconnect is this: Alan is living in the present, and the ITD policy addresses the future.  That became apparent when I asked Alan my Big Question: Why isn''t he the biggest fan of ODF in state government?  The answer, I think, is that Alan really doesn''t believe that ODF will deliver on the promises of its proponents, or at least isn''t going to rely on that result until its been proven.  He believes that after the policy goes into effect, he will still need to save every document in several formats on several types of media, and a few years later, do exactly the same thing again.  \r\n\r\n<p>In truth, one does have to buy into the vision of ODF in order to bank on it.  If multiple vendors don''t decide to support ODF in their products, then not much will have been gained (of course, not much will have been lost, either, at least for Alan''s office, which is already saving documents in multiple, proprietary formats).  Ultimately, you have to believe that ODF will be successful before you decide to take the leap, or at least think that it''s worth taking the chance.  More evangelism in advance would have been a smart move in this regard as well, since Alan is concerned (at minimum) about how he will need to work with Executive Agency documents that arrive at his office after January 1, 2007.\r\n\r\n<p>So who was right at those hearings and open meetings - Alan Cote, with his concern for the present, or Peter Quinn, with his belief in the future?  One answer to that question is this: in order for everyone today to enjoy the convenience of telecommunications, someone had to buy the first telephone.  \r\n\r\n<p>Some would counter this question with another: "But should that someone be the government?"  Personally, I don''t think that this is inappropriate, because the government has a responsibility to preserve the records of the people, and that job will stay Herculean unless something like ODF becomes ubiquitous.  Since private companies may be hesitant to buy that first telephone, then why <i>not</i> the government?  Otherwise, whoever is sitting in Alan''s office fifty years from now will still be re-saving documents in three different formats, on three types of media, every five years - forever.\r\n\r\n<p>Alan and I covered quite a bit of additional ground, including the still-pending proposed amendment to the ITD''s authority, and the role of his office in how it is worded.  All of this will be addressed in much greater detail in the email interview.  But for now, I was pleased to hear some of the other side of the story direct from the source, and I hope that perhaps Alan also got some additional perspective on the promise of ODF from our call as well.  \r\n\r\n<p>Alan, I thank you for your time, and look forward to continuing our dialogue in the future.\r\n\r\n<p><center>* * * * * * *</center>\r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

I asked Bob Sutor and Simon Phipps, and they both say, "no way."', '<i>Paul Harvey fans will enjoy reading the "rest of the story" epilogue at the end of this piece, which I added around 3:50 PM EST</i>\r\n\r\n<p>I read a story by Tom Sanders at Vnunet.com yesterday called <a href=''http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2149926/sun-urged-give-openoffice''>Sun urged to give up OpenOffice control</a> that just sounded "wrong," or at least overblown.  The gist of the story is that OpenOffice.org Project Leader Louis Suarez-Potts wants Sun to contribute the copyright in the OpenOffice.org  open source version of ODF to a foundation to be created for the purpose of owning the rights, and that Sun and IBM aren''t getting along.  I''ve gone direct to IBM and Sun to find out whether the Vnunet.com story has it right, and they both say "no."\r\n\r\n<p>First though, let''s look at what it says at Vnunet.com.  The article quotes Suarez-Potts as follows: <blockquote>\r\nIn an ideal world open source should not be dependent on the capriciousness of any one corporation. A foundation does not isolate a project from any one corporation, it provides some distance. But the reality is that it requires Sun to give up the intellectual property to a foundation. That''s a fairly large obstacle. </blockquote>\r\n<p>Reservations of intellectual property rights are quite frequent in all sorts of open standards and open source situations, ranging from Sun''s retaining control of Java to the continuing ownership of patents by Sun and Microsoft in ODF and the XML Reference Schema, respectively, but supported by their statements that they would not assert those patents against implementations of ODF and the XML Reference Schema (again, of course, respectively). In an ideal open standards/open source world, of course, all IPR would be public domain, but we''re a long way from being there yet\r\n<p>As a result, the question then becomes (at least from this pragmatic perspective), "Do we have a problem here or not?"\r\n<p>According to the article, there is a problem, which is summarized as follows: <blockquote>\r\nSuarez-Potts said that OpenOffice is currently suffering from the corporate politics between Sun and IBM, which is causing IBM to refrain from contributing to the project. An IBM contribution could further speed up development and provide OpenOffice with additional features that increase the software''s appealâ€¦.\r\n<p>OpenOffice.org would be interested in several of the adjustments that IBM has made to the application [for use in its own software that supports ODF], according to Suarez-Potts.\r\n<p>Big Blue has tackled some long standing issues by increasing performance, reducing the size of the code base and increasing its ease of use for corporate users. "The code that IBM has created seems pretty cool," said Suarez-Potts. </blockquote>\r\n<p>The implication is that IBM is holding back because of Sun''s ownership of the code, and the article goes on to recount an email exchange with Bob Sutor as follows: <blockquote>\r\nSutor... told vnunet.com in an email that the company is open to discussing the OpenOffice situation.  "If OpenOffice did become independent we would be interested in talking to Sun about it, but it''s not holding us back in any way," he wrote.\r\n<p>Sutor added that IBM supports the Open Document Format (ODF) in several of its products. OpenOffice uses the same format, which ensures that an ODF document can be opened and edited in any ODF-supporting application.</blockquote>\r\nThe article states that Sun had not responded to requests for comment, but also that:  <blockquote>\r\nSuarez-Potts stressed that he is not currently pushing Sun to relinquish control, and that he would pursue the matter only if it has a clear advantage such as code contributions from IBM.  "If IBM expresses strong interest in the idea, and we can maintain the costs, then we should pursue it," he said. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I found this rather unsatisfying.  Suarez-Potts says that he''d like a foundation to own the code, but, hey, it''s really OK as it is, but, of course, if <i>IBM</i> were to push for it, then maybe this is something that should happen here.  \r\n\r\n<p>It all sounded like a rather incomplete effort to cobble together assorted bits of information to make a story, so I first got in touch with IBM Vice President of standards and Open Source Bob Sutor to find out what, if anything, he had meant to imply with his email.  Here''s his response:<blockquote>\r\nThe VNUnet reporter sent me an email "out of the blue" asking for my\r\nopinion. With a metaphorical "shrug of my shoulders" I responded as I did.  To be more clear, and on the record, IBM and Sun are working together happily and effectively on the OpenDocument Format. I think we''ve made a terrific amount of progress in the last year and that''s because of the broad cooperation by the community. I''m not sure why we were dragged into the referenced story, but it was certainly nothing we initiated. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo that was interesting. Next I contacted Simon Phipps, Sun''s Chief Open Source Officer, and here''s what he had to say: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n* Sun is pleased to be able to support the OpenOffice.org community in many ways, such as by donating the work of a significant number of  developers, by paying for the hosting of the web site and downloads  and by supporting the administrative staffing. </br>\r\n* While the subject of a "Foundation" has been raised, the fact is  \r\nthat Sun has already "let go" of OpenOffice.org by purchasing  \r\nStarDivision in 1999 and releasing the source code to StarOffice as  \r\nFree/open source software under the LGPL, making the source code  \r\navailable to any developer.</br>\r\n* Right now the highest priorities are revamping the procedures and  \r\nsystems used by the OpenOffice.org developers, and that is in progress.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI''ve done some digging around, and what Simon says is right.  It looks like something like 80% of the OpenOffice.org developers work for Sun (and are paid by it), and most of the rest work for Novell.  Presumably, at least 80% of the people actually doing the work for OpenOffice.org aren''t passionate about having a foundation own most of the copyrights in the code which is, after all, open source anyway.\r\n\r\n<p>So the long and short of it is that it doesn''t look like there''s much "there" there in this article.  After all, neither IBM nor Sun is looking for their respective ODF implementations to be significant revenue generators (and they aren''t - I wonder whether StarOffice revenues would even cover Sun''s costs of supporting OpenOffice.org).  Instead, it''s central to their strategy to have <i>many</i> applications that support ODF.  Remember - it''s  a good thing, and not a bad thing, for there to be many different implementations â€“ both proprietary and open source â€“ so long as they all support ODF.  That''s one of the big reasons why ODF matters â€“ to have multiple choices (and not just one â€“ Office), each with its own independently valuable features.\r\n\r\n<p>It''s also fair to remember that when Linus Torvalds set out to write Linux, that''s what he did â€“ he set out to write it, not to ask that the then-owner of Unix donate it to him.  In this case,  OpenOffice.org is a lot better off than Linus was, even if it doesn''t have 100% ownership of the code â€“ and it is also a lot farther along than Linus was by the same point in time.\r\n\r\n<p>All of which isn''t to say that if I was heavily involved in the OpenOffice.org project that, given my druthers, I wouldn''t prefer to have the code in a foundation as well.  But I think for now that''s a noise level issue.  There are a lot of big issues that need to be  addressed right rather than looking for little issues to make big.\r\n\r\n<p><i><b>Epilogue:</b></i> Not long after posting this, I received the following email from none other than Louis Suarez-Potts, who kindly gave me permission to blog on it: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nTom Sanders'' headline, <a href=''http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2149926/sun-urged-give- \r\nopenoffice?page=2''>"Sun urged to give up OpenOffice control"</a> (8  \r\nFeb. 2006; ) is wrong.  At no point have I urged in my or  \r\nOpenOffice.org''s behalf for Sun to give up control of OpenOffice.org.  \r\n(Even assuming it *has* control: I have long argued it doesn''t. It  \r\nsimply holds copyright to the source and has the most developers  \r\nworking on it.)\r\n\r\n<p>I have to agree with you about the lack of a "there," there.  My  \r\npoint in the interview was that OpenOffice.org would be happy to  \r\naccept IBM''s work on OpenOffice.org; from what I have learned, this  \r\nwork is independent of the OpenDocument Format, which Sun and IBM are  \r\nindeed collaborating on.

Last week, it hit a bump in the road.', 'Those who have been following the OpenDocument Format (ODF) story will recall that in late November Microsoft announced that it would <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1760''>offer its XML Reference Schema </a> (XML RS) to Ecma, a European standards body, as an alternative to ODF.  Microsoft''s desire was that Ecma would speedily approve the offer (under very <a href=''\r\nhttp://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1795''>restrictive terms</a>) and then refer the resulting XML RS specification to ISO, the global standards body, for approval as a global standard (ODF is already in the adoption voting process at ISO).\r\n\r\n<p>If you have been following the process closely, you will probably also know that Microsoft offered another specification, C++/Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to  Ecma in 2003.  In consequence, those interested in the ODF story have been watching the progress (and process) of the C++/CLI submission with interest for indications of how Microsoft and Ecma will handle the XML RS submission.\r\n\r\n<p>To date, most stories that I have read have speculated on what effect offering C++/CLI to a submitter-friendly body like Ecma (which has a reputation for pushing submissions through its process quickly and with fewer changes requested by other members than many other standards organizations would permit) has had on implementation of the specification in the marketplace.  In general, those that I recall seeing have suggested that the market uptake of the Microsoft specification has been slow to date, and that the process and choice of Ecma by Microsoft may be a reason why this might be so.\r\n\r\n<p>Ecma recently adopted C++/CLI, and, as requested by Microsoft, duly submitted the specification to ISO for "fast track" adoption, which was expected to follow without incident.\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, however, there was a hitch in the process, involving, of all things, the name chosen for the C++/CLI draft standard.  As reported by Matt Mondok at <a href=''http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2006/2/3/2760''>ArsTechnica</a>, \r\non February 3, the U.K. representatives to ISO have submitted an objection that the similarity (at the name level) but differences (at the technical level) to the already existing C++ language standard will result in confusion.  As quoted in the ArsTechnica piece: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nCurrently Microsoft is the only current vendor of a C++/CLI compiler, and also a leading vendor of a Standard C++ compiler. And yet Microsoftâ€™s online documentation consistently confuses the syntax and semantics of C++/CLI with those of Standard C++. \r\n\r\n<p>Documentation for Microsoft''s Visual C++ product contains many code examples identified as "C++" -- not "C++/CLI" or even "C++.Net" -- which will fail to compile in a Standard C++ environment. See, for example, http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/NetFramework.asp, which has many examples showing parallel code for "C#", "Visual Basic", and "C++" (without the â€œ/CLIâ€ qualifier). </blockquote>\r\n\r\nTo date, I haven''t written on this, as it has not been clear to me that there is anything going here beyond a name dispute.  But several others with greater technical expertise than I can bring to the underlying technical issues have.\r\n\r\n<p>As so often happens, the first to take notice of the development was Pamela Jones, at Groklaw, who first wrote on the topic several days before Mondok, on <a href=''http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060130092823950''>January 30</a>.  Pamela reproduced excerpts from the UK objections paper, and raised the question of whether the Ecma specification would open the door to the addition of proprietary extensions in actual products that could give a dominant vendor (such as Microsoft) a competitive advantage in the marketplace, once the specification became an adopted standard.\r\n\r\n<p>Since then Elizabeth Montalbano, at IDG News Services has <a href=''http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/02/02/75047_HNcpluscli_1.html''>picked up the story</a>, as has <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=2563''>David Berlind</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>Is there a real story here?  Microsoft has already said that they will support a change to the name of the standard, so if there ever was a name game going on at all, it appears that this game is over.  So that story appears to have been a little one, and over besides.  \r\n\r\n<p>There are, however, two things worth examining here that relate to bigger issues.  The first is what the end-to-end process of the specification to date has been, and what effect that process will have on the uptake of C++/CLI (or whatever the final ISO standard will be called).  How fixed or flexible was the submission, and did the submission have any "designed in" unfair advantages for Microsoft, as suggested by Pamela Jones?  And to what extent, if any, has the process impacted the uptake of XML RS in the marketplace?  These go beyond naming issues, and will effect the marketplace for as long as the standard is implemented.\r\n\r\n <p>The second is, what does this process bode for XML RS?  Presumably, the C++/CLI experience will be a reasonable predictor of the XML RS experience to come, and therefore the continuing advancement of XML RS through final ISO adoption â€“ as well as what happens in the marketplace after that adoption occurs - will be interesting and instructive to watch.\r\n\r\n<p><center>* * * * * * *</center>\r\n\r\n<p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <center><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

The version posted at the OpenDocument Fellowship site is one I''ve heard twice before, the first time at Armonk on November 1, when Peter expected to be doing something very different than he is today.\r\n\r\n<p>What Peter is doing today, among other things, is going on the stump to preach the gospel of open systems, and the presentation posted is the one he gave Friday at SCALE 4X, the Southern California Linux Expo.  Peter will be sharing his thoughts in other venues as well, including, not surprisingly, as the Keynote speaker at <a href=''http://www.oasis-open.org/events/symposium_2006/''>OASIS Symposium 2006</a>, which will be held in San Francisco on May 9 â€“ 12.\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation now available on line is somewhat poignant, in that most of the first 50 slides (out of 60) were all created back when Peter was flying high as the Massachusetts CIO, leading the charge of his Information Technology Division (ITD) into a brave new world of open systems based on open standards and open source.  They describe the state of the Massachusetts IT infrastructure (or lack thereof) when Peter took over in 2003, and the "perfect storm" he encountered â€“ a tight budget with worse expected to come, a new IT commission, and a new administration â€“ and how he viewed it as an opportunity rather than a hurdle.  In his words,   "We had an opportunity that only comes around every 15 or 20 years to truly transform IT."\r\n\r\n<p>The effort gets off to a bit of an uphill start, as a multi-state initiative to create shared software and standards that commenced with monthly meetings among CIOs bogs down.  But at the same time, then Secretary of Finance and Administration Eric Kriss and Quinn are moving full speed ahead to develop an "Open Standards/Open  Source Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM)," which they release in first-draft form in 1.5 months.\r\n\r\n<p>That first version of the ETRM draws fire from many sectors, including the Massachusetts Software Council, the legislature, and some advocacy groups â€“ but it also attracts applause from other organizations and open source advocates around the world.  Eventually, the open source elements and the open standards requirements are separated, with the former being desirable when appropriate, and the latter mandatory in all situations.\r\n\r\n<p>The story continues through  committee hearings, open meetings, new drafts of the ETRM, and to the eventual adoption of the policy last September â€“ without approval of the Microsoft XML Reference Schema but including endorsement of ODF and Adobe PDF.  After the ETRM is adopted there is a rapid escalation of opposition that culminates in Peter''s resignation as CIO on Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\n<p>The slides also describe in detail the IT environment that the ETRM was creating, as well as the real functionality needs (and, as importantly, the functionalities deemed to be superfluous) of the Executive Agencies, as determiend by the ITD, including Peter''s conclusion that the office suite as we know it today is outmoded, loaded with many features that few actually need, overly expensive - and therefore unnecessary.\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation includes quite a few new slides as well, which begin to appear with increasing frequency among the older material as the time frame moves forward.  Some of these slides detail the personal attacks and the political opposition that begin to build.  One slide (number 40), for example, reads as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>Boston Globe Investigation cont: <blockquote>\r\n<p>- Numerous requests for Ombudsman to  investigate by outside people (to no avail)\r\n<p>- Everyone saw it for what it was: a blatant  attempt to discredit the format initiative </blockquote>\r\nUnderstand that some folks will stop at  nothing to destroy â€œOpen Formatâ€ as they  tried with Open Source </blockquote></b>\r\n\r\nAnd another (number 42) that that reads like this: <blockquote><b>\r\nTwo favorite headlines: <blockquote>\r\nBoston Globe: <blockquote>\r\nMicrosoft Bows to Massachusetts (MS has gone to  ECMA for approval of XML Schema) </blockquote>\r\nLondon Inquirer: <blockquote>\r\nOpen Doc Man: â€œCleared of Smearâ€ </blockquote></b></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAfter slide number 44, most of the slides relate to matters and thoughts that postdate Peter''s resignation.  Number 45 is headed "Continued Personal Initiative," and reads as follows: <blockquote><b>\r\n\r\n-  Make accessibility as an issue disappear\r\n<p>-  Presumed on Industry to â€œCommit and act  on Open Standardsâ€ and leave the  religious Open Source debate at the door\r\n<p>-  Coalesce as I, we, know you can and  create serious agreed upon actions and  execute\r\n<p>-  Important to the community to lower the price point; if solutions are Open Sourced, the community can do its own work\r\n<p>-  And everyone in this room will need it  </blockquote></b>\r\n\r\nIf anything, Peter seems more committed to open source now than before.  Slide 47, for example, reads like this: <blockquote><b>\r\n\r\n-  â€œOpen Sourceâ€ is one avenue of a multi- faceted pincer strategy to create  meaningful sustainability of IT with a very  different cost structure in government. \r\n<p>-  â€œThe cost of Government is not sustainable  in its present form.â€ </blockquote></b>\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral slides beginning at number 52 are titled "Some Opposition Comments and My Final Thoughts."  Each includes a contention of the anti-ODF camp, followed by a "Retort" representing Peter''s counterargument.  Respectively, they refute the contentions that the ITD was trying to be a "regulator;" that IT policy should be the sole province of the legislature; and that Massachusetts was following an "ABM" (Anything But Microsoft) agenda.  This section ends as follows: <blockquote><b>\r\n\r\n-  We would say the following to put this  issue in context: <blockquote>\r\n-  Ma was the first state with a public school\r\n<p>- Ma was the first state with a public library <blockquote>\r\n-  Both are about access to information </blockquote>\r\n-  Ma is the first state to establish standards for  open formats insuring information access for  future generations </blockquote>\r\nIs this initiative any less compelling? </blockquote></blockquote></b>\r\n\r\nOverall, it''s quite a saga, and needless to say, it''s not over yet.  And, of course, even when it''s over in Massachusetts, it won''t be all over, because Massachusetts is only one state, and many other governments and agencies â€“ local, state and national - are upgrading their IT infrastructures and relying more heavily on open standards (always) and open source (increasinglyl), and making their own evaluations of ODF as well.  \r\n\r\n<p>In consequence, what Eric Kriss and Peter Quinn started in Massachusetts is only a beginning, and not an end.  Peter Quinn, may be out, but he''s not down.\r\n\r\n<p>I can''t help closing with the same slide Peter used as his final word in his presentations during happier times (it''s now slide 50).  It reads like this: <blockquote><b>\r\n\r\n-  There are risks and costs to a program of action. But they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.  John F. Kennedy<i>\r\nUS Democratic politician (1917 - 1963) </i>\r\n\r\n<p>-  Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn''t do than by the ones you did do.

What''s happened since then?  As the reporters say, "Repeated requests for comment have remained unanswered"', '<p><i><blockquote>"Repeated requests for comment from the </i>Globe''s <i>ombudsman regarding the Quinn story have remained unanswered"</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<p>Employing an ombudsman is one of the hallmarks of a newspaper that is committed to maintaining the highest standards of journalism and only a few dozen American papers do so.  The concept is simple:  First, hire a professional whose sole responsibility is to monitor the accuracy and impartiality of the paper''s journalism.  Second, place the ombudsman beyond the reach of the commercial as well as the editorial side of the business, so that he or she need not fear the consequences of exposing conduct that may embarrass the paper, or worse.  And finally, tell readers (and the subjects of stories) how they may get in touch with the ombudsman if they think that the paper has fallen short of its espoused standards.\r\n\r\n<p>Or, at least, that''s how it''s supposed to work.  When it doesn''t turn out this way, the ombudsman is at risk of becoming part of the story, rather than the guarantor of the integrity of the news reporting process.\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, I''m beginning to fear that this is what has happened in the case of the Boston <i>Globe''s</i> ombudsman, Richard Chacon.  Although he agreed on December 12, 2005 to investigate a local story that has attracted global attention, he has since failed to return many calls and emails from a variety of readers asking when (or perhaps I should more appropriately say "whether") he will report the results of his investigation.    \r\n\r\n<p>The story in which Mr. Chacon is becoming embroiled revolves around the question of how <i>Globe</i> reporter Steve Kurkjian came to write a <a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/26/romney_administration_reviewing_trips_made_by_technology_chief/''>story</a>  that contributed to the <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1863''>resignation</a> of Massachusetts State CIO Peter Quinn not long thereafter.  In the story, Mr. Kurkjian questioned whether Quinn''s travel to technology conferences had been properly documented.  He also reported that his calls to State personnel on this topic sparked an investigation into that travel.  \r\n\r\n<p>The story ran on November 26, 2005, on the front page of the <i>Globe</i> and was in due course picked up by the national press.  But it took state investigators only a matter of days to clear Peter Quinn, by simply calling and confirming that (as he earlier told Mr. Kurkjian) his travel had been duly authorized by his immediate superior, then Secretary of Finance and Administration Eric Kriss. \r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Kurkjian duly wrote a <a href='' http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/12/10/review_backs_trips_by_technology_chief/''>short piece</a> on December 10, reporting that the CIO had been cleared, and also referring back to his original story â€“ but this time the story ran on an inside page.\r\n\r\n<p>Had Mr. Kurkjian delayed publishing his original story (which aired on the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend) until he was able to reach Eric Kriss himself, he could easily have learned â€“ as did the investigators â€“ that there was no story to report.  Or, stated another way, if he had assumed that Peter Quinn was telling the truth rather than the opposite, he would have wished to speak to Mr. Kriss before airing the unsubstantiated allegations on the front page of his newspaper.\r\n\r\n<p>There are many people that believe (as do I) that it is highly unlikely that Mr. Kurkjian woke up one morning possessed of an irresistible desire to investigate Peter Quinn''s travel documentation.  It is much more logical to assume that Mr. Kurkjian received a false tip, given the heated debates and lobbying that were ongoing at the time relating to Mr. Quinn''s controversial effort to implement a new technology policy.  That policy requires the Executive Agencies of Massachusetts on and after January 1, 2007 to only save documents using office productivity software that meets the "openness" standards established in that policy.\r\n\r\n<p>Thus far, the Information Technology Division (ITD) that Quinn led has determined that office suites that support only two standards meet this test: Adobe PDF and OpenDocument Format (ODF), a standard developed by OASIS, a global consortium with headquarters in the Boston area.  Microsoft Office does not support ODF, and has announced that it has no current plans to do so.  It has also strongly contended that the ITD''s decision not to endorse a specification of its own design â€“ XML Reference Schema - is unjustified, and has since offered that specification to a European standards organization for adoption.\r\n \r\n<p>At the same time, there has been a <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1745''>nasty little turf battle</a> playing out on Beacon Hill (where the Massachusetts Statehouse stands), in which one part of the State government is attempting to take control of information and communication technology policy away from the ITD, and place it under a new politically appointed "Task Force."  That transfer of power would occur under an amendment (the "Morrissey Amendment") tacked on to an existing economic stimulus bill that is nearing adoption.  \r\n\r\n<p>In his resignation email to his employees and a later interview posted at <a href=''http://www.groklaw.net''>Groklaw.net</a>, Mr. Quinn stated that his ability to function in his role as State CIO had been made impossible, due to the public smears (such as those relating to the travel investigation) and political attacks (including efforts to deny funding to the ITD) that were ongoing.  As a result, his email to his employees reads: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt is also readily apparent that I have become a lightning rod \r\nWith regard to any IT initiative. Even the smallest initiatives are \r\nBeing mitigated or stopped by some of the most unlikely and often \r\nUniformed parties. I view these circumstances quite troubling because \r\nthe good work laid out by the IT Commission is slowly being strangled and brought to a halt. And the last thing I can let happen is my presence be the major contributing factor in marginalizing the good work of ITD and the entire IT Community. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, it had been no secret since the late summer of 2005 that Peter Quinn had many enemies, and certainly this was apparent by the time that the original <i>Globe</i> piece appeared.  Lobbyists on both sides of the issue had been <a href='' http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1976''>calling heavily</a> on Massachusetts legislator and administrators for months, disinformation had been widely disseminated, as evidenced by public comments sent to the ITD and posted at its Website, and the stakes â€“ both political and commercial - were clearly high, with Office representing something like 40% of Microsoft''s profits.  Any tip that a reporter might receive â€“ especially if it came from a source with a stake in the outcome of the dispute, whether a legislative aide, a lobbyist, or perhaps, say, someone working for a PR firm hired by a lobbyist hired by a party with a stake in the outcome â€“ would have a high risk of being at best inflated, and at worst totally baseless.\r\n\r\n<p>But if, as seems likely, Mr. Kurkjian received a tip, who made the call?  And what motivated the tip?  Finally, was Mr. Kurkjian set up by someone who expected his inquiries to trigger an investigation, thereby perhaps making Mr. Kurkjian feel that he had to take the story to print?\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever happened behind the scenes, what played out on the pages of the <i>Globe</i> left many people â€“ including myself - questioning whether Mr. Kurkjian and his editor had acted responsibly in reporting the original story. Accordingly, on the same day that Peter Quinn was cleared, I both called and emailed the <i>Globe''s</i> ombudsman, Richard Chacon on December 10, suggesting that he look into the situation.  A copy of my full email appears <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1805''>here</a>.  Included in that email was a request to look into the following specific questions:	<blockquote>\r\n\r\n1.  Did Mr. Kurkjian decide to look into Mr. Quinn''s travel on his own, or was this suggested to him by someone?\r\n\r\n<p>2.  If there was a source, who was that source?\r\n\r\n<p>3.  If there was a source, was that source inside the Massachusetts government or outside?\r\n\r\n<p>4.  If the source was inside the government, were the disclosures made to Mr. Kurkjian made in violation of any State policy?\r\n\r\n<p>5.  If the source was outside the government, did the source have any affiliations that would lead him or her to have an interest in the disparagement of Mr. Quinn?\r\n\r\n<p>6.  Why did Mr. Kurkjian not wait to run the story until he was able to reach Mr. Kriss, who Mr. Kurkjian knew could confirm or disprove the basis for the story?\r\n\r\n<p>7.  Was this story, and the investigation behind it, in compliance with the Globe''s policies? </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I was pleased to receive a reply from Mr. Chacon on December 12, which reads in full as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nMr. Updegrove,\r\n\r\n<p>Greetings and many thanks for your detailed note. I think you raise some reasonable questions about the Globe''s stories concerning Peter Quinn (I had many of the same ones when I read Saturday''s story that he was cleared in the investigation).\r\n\r\n<p>I don''t have immediate answers for you (or your blog readers, many of whom have sent their own similar notes after having read your page). I can tell you at the outset that Stephen Kurkjian is one of the most experienced, professional and ethical journalists that I have ever known. Nevertheless, I do believe that some of these questions deserve answers - from Steve and his editors.\r\n\r\n<p>I have already sent a note to Steve asking for a chance to talk about the stories. I will offer a more detailed reply when I have some answers.\r\n\r\n<p>Regards,\r\n<br>Richard Chacon</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI included this response in the blog entry noted above, so that others would know that the <i>Globe</i> was living up to its promise to be responsible to its readers.\r\n\r\n<p>Time passed.  Peter Quinn announced his resignation on <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=1863''>December  24 </a>, and Mr. Kurkjian wrote another <a href=''http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/12/28/technology_adviser_quits_unexpectedly/''>short piece</a> several days later (on December 28), duly noting that the investigation into Quinn''s travel documentation had played a significant role in his decision â€“ but not mentioning that his own story had sparked that investigation.  Nor did the story make the front page. \r\n\r\n<p>During this same time period (and while the Morrissey amendment was still pending on Beacon Hill), Microsoft purchased an "Advertorial" on the editorial pages of the <i>Globe</i> (the same ad ran in other local media as well, such as the <i>Boston Business Journal</i>) touting the advantages to Massachusetts of the "developer ecosystem" that it helped support in the Bay State, although it has few employees in-state. (ODF supporters IBM and Sun Microsystems were concurrently sending Governor Romney letters noting the thousands of high-paying jobs that they each maintained in Massachusetts.)\r\n\r\n<p>More time passed.  On December 27 I sent Mr. Chacon an email informing him that Peter Quinn had announced his resignation, and asking him "Can we expect your report on the situation soon?"  But I received no response.\r\n\r\n<p>Still more time passed, and I began to receive email questions and complaints from readers of my blog, asking when the ombudsman''s report would issue.\r\n\r\n<p>On February 9, I called Mr. Chacon''s office and spoke to his assistant.  I left a detailed message, explaining the situation and asking that Mr. Chacon respond to me by email or telephone with an update on when we might hear more.  I also sent him the following email the same day: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nMr. Chacon,\r\n\r\n<p>As you may recall, you and I corresponded back in December relating to Steve Kurkjian''s article about Peter Quinn; I''ve appended my original email and your response for your reference.\r\n\r\n<p>Following up on a message that I just left with your assistant, I am hoping that you will reply with a date by which you expect to be able to present your conclusions regarding the Kurkjian story.  My reason for getting in touch at this point in time is that I am receiving more and more email, and seeing more posts on the Web, that read like this: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n"I''m getting increasingly frustrated with the globe ombudsman as I still have not heard back from him - have you andy?" </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI know that you have been getting calls and emails from others on this topic, and doubt that those that are upset about the story are likely to let it sit.  If you can give me an idea when you may be ready to offer something to the public, I can post that at my blog and set expectations broadly, as my site gets c: 200,000 visits a month, more than half of whom are following the ODF story through my blog.  If people know that something will be coming, and approximately when, I expect that it will preserve some goodwill that is already in short supplyâ€¦.\r\n\r\n<p>I hope to hear back from you, as well as look forward to hearing your eventual report.\r\n\r\n<p>Best regards,\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Updegrove </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<i>[I have deleted one paragraph above, which contains what I have been told by someone I believe to be a knowledgeable source was the source of the tip.]</i>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, I have (once again) received no reply.\r\n\r\n<p>It is now two and a half months since the original story by Mr. Kurkjian appeared in the <i>Globe</i>, and it is more than two months since Mr. Chacon indicated that he would look into the situation.  Since that time, the <i>Globe</i>, through Steve Kurkjian and Hiawatha Bray (a technology reporter), has continued to publish articles on the ongoing ODF story â€“ as well as paid Microsoft advertising on its Editorial page which is widely regarded as being intended to influence the legislature and the administration with respect to the Morrissey Amendment and the ODF policy.\r\n\r\n<p>So - how long is a reasonable amount of time to wait for the results of an investigation that may involve little more than two conversations - one with Steve Kurkjian and one with his editor?  Given the fact that the story continues to be one of importance, I cannot help but think that a response is long overdue.\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly the ombudsman of a daily paper must be besieged with calls and email.  I''m sure that while the great majority relate to trivial matters, there will be some that warrant investigation.  But when the ombudsman himself is struck by a story, and indicates that he will follow up on it, then that promise becomes a part of the story itself.  After all:  how often have you read the sentence, "Mr. X failed to respond to repeated telephone calls requesting comment."  Reflecting that state of affairs here is as relevant as it would be in any other story reported by a <i>Globe</i> reporter.\r\n\r\n<p>Why has there been no reply to date?  Truly, I have no idea.  The very concept of an ombudsman is to maintain credibility, and Mr. Chacon''s commitment to report back on this story is publicly known.  The longer he delays while the <i>Globe</i> prints Microsoft ads, the more that credibility is damaged â€“ regardless of what the final report may say (assuming a report does eventually issue), because events will have occurred in the meantime that may have been influenced by what is disclosed.  Either those that may have acted improperly will have enjoyed an advantage in their continuing efforts to affect the outcome of the ODF policy and the Morrissey Amendment, or those that have been suspected of such conduct and are in fact innocent will have been wrongly suspected and maligned.  There is no neutral ground in the court of public opinion.\r\n\r\n<p>Massachusetts is being watched by people around the world with respect to its leadership role in implementing ODF â€“ and its petty squabbling over the same action has been equally noted.  State CIOs have been intimidated by what befell Peter Quinn, and want to know why, and whether the same thing could happen to them.  Whether there was a tip, and if so, who made that tip will tell much about whether those fears are justified, and whether other CIOs have something to fear as well.\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, only Steve Kurkjian knows the answer to that question.  I don''t know that we can expect him to reveal his source to us, but I do know that Mr. Chacon can tell us whether he believes that Steve Kurkjian acted responsibly, and whether he concludes that Mr. Kurkjian was used to one side''s advantage, the other side''s harm, and to Peter Quinn''s defenestration.\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Chacon, people around the world are waiting to here what you have to say.  There is a way to remove yourself from the story, and that is to respond.  \r\n\r\n<p>I, and many others, impatiently await your reply.\r\n\r\n<p><i>Richard Chacon can be reached (or not, as the case may be) at the following email addresses: chacon@globe.com, ombud@globe.com and by number at(617)929-3020; he also has a separate voicemail number: (617)939-3022. </i>\r\n\r\n<center><p>* * * * * * * * *</center>\r\n\r\n<center><p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Last night I got a response.', 'Yesterday, I posted a <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=2044''>long review</a> of the history of the Boston <i>Globe''s</i> reporting of former Massachusetts State CIO Peter Quinn''s travel to conferences, the investigation that followed, and Quinn''s eventual resignation.  The specific purpose of the blog entry was to note that the <i>Globe''s</i> ombudsman, Richard Chacon, had promised on December 12, 2005 to review the situation, but had not responded since then to numerous inquiries from me and others regarding what he might have discovered, and when he would report on his investigation.                        \r\n\r\n<p>After posting the blog entry, I sent the link to Mr. Chacon and left voicemail at his office number as a courtesy. My brief email ended with the statement, "I still hope to hear the results of your inquiry, but have been disappointed how things turned out after such a good start." \r\n\r\n<p>I''m pleased to report that I received a response from Mr. Chacon last night.  Given that I have been acting as the proxy for many who have called and emailed the ombudsman''s office, here is Mr. Chacon''s email in full: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAndrew,\r\n\r\n<p>Greetings and thanks for your note and heads-up on the blog entry. I''ll\r\ntake a look when I have a moment. I''m sorry you feel disappointed with the\r\nstatus of my inquiry. You should know that the ombudsman''s office fields\r\nhundreds of very varied comments, questions and requests for explanations\r\nor investigations every week. We (my part-time assistant and I) try our\r\nbest to respond to as many queries as possible. Some requests are easier or\r\nquicker to resolve than others.\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the reason for the delay has been my inability to contact Peter\r\nQuinn so that I could hear his version of the story. I have spoken with\r\nSteve Kurkjian and so far have been convinced that the initial\r\ninvestigation into the story was for sound reasons - that Quinn had not\r\nfollowed proper state procedures for documenting his business travel.\r\nAlthough I do have some lingering questions over why the first story was\r\nallowed to run without comment from Eric Kriss, which might have provided a\r\ndifferent tone to the initial article, I don''t doubt the initial reasons for\r\nlooking into the story. I''ve been told by Steve that more stories on a\r\nrelated topic are coming, though I don''t know specifically what those\r\nstories are and wouldn''t ask him.\r\n\r\n<p>I (and the Globe) have no stake in the debate over Open Source or Windows.\r\nYou and many of your blog readers clearly do and I understand that. I would\r\ninvite Steve, whom I''ve cc''d on this reply to offer his own thoughts on the\r\nmatter for you and your readers.\r\n\r\n<p>I will continue to try to contact Quinn. If I make progress on this, I\r\nwould be happy to let you know. I won''t promise a time frame because, as\r\nI''ve learned repeatedly in this job, there are lots of balls to juggle\r\nevery week.\r\n\r\n<p>Regards,\r\n<br>Richard Chacon </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI sent Messrs. Chacon and Kurkjian a lengthy email in response, which reads in part as follows: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nThanks for the response, which is appreciated.  I will post it at my blog tomorrow.  I know that there are many people who are looking forward to your report.  I would also be more than happy to include anything that Steve Kurkjian might like me to include as well.\r\n\r\n<p>I do wish to clarify one point that you address in your email:  I don''t question that Steve was following up on what he thought was a valid story.  What I do question is who gave the tip (if I am right in assuming that this is the case), what that person hoped to accomplish, and whether Steve should have been more cautious given the possibility of ulterior motives.  Finally, if it seems that Steve was the victim of a set up, then that is important news that the public is entitled to know - including how it was done, and by whom.  I''m not finding fault here, as certainly the same thing will happen to me some day.  But I am interested in the facts being made known of exactly what happened.\r\n\r\n<p>I am sure that you get many, many complaints, some of which must be laughable and some serious, and that a significant number must require some amount of your time.  I hope that you can appreciate the frustration that I and many others have felt in this instance.  I do expect that the volume of calls and email that you have received on this story has been unusual, which I would have hoped might have escalated it somewhat in your schedule.  One reason that I both called and spoke to your assistant last week, and also sent an email, was to offer you the ability to let those that are following this story know that you were not ignoring them.  I can tell you that there has been much spleen vented over the fact that the Globe has not yet publicly addressed this issue, both locally, nationally and internationally.  In other words (at least in my view), it''s an issue of importance, both to Peter Quinn and others that are involved as well as to the Globe and its reputation.  Again, my interest here is not in making the Globe look bad, but in getting to the bottom of the story - we have much in common.  I should also say that I don''t have anything personal at stake in this story either, other than a belief that ODF matters.  I''ve worked with hundreds of standards in my career, very few of which mattered to anyone other than engineers.  ODF, on the other hand, matters to all of us.\r\n\r\n<p>Had I known that you were trying to contact Peter Quinn, I could also have been helpful in that regard.  I am copying him on this email, and you can see his new email address above and arrange a time to speak.\r\n\r\n<p>Steve, to be clear, I do not think that you intended to do anything inappropriate in following up on what (I assume) was a tip.  I am aware of your good reputation.  I do suspect, however, that you were set up, and put in a position where your inquiry was used as an excuse to launch an investigation, perhaps leaving you in a position where you felt you needed to go to press.... [This] has also cast a pall over all state CIOs.  As an example:  at a recent briefing on the new GPL open source license, every state employee but one cancelled out - because none of them wanted to be seen at a meeting that involved open source.\r\n\r\n<p>This is a very high stakes game that is being played, involving 40% of Microsoft''s profit.  IBM and Sun are betting heavily on the outcome as well.  It is also a chance for Massachusetts to shine, or to be seen as a petty backwater, and thus far the events on Beacon Hill have relegated us to the latter.  I would have loved to have seen the <i>Globe</i> play a leading role in covering this story for what it is - an important story of innovation that is being watched from all over the world.  Instead, it has received little attention from the <i>Globe</i>, and much of that counterproductive.  This could have been an opportunity for insightful, award winning reporting rather than scant attention and a story that backfired.\r\n\r\n<p>I am happy to hear that you are planning to do more stories, and I would be more than happy to spend as much time with you as you might wish, to fill you in on as much detail as you might want on standards and open source, to point you to all of the resources that are available, and to introduce you to any of the players involved...\r\n\r\n<p>No one would be happier than me if the <i>Globe</i> should decide to give serious attention to this story (as I have).  I hope that you will dive into it, and that you will feel free to contact me if I can be of assistance.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard from Steve this morning, who took me up on my offer, and I''ll be sitting down with him on Friday to provide background on the story from my perspective.  At his request, we will not talk about his sources for the original article, nor will I report on our conversations unless we mutually agree to do so.\r\n\r\n<p>I am glad that the <i>Globe</i> will be following up on this further.  I am one of those that not only believes in a free, vigorous and independent press,  but also in the responsibility that goes along with that privileged position.  Had this been a story involving a politician whose actions gave rise to a perception that something might not be wholly proper, the press would expect answers to its questions, and would let the public decide whether it thought that the actions were appropriate after all of the facts became public.\r\n\r\n<p>In this context, the question isn''t the identity of the specific source, but whether it appears that the <i>Globe</i> allowed itself to be manipulated by that source, and how it acted after that became apparent.  I believe that those that rely on the <i>Globe </i>for news, and those that have been the subject of the <i>Globe''s</i> reporting in the past (such as Peter Quinn), or may in the future (such as you or I), are entitled to know the answers to these questions.\r\n\r\n<p>I look forward to the <i>Globe</i> providing continuing coverage of this story, to the opportunity to provide what I hope will be useful information to provide additional context for that reporting, and to the eventual report of Mr. Chacon on how the original story about Peter Quinn''s travel came to be written, and whether he concludes that the  <i>Globe</i> was taken advantage of to pursue a political agenda.\r\n\r\n<center><p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Gavin Clark at The Register.com titled his story about the session "Microsoft ignites idea of independent versions of Office" and subtitled it "Rivals Flame Redmond."  That''s a bit overwrought, but it was an interesting session none the less.', 'I''m just back from the Open Source Business Conference that ran in San Francisco this week, where I moderated a session on "Open Standards and Open Source."

A great panel, and representative of the quality of the key note speakers and panelists throughout the conference.  I''ll come back to what was said during our session later in this entry, but as a preview, here''s an account from <a href=''http://www.theregister.com/2006/02/16/office_open_standards/''> The Register.com</a> that''s titled "Microsoft ignites idea of independent versions of Office" and subtitled "Rivals Flame Redmond."  That''s a bit overwrought, but it was an interesting session nonetheless.\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven''t been to an OSBC conference, you might want to give it a try.  The concept is not to be too big (about 700 people signed up, although it looked like not all were there at any one time), but to still get a good mix of people from all backgrounds.  The format (schedule and physical layout) also puts an emphasis on putting people together and getting them talking, and to enable the exchange of lots of good ideas.  Overall, it works pretty well.\r\n\r\n<p>On the plus side, they pulled a good, diverse crowd â€“ ranging from individual open source community participants to venture capitalists, and everyone in between.  The <a href=''http://www.osbc.com/live/13/events/13SFO06A/keynotes''>Key Note speakers</a>  also covered the gamut from big name vendor officers (like Sun President and COO Jonathan Schwartz), to respected theoreticians (e.g., Lawrence Lessig, who always puts on a good show), to historical lions (Lotus Notes founder Mitch Kapor) to CEOs of new open source startups (like SugarCRM founder and CEO John Roberts).\r\n\r\n<p>Another successful aspect was the "common room," right sized with tables, displays and perpetual food and drink, and long breaks throughout the day for people to get together and talk.  Press coverage was also pretty good.  I talked with <a href=''http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;78762784;fp;16;fpid;0''>Elizabeth Montalbano</a> of ComputerWorld and Brian Proffit of <a href=''http://www.linuxtoday.com/''>LinuxToday.com</a>, and saw <a href=''http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/''> ZDNet''s Dan Farber</a> madly taking notes throughout my session.  There were others besides, making for interesting conversations during breaks with those that were reporting on how they were hearing things.\r\n\r\n<p>My major criticism is that the panel sessions are extremely short â€“ only 50 minutes â€“ even though there were three tracks to choose from.  Certainly in the case of my session, it felt like we left much more on the table than we could have.  My choice would be for having two presentations per track in the afternoon instead of three, to allow the panelists and those in attendance to have more of an exchange of ideas. \r\n\r\n<p>It would take far too long to summarize the various sessions and keynotes I attended, but here are some highlights from the session that I moderated.  By way of context, you should know that while the composition of the panel was formulated with the ODF saga as a background, we had decided in advance that we wouldn''t make the session an OpenDocument Format (ODF) vs. XML Reference Schema slugfest (an agreement I think that Tim Bray later regretted).  Regardless, it seems like some in the audience (like The Register''s Gavin Clark) thought that the vendors were mixing it up anyway on at least one or two occasions.   \r\n\r\n<p>What Clark was focusing on in his article was a contention by Jason Matusow that  Microsoft''s submission of the XML Reference Schema to Ecma would lead to other vendors cloning Office (at least at this level of compatibility).  Personally, I haven''t met anyone who seriously thinks that this will happen.  The rest of the panel shared the same opinion, as recorded by Clark: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nPanel member Stephen Walli...challenged the real value of Office XML File Format.  Walli said it was unlikely the standards would produce independent alternatives to Microsoft. "A measure of how successful a standard becomes is how many implementations there are... a standard of one is problematic," Walli said.\r\n\r\n<p>Precedent is certainly on Walli''s side. ECMA ratified Microsoft''s Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and C# programming language several years ago, but since then just one implementation - the open source Project Mono - has emerged.\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Sutor...contrasted this with the fact that "a couple of commercial implementations" already exist that use ODF. ODF is employed in OpenOffice and Sun''s StarOffice, while IBM has plans to use ODF in its Workplace Managed Client 2.6 thin client productivity bundle.\r\n\r\n<p>However, Jason Matusow...shot back calling it "presumptive" to conclude Office XML File Format''s wouldn''t lead to independent implementations. "There will be competing implementations," he said, adding the pace of development would exceed expectations.\r\n\r\n<p>Matusow said the ECMA standards process is designed to promote growth in competition. "This is not a Microsoft dominated piece [of standards work]. Can multiple implementations come from it? The answer is ''yes''." </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, time will tell.  Steve Walli had some further thoughts of his own, which he posted at his blog <a href=''http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2006/02/standards_and_o.html''>the next day</a>: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhen a market begins to mature, there comes a point when the incumbent vendor begins to over deliver functionality to their customers, faster than the customer can absorb it (and therefore the customer doesn''t want to pay for it).  The technology space is mature enough at that point that the best integrated solution is no longer seen as the most valuable solution by the customer, and the technology space can componentize around a set of relevant standards.  \r\n\r\n<p>Customers want such standards, because they feel it will give them better choice.  The incumbent''s competitors are only to happy to define standards to crack open the market away from the incumbent.  This is all pretty much straight out of Christensen''s Innovator''s Solution, with some personal observations based on past experience.  \r\n\r\n<p>This is where open source becomes relevant to the standards process.  Around what do the competitors choose to build a standard?  I would argue they choose a body of technology around which they have already collaborated for a period of time in the industry.  Because the collaboration has been happening, the vendors have existing practise and experience to determine what works or not.  The vendor marketing organizations even likely have certain "customers" they can build case studies around, because of various non-vendor participants in the collaborative spaceâ€¦.\r\n\r\n<p> And we''re seeing this play out around Microsoft Office and the rise of the Open Document Format (ODF) standard.  Microsoft has over delivered to the bulk of their Office customers.  The customers are frustrated.  And Microsoft''s competitors rallied around the OpenOffice project to act as a base from which to define ODF.  The next release of OpenOffice supported ODF.  \r\n\r\n<p>The interesting thing is the dilemma the incumbent faces.  They have to continue to deliver new product releases with new features and functions.  That''s what Wall Street rewards them for doing.  And the incumbent is even brilliantly creating new innovations in the space and could be working feverishly to deliver them.  But the bulk of their customers are over served.  They can''t eat the last round of innovations.  Why would they want to pay for the next round?  Remember, economically, innovation is a supply side activity - customers just want to buy solutions and they don''t want to buy things they don''t use regardless of how innovative they might indeed beâ€¦.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSteve has a lot more to say, so you should read his full post, but I found the above particularly prescient given two other articles in the news today.  The first one <a href='' http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060216-6199.html''>at Ars Technica</a>, has excerpts from an interview with Bill Gates at where he describes the new features that Office 12 will have, and about what the XML Reference Schema are intended to enable: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nOffice 12 has got more sexy new stuff than any new release we''ve done for ages and ages. [...] The thing people will first notice is the new user interface, it lets you get at features in the way that the menu structure was holding you back. [...] The second thing they''ll notice is the role of sharing [...] SharePoint will become on the server what Office is on the client. You can assume people know the templates in your organizational project, you just pick one of those templates and get people collaborating using that.\r\n<p>I think the final thing and what may be the biggest thing is what we''ve done with extensibility. Office extensibility used to mean that you programmed against the user interface of the application. Now, because of the XML revolution, we put it in the core of the product, [...] literally the format of the documents is XML. What that means is that getting the data in and out of these documents and spreadsheets is that you don''t think about the application, you just think about the name range and the scheme. We''ve finally got to the point where people can write solutions in just a few lines of code, moving very complex data in and out of Office applications. That may be the biggest thing, although it''s hundreds of thousands of customization applications, not one single one that''ll show its value .  </blockquote>\r\nAll of which, I think, provides a pretty good illustration of what Steve is talking about.  The second article illustrates the same dilemma from an economic point of view.  The following are excerpts from an article at BetaNews.com called <a href='' http://www.betanews.com/article/Office_2007_Pricing_Packaging_Detailed/1140108452''> Office 2007 Pricing, Packaging Detailed</a>  by Nate Mook: <blockquote>\r\nWith 34 options for customers interested in Office 2007, new server software, and new Client Access Licenses, Jupiter Research senior analyst Joe Wilcox warns that such complexity will make decisions harder for businesses. This issue may be why Microsoft has announced packaging details much earlier than it did for Office 2003.\r\n<p>"My concern is that Microsoft has introduced too much complexity, making more difficult the arduous purchase decision process. Microsoft is right to get information out earlier, because evaluating an Office purchase will be much harder for businesses this release cycle compared to Office 2003 or XP," said Wilcox. </blockquote>\r\nHmmm.  Kind of makes open source sound pretty attractive, don''t you think?\r\n<p>I''ll close with that thought, but you''ll notice that the links at the beginning of this entry that are associated with the names of the panelists will take you to their respective blogs.  I expect that most or all of the panelists will add their thoughts about OSBC and our panel over the next few days (and that Tim Bray will perhaps offer a bit more than he has so far): <blockquote>\r\nThe other [panel I was on], on Open Source and Open Standards, was kind of boring, with Microsoftâ€™s excellent Jason Matusow furiously reframing and recasting, and nobody else getting quite irritated enough to start the polemics, which may have amounted to cheating the audience. Oh, another thing about OSBC: the food is really excellent. </blockquote>\r\n<p>Maybe if we hadn''t been on after an excellent lunch Tim would have felt more feisty.\r\n\r\n<center><p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);

Rambus, Micron, Infineon and Samsung have been singing that one for years, and today Micron Technologies began a new verse, with its latest suit against Rambus.  It all relates to a JEDEC standard setting initiative from the early 1990s, but it has reshaped standard setting.', 'Yet another lawsuit has been filed in the never-ending saga of Rambus and its one-time cohorts in SDRAM standard setting at JEDEC.  This time around, its Micron Technologies that <a href=''http://www.reed-electronics.com/electronicnews/article/CA6309524.html''>has sued Rambus</a>, which only last month had filed yet another <a href=''http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=177100348''>patent infringement suit</a> against Micron.  This <a href=''http://www.micron.com/news/corporate/2000-08-28_16167.html''>isn''t the first time</a> that Micron has sued Rambus, nor was last month''s suit by Rambus against Micron the first time that it had favored the Boise, Idaho chip maker with a complaint.  And there have been others in between.\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, an equal number of suits have been filed by and between Rambus and a number of other chipmakers, as well, including Infineon, Hynix and Samsung.  Not to mention antitrust suits that have been brought against the same chip vendors for alleged price fixing in the same standard setting process.  Samsung, for example, reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice under which it agreed to pay <a href=''http://www.cbronline.com/article_news_print.asp?guid=5209C05A-48D2-4DDC-AC49-2614D93B0E0F''>$300 million</a>, the second largest antitrust fine evey paid.\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, it would require a Groklaw-scale site to do justice to this Dickensian  rat''s nest of litigation, all of which has been spawned by the long ago (1990) work of a single working group inside the JEDEC standards development organization.  I''ve been covering the story for four years now, and if you do a search at this site of <a href=''http://search.blossom.com/query/320?key=rambus''>Rambus</a> you''ll find 84 separate pages that address one aspect or another of the ongoing legal soap opera.\r\n\r\n<p>But back to the present. As reported in <a href=''http://www.reed-electronics.com/electronicnews/article/CA6309524.html''>another story</a> about the same suit, ccording to the story linked above, this time around Micron is alleging that Rambus: <blockquote>\r\nâ€¦has, â€œengaged in a pattern of destruction of evidence, false testimony and other improper activities designed to mislead courts and Micron and to extract unjust patent licensing fees or damages from Micron." \r\n\r\n<p>The compliant, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, includes allegations that Rambus intentionally concealed information through false testimony and other means regarding the ownership of key Rambus patents asserted against Micron in patent suits. It alleges that Rambus violated sections of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and Virginia conspiracy laws through a pattern of illegal conduct. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhile this sounds startling, in fact these are old factual allegations (deception and document destruction) that have been repackaged in new legal charges (in this case, invoking the RICO Act) in order to try a new avenue of attack.  Years ago, a court in the same district found in a case involving another JEDEC defendant (Infineon Technologies) that Rambus had destroyed documents, ruled against Rambus, and awarded millions of dollars of legal fees to Infineon.  \r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately for Infineon, a higher court ruled against it on other grounds, and sent the case back to the trail court judge â€“ who promptly threw the case out again for document destruction.  Rather than fight its way back up through the courts again, Rambus settled with Infineon for what most thought was a disappointing amount for Rambus (it also gave additional license rights to Infineon).\r\n\r\n<p>After settling with Infineon, Rambus turned its full attention against the other defendants, including Micron.  Micron, of course, sought to use the same factual pattern that Infineon had used to defend itself.  And so it goes, on and on.\r\n\r\n<p>The various Rambus cases have been significant in two respects, each of which arise from the fact that something like $5 billion in royalties is at stake.  The first is that those that participate in standards development activities were dismayed when the courts failed to enforce the JEDEC intellectual property rights (IPR) policy and protect them from Rambus'' patent and royalty claims.  All of which has led to a worldwide reexamination and tightening up of IPR policies.  This is what I''ve been writing about for the last four years.\r\n\r\n<p>The second is that Rambus has been a hot stock for years, with its value rocketing and plummeting with each twist of the litigation screw.  As a result, there have been multiple chat sites frequented by day traders and the like.  Those that frequent these sites follow every word said in court and read press reports with the close attention of the ancients that read sheep entrails sheep to divine the future.  \r\n\r\n<p>Let''s just say that those sites, ahem,  "aren''t Groklaw."

But an interview with Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen indicates that Adobe''s control of PDF - and now Flash - may give it a far bigger role from the desktop to mobile devices in the future than ODF may give any other vendor.', 'Adobe PDF has tended to be a footnote in the ODF story to date, principally figuring into the saga by presenting a somewhat troubling question:  did the Massachusetts Information Technology Division (ITD) draw too fine a distinction in saying "no" to the Microsoft XML Reference Schema (especially after Microsoft agreed to make modifications to its license terms) while saying "yes" to Adobe PDF?\r\n\r\n<p>This entry isn''t about reopening that question, however.  Instead, it''s to highlight an extremely interesting, lengthy and detailed interview of Adobe CEO  <a href=''http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/index.cfm?fa=viewArticle&id=1399''>Bruce Chizen</a> at the Managing Technology @ Wharton section of the Wharton Business School Web site.  In the course of that interview, Chizen expresses the belief that neither ODF nor the XML Reference Schema present any threat to Adobe â€“ which he believes is too far too well entrenched to be dislodged.  Instead, he believes that ODF, and Microsoft''s actions in response (including the inclusion of PDF support in Office) will be a boon to Adobe (more on this below).\r\n\r\n<p> The interview comes as Adobe is hard at work integrating Macromedia (which it acquired late last year) into both its operations as well as its strategy.  That acquisition is notable in several ways, with gaining ownership of the Flash format for interactive Web content chief among them, giving Adobe control of a second key de facto standard.  The acquisition also makes Adobe the fifth largest software maker in the world.  \r\n\r\n<p>As the interview notes in its introduction: <blockquote>\r\n\r\nAdobe plans to leverage [PDF and Flash] and other core assets to provide an "engagement platform" that it hopes will provide the foundation for the next generation of software and application development -- both on the web and on users'' desktops. \r\n\r\n<p>Adobe''s vision is grand. CEO Bruce Chizen hopes that Adobe will provide the interface for any device with a screen -- "from a refrigerator to an automobile to a video game to a computer to a mobile phone." Such ambitions put Adobe squarely in the sights of Microsoft, which currently dominates desktop software development. \r\n\r\n<p>And Microsoft is moving quickly to counter Adobe''s moves. It has announced a number of products poised to compete directly with Adobe''s core products. Microsoft''s strategy includes, among other initiatives, positioning elements of the forthcoming Windows Presentation Foundation to compete with Adobe''s Acrobat and Flash applications, and potentially undercutting Adobe''s profitable Acrobat product line by including PDF creation in the next version of Microsoft Office. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, if you haven''t had Adobe on your strategic screen, it''s time you begin to pay attention, if Chizen can indeed deliver on his vision.  Certainly it appears that Microsoft is giving credence to Adobe''s ambitions, which is telling.\r\n\r\n<p>There''s far too much in the interview to summarize here, but let''s take a look at least to the portion that relates to ODF.  Here''s what Wharton asked, and what Chizen answered on that topic: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>Knowledge@Wharton: </b>PDF''s status as a published standard has always been key to your positioning. But, as you know, Microsoft is submitting Office Open XML to [the standards organization] ECMA to get it published as a standard. And Sun and others are supporting [an alternate] Open Document format. Since one of PDF''s big competitors has always been native application file formats, do you see this move toward standardization on the part of these formats as a serious competitor to PDF going forward? \r\n\r\n<p><b>Chizen:</b> I would if PDF hadn''t become the standard it''s become. Because you have so many mission-critical workflows built around PDF -- everything from IRS tax forms to FDA drug regulatory submission documents to U.S. court electronic briefings -- and because Adobe has a 20-year history of not messing with the open specification process, I believe the community at large trusts the approach we have taken. This is demonstrated by their willingness to adopt us as their standard. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI had said above that I wouldn''t go back into whether the line drawn by the ITD was too fine, but I will take a moment to note that one of Chizen''s comments above is particularly interesting on this question: " Adobe has a 20-year history of not messing with the open specification process, I believe the community at large trusts the approach we have taken."  Which is one of the main of the points made by the ITD in justifying its decision.\r\n\r\n<p>I also mentioned above that Chizen thought that PDF support in Office 12 would be a boon to Adobe''s business.  Here''s how that conclusion was developed in the interview: <blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>Knowledge@Wharton: </b>One of the other things Microsoft has announced is the ability to save as PDF in Office 12. This means that, once that happens, non-Adobe technologies are creating PDF in MacOS X, in StarOffice, and on Windows in Office [applications]. Isn''t this a challenge to one of your major revenue streams? \r\n\r\n<b>Chizen: </b> Maybe. But we don''t think so. First of all, it''s somewhat flattering that Microsoft has validated a document format that is not theirs, but one that is Adobe''s -- which suggests that their customers were demanding that it do so.\r\n\r\n<p>We had anticipated for many years that the revenue we achieve around PDF creation would, at some point in time, go away. It''s an open standard! There are many clones out in the marketplace today that create PDF and compete with Acrobat. \r\n\r\n<p>What we have done over the last five years is added functionality beyond PDF creation in our product line-up. If you look at Acrobat today it is much more than just simple PDF creation. In fact, we have a product, called Acrobat Elements, that just does PDF creation, and it represents a relatively tiny piece of our overall revenue -- less than one percent. Most customers choose to buy the more feature-rich products, Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro, which do annotations, digital signatures, web capture [and so on]. And many customers are buying LiveCycle, the server products for mission-critical workflows. That suggests to me that even though PDF creation will become free with products like Microsoft Office, our revenue streams will continue on. \r\n\r\n<p>In fact, with more PDFs being created from Microsoft Office, it gives us an opportunity to take those PDFs and do more with them, like building mission-critical workflows around them. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nTo date, Chizen''s name hasn''t had the name recognition of Gates, or Jobs or Ellison.  But if he succeeds in accomplishing all that he lays out in this interview, that may not be true much longer.\r\n\r\n  <center><p>[To browse all prior blog entries on this story, click <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blogcat.php?CID=30''>here</a>]     \r\n        \r\n<p><i> <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/subscribe/''>subscribe</a> to the free <b><a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/''>Consortium Standards Bulletin</a></i></b> (and remember to <i><b>Buy Your Books at <a href=''http://www.consortiuminfo.org/books/''>Biff''s)</a></b></i></center> </p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Yes', 0);
