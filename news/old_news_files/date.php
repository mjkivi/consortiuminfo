// If your local time is *behind* the server time, then change the "+" to

// it is a different setting to the server daylight saving/standard time

// Variable for hours

$hourdiff = "0"; // hours difference between server time and local time

// If you don't know how many hours, then "uncomment" the three lines
// below by deleting "// " to see what the server time is (remember to
// put the comments "// " back when you've finished checking:

// $serverdate = date("l, d F Y h:i a");
// print ("$serverdate");
// print (" &nbsp; <p>");

// Nothing needs to be changed below here unless you want to change
