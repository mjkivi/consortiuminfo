<meta name="description" content="Broadly stated, the basic objective of the US antitrust laws is to preserve and promote competition and the free enterprise system. They are premised on the assumption that private enterprise and free competition are the most efficient ways to allocate resources, to produce goods at the lowest possible price and to assure the production of high quality products. At their simplest, the antitrust laws require that business people make independent business decisions without consultation or agreement with competitors.">

Standard-setting and consortia (such as the World Wide Web Consortium) are cornerstones of the modern technology-based world, and ConsortiumInfo.org is the most detailed and comprehensive single resource on (or off) the Internet on these topics. Its unique design makes it equally valuable for both casual users and serious researchers alike. </font></p>
                                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ConsortiumInfo.org provides a wealth of information on all topics relevant to standards and consortia, including: why consortia are formed; how to evaluate joining a consortium; government policy; certification and branding; intellectual property rights policies; laws, cases and regulations; and other topics important to standard setting work. It also compiles news and press releases from the standards and consortium industry, and provides a forum for debate.</font></p>
                                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, there are hundreds of consortia creating thousands of standards in all conceivable technical areas, from the mundane to the most exotic. These standards underlie and enable the rapid evolution of new technologies in areas such as telecommunications, the Internet, bioinformatics, and web services. Currently the activities of consortia are coming under increasing scrutiny by antitrust regulators, as some participants in the standard setting process push the intellectual property rights envelope and consortia strive to adapt their policies to meet the challenge.<br>
                                <br>
&quot;More than ever, the world is dependent on standards&#8221;, said Andrew Updegrove, a nationally recognized expert in standard setting and consortium practices and a partner at Gesmer Updegrove. &quot;Right now, there's substantial litigation in process alleging standards abuse, the Federal Trade Commission has intervened and the Justice Department and FTC are considering issuing new guidelines. As a result, a large percentage of consortia are struggling with the challenge of moving forward while large companies become increasingly insecure about the nature of their participation.&#8221;</font></p>
                                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Updegrove, who has represented and helped structure more than 60 worldwide standard-setting consortia, including some of the largest standard setting organizations in the world, underscored the uniqueness of the site by saying: &#8220;What little information is available on these topics elsewhere is fragmented and sparse. Before we created this site, it was extremely difficult to gain either an in-depth or a comprehensive knowledge of the standard setting process and the organizations that manage that process. Between the book-length content that we have created at the site and the hundreds of annotated links to laws, articles, consortia, websites and other resources that we have provided, both the casual visitor as well as the academic researcher can find whatever they need. Without being publicized, the site is already being used on a daily basis by visitors from all over the world.&#8221;</font></p>
                                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The site is also designed to be highly interactive, enabling those involved in the standard-setting and consortium world to post questions at moderated discussion boards, email pages to others, submit press releases, links and news, and otherwise interact as a community.</font></p>

A consortium is a group of companies that join together to accomplish a specific goal. </strong>In the technology industry, they most frequently join together to set standards to enable the development of new infrastructures (e.g., for the Internet and telecommunications), products (e.g., high definition television and wireless peripheral devices), software (e.g., Linux for business users) and services (e.g., web services). Without agreement between multiple vendors on such standards, none of these processes, contracts, or services could be successful. Most consortia also promote these new technologies, in order to educate potential customers and create demand. There are hundreds of consortia in operation today, supporting thousands of standards.</font></p>

                                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.gesmer.com/attorneys/updegrove.php">Andrew Updegrove</a>, a partner in the Boston law firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, has been helping create and representing technology consortia since 1988. During that time period, he and his firm have been retained by many of the largest technology companies in the world to assist them in forming consortia. He has also written and spoken frequently on the topics of consortia and standard setting, and has given testimony to the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission on the same topics.<br>
        Over time, it became increasingly clear to him that there was no centralized resource to which he could direct his clients (who, in most instances, had not been involved in consortium formation previously) in order that they could become more familiar with the subject area. In order to address this need, he and other personnel of his firm worked together to create ConsortiumInfo.org.</font></p>
                                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Besides working with consortia, he has a broad range of experience in representing both mature and emerging high technology (and particularly software and Internet) companies in all aspects of their legal affairs. The greatest part of his time over more than 20 years in practice has been spent counseling many hundreds of emerging high technology and other fast growth clients. He spends a significant part of his time giving strategic advice to clients of the firm, and was recently named one of the &quot;Best VC Lawyers&quot; in Boston by the Digital Industry News.</font></p>
                                      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mr. Updegrove is a graduate of Yale University and the Cornell University Law School. He is a certified mediator, and a member of the Panel of Mediators of the Massachusetts Software and Internet Council. Outside the office, he is the Moderator of the Old North Church in Marblehead, the Treasurer of the Vinalhaven [Maine] Land Trust, and a founder of Patrons of the Arts, a non-profit organization that helps newly-graduated artists launch their careers.<br>
